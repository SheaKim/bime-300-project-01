History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman who was admitted for placement of 
bilateral common iliac artery stents for peripheral vascular 
disease for nonhealing toe ulcer on [**3-3**] and thrombin injection 
for left common femoral pseudoaneurysm. She was s/p op day 2 and 
was to be discharged when she developed the sudden onset of 
shortness of breath. Her BP was 190/90 and O2 sat 68% on 4 L NC 
she went up to 72%. An arterial blood gas obtained showed 
7.28/47/51. She was started on a nitro drip and lasix IV. She 
had rales all the way up and upon emergent intubation, froth was 
visualized in ET tube.

Family History:
DM (mother)
 
Physical Exam:
afebrile, BP 126/76, HR 74,
Gen: pleasant and cooperative
HEENT: MMM, CN II-XII grossly intact
Cor: RRR III/VI systolic murmur heard throughout the precordium
Pulm: mild crackles bilaterally
Abd: soft, NT ND + BS
Ext: WWP, friable skin, trace pitting edema LE bilaterally, left 
toe with 2 x 2 cm ulcer. Pedal pulses not palpable but are 
dopplerable.
 
Pertinent Results:
CXR: The heart size is enlarged compared to the film from the 
prior day. There is bilateral pleural effusions, left greater 
than right. There is increased retrocardiac opacity that may be 
due to effusion/consolidation/atelectasis. There is pulmonary 
vascular redistribution. Compared to the film from the prior 
day, the effusions are larger, the retrocardiac opacity is 
greater but the remainder of the lungs have a slightly improved 
appearance.

EKG with increased lateral ST segment depressions and TW 
inversions.

TTE Conclusions: Ejection Fraction: 40%. The aortic valve 
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is 
moderate-to-severe aortic valve stenosis with mild aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately 
thickened. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired 
relaxation. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the 
findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**3164-3-9**], 
the mean pressure gradient across the aortic valve is marginally 
reduced.  

catheterization with Common iliac stenting: 
1. Retrograde access of bilateral CFA were obtained. 
2. Diffuse peripheral vascular disease was noted in bilateral 
lower 
extremities. The abdominal aorta had mild distal disease. The 
renal 
arteries were single without apparent flow-limiting disease. 
3. The right lower extremity had proximal disease. The CIA had a 
70% 
origin lesion with mild calcification. The EIA had mild disease 
that was 
no flow-limiting. The CFA was without flow-limiting disease. 
4. The left lower extremity had disease througout its course. 
The CIA 
had a long tubular 80% lesion. The EIA had mild diffuse disease. 
The 
CFA was without flow-limiting disease. The SFA was totally 
occluded 
proximally. The PFA provided robust collaterals to the 
popliteal. The 
PT and PA supply run-off to the foot. The AT is severely 
diseased with 
reconstitution of the DP from PA collaterals. 
5. Limited hemodynamics revealed a significant lesion in both 
the RFA 
and LFA compared to the central aorta with a 15 mmHg gradient 
noted 
after administration of IA nitroglycerin. This gradient 
disappeared 
after intervention. Opening pressures were markedly elevated 
with blood 
pressure 210/69 mmHg. 
6. Successful stenting of bilateral CIA with ""kissing stents"" 
using a 
7.0 x 28 mm Omnilink in the right and 7.0 x 38 mm Omnilink in 
the left. 
postdilation was with 7.0 mm balloons. Final angiography 
demonstrated no 
residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and 
normal 
flow. FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Bilateral common iliac artery disease. 
2. Severe diffuse arterial disease in the left lower extremity. 
3. Severe central hypertension. 
4. Successful treatment of bilateral CIA disease with stenting. 

cardiac catheterization: COMMENTS:      
1.  Selective coronary angiography revealed a right-dominant 
system with 
severe 3-vessel coronary disease.  The LMCA was heavily 
calcified with a 
distal 70% stenosis involving the origin of the LAD and LCx.  
The LAD 
had heavy proximal calcification and an ostial 90% stenosis.  
The prior 
LAD stent was widely patent, and there was mild distal diffuse 
disease. 
The LCx had an ostial calcific 80% stenosis.  The RCA had an 
ostial 80% 
stenosis.  The previous RCA stent was widely patent.  There was 
also a 
60% stenosis in the distal RCA at the origin of the RPDA. 
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right- and mildly 
elevated 
left-sided filling pressures (mean RA 6 mmHg, mean PCW 13 mmHg). 
 The 
pulmonary artery pressure was moderately elevated (mean PA 34 
mmHg). 
The cardiac output was low-normal at 2.3 L/min/m2.  Simultaneous 

measurement of arterial and left ventricular pressures critical 
aortic 
stenosis.  The peak-peak gradient across the aortic valve was 78 
mmHg, 
the mean gradient was 56 mmHg, and the calculated aortic valve 
area was 
0.48 cm2.  Post-valvuloplasty (see below), the peak-peak 
gradient 
decreased to 32 mmHg, the mean gradient to 28 mmHg, and the 
calculated 
valve area increased to 0.69 cm2. 
3. Successful aortic valvuloplasty with a 22 x 60 mm balloon. 
Final 
valve calculation demonstrated a valve area of 0.69 cm2. No 
apparent 
complications were noted after the procedure (See PTCA 
Comments). 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Severe 3-vessel coronary disease. 
2. Minimal diastolic dysfunction. 
3. Critical aortic stenosis. 
4. Successful aortic baloon valvuloplasty without apparent 
complications. 

extremity catheterization:      
1. Retrograde access was obtained via the right femoral artery 
to the 
contralateral TPT. There was mild distal aortic disease. The 
previously 
placed right iliac artery stent was without significant 
stenoses. The 
prior left iliac artery stent was without significant stenoses. 
The left 
common femoral artery was without obstructive disease. The left 
superficial femoral artery was totally occluded at its origin. 
The left 
profunda femoris artery supplied collaterals to the popliteal 
artery. 
The trifurcation was without significant disease though the 
posterior 
tibial artery was totally occluded proximally. The peroneal and 
anterior 
tibial arteries filled the ankle to the foot. 
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal central blood 
pressures 
of 135/43 mmHg. 
3. Successful placement of three overlapping self-expanding 
stents in 
the previously, chronically, totally occluded left SFA (from 
proximal to 
distal 7.0 x 38 mm Dynalink, 7.0 x 100 mm Dynalink, and 6.0 x 
100 mm 
Dynalink) all postdilated with a 5.0 mm balloon. Final 
angiography 
demonstrated a 10% residual stenosis and normal flow (See PTCA 
Comments). 
4. Successful treatment of popliteal artery with a 5.0 x 40 mm 
cryoplasty balloon over 5 inflations. Final angiography 
demonstrated a 
10% residual stenosis and normal flow (See PTCA Comments). 
5. Successful placement of 7.0 x 28 mm Genesis stent in the 
disrupted 
right common iliac artery stent as well as balloon angioplasty 
using the 
stent delivery balloon in the left common iliac artery stent to 
smooth 
out the struts due to this difficult procedure.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Totally occluded left superficial femoral artery (SFA). 
2. Totally occluded posterior tibial artery. 
3. Normal central blood pressure. 
4. Successful placement of self-expanding stents in left SFA. 
5. Successful cryoplasty of left SFA into popliteal artery. 
6. Successful placement of stent in right common iliac artery. 
7. Successful angioplasty of left common iliac artery stent.

THREE VIEWS LEFT FOOT: When compared with the prior three views 
left great toe dated [**3163-7-6**], there is evidence of 
interval debridement, and bony removal at the base of the first 
distal left phalanx. There is no significant periosteal reaction 
or sinus tract to suggest osteomyelitis. The bones are severely 
mineralized. There are no focal lesions. There is no evidence of 
fracture or malalignment. There is no effusion. The joint spaces 
are preserved. The surrounding soft tissues reveal a diffuse 
vasculopathy.

BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VEINS ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and color 
Doppler images of both common femoral, superficial femoral, and 
popliteal veins were obtained. Normal waveforms, 
compressibility, and augmentation was demonstrated. No 
intraluminal thrombus is identified. Noted is a small right 
popliteal fossa cyst. Also seen is a small, 2.8 x 1.1 cm 
hematoma within the subcutaneous tissues of the left groin.
IMPRESSION:
1) No evidence of lower extremity DVT.
2) Small right popliteal fossa cyst.
3) Small left groin hematoma.

GRAM STAIN (Final [**3164-3-10**]): 1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   
POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES. NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN. WOUND 
CULTURE (Final [**3164-3-13**]): STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE. 
SPARSE GROWTH. ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**3164-3-14**]):  NO ANAEROBES 
ISOLATED. 

CT of the head without contrast. FINDINGS: No hydrocephalus, 
shift of normally midline structures, intracranial mass lesion, 
or loss of [**Doctor Last Name 898**]-white differentiation is noted. No intracranial 
hemorrhage is seen. Mild prominence of the ventricles and sulci 
is probably appropriate for the patient's age. Scleral bands are 
noted in each eye. Soft tissues and osseous structures are 
otherwise unremarkable. IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial 
abnormality. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female who was admitted for elective 
common iliac stenting and has a pertinent history of aortic 
stenosis. 

In terms of her pump function bedside echo showed moderate 
global HK. A formal TTE showed a reduced EF. She then had a 
cardiac catheterization which showed 3 vessel disease. CT 
surgery was asked to comment and determined that she is not a 
candidate for CABG. Her medical management was optimized with 
Toprol XL, ACEI, lasix BID, atorvastatin, aspirin and isosorbide 
dinitrate. She was euvolemic at discharge.

Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular 
response, likely precipitating an episode acute pulmonary edema 
on floor [**3-7**]. She did not respond to diuresis and was 
emergently inubated. She was transferred to the cardiac care 
unit for mechanical ventilation. She was diuresed overnight and 
spontaneously converted into NSR. She was extubated the 
following morning without any complications. Once stable, 
valvuloplasty was performed, increasing her valve area and 
decreasing pressure differential (the peak-peak gradient 
decreased to 32 mmHg, the mean gradient to 28 mmHg, and the 
calculated valve area increased to 0.69 cm2). 

For her peripheral vascular disease, she had common iliac artery 
stents and a superior femoral artery stent placed. She was on 
levofloxacin 250 QD at admission for her nonhealing toe ulcer. 
She was seen by the podiatry service. They were able to probe to 
bone, indicating that she has osteomyelitis. Cultures showed 
coag negative staph. She was started on a 6 week course of 
oxacillin and the levofloxacin was stopped since there were no 
gram negatives on her swab. Her plavix 75 QD was continued.

Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] has type II DM. Her pioglitazone was stopped when it was 
discovered that she has decreased cardiac function and CHF. She 
was controlled with a regular insulin sliding scale. She was 
started on glipizide prior to discharge.

Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] developed some acute renal failure, with a creatinine 
that went from 1 at admit to 1.2. This was likely from the dye 
loads she received during her 3 catheterizations, despite 
efforts to protect her kidneys with acetylcysteine and 
bicarbonate. It is expected that this will go back to baseline. 

Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] became anemic following her interventions. Her HCT 
dropped from 39 to 25 and she was transfused a unit of blood. 
Her hematocrit was stable at discharge. 

Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] has a history of dementia. She was continued on aricept 
and namenda.

     INDICATION:  Left-sided PICC placement.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Single portal AP view of the chest was obtained, compared with
     examination from 6 days ago.
     
     FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a left-sided PICC with tip in
     the lower SVC.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged, and there
     is persistence of left retrocardiac opacity, slightly improved.  A nodular
     density in the right mid lung zones probably represents confluence of
     overlying structures as this was not evident on the prior examinations.  There
     is osteopenia and a possible tiny left pleural effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION:  PICC at lower SVC.

     HISTORY:  Recent left SFA to posterior tibial artery bypass graft now with
     left-sided osteomyelitis.
     
     FINDINGS:  Study is compared to a prior study done 6 days earlier.  Doppler
     evaluation indicates monophasic waveforms diffusely and bilaterally that at
     the PT level bilaterally is absent.  ABI measurements area inaccurate due to
     vessel noncompressibility.  Waveforms continue to show diffuse widening and
     low amplitude with minimal amplitude at the digital level bilaterally.
     Findings overall are in accord with those performed on [**3164-6-5**] and
     indicating significant arterial insufficiency to both lower extremities
     starting at the iliac level and continuing throughout to the tibial level.

     sided PICC line whose tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  No
     pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Allowing for differences in technique, the
     cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged.  The pulmonary vessels
     are unremarkable.  The previously noted left retrocardiac opacity and left
     pleural effusion have resolved. The osseous structures are osteopenic.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Tip of PICC line at cavoatrial junction. No acute process.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Surveillance after recent balloon angioplasty and stent placement
     in the left superficial femoral artery in a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman.
     
     COMPARISON:  Prior similar examination from 8 days ago.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  Recording of continuous Doppler signal showed
     monophasic waveforms in the bilateral femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and
     dorsalis pedis arteries.  As compared to the prior examination, this appears
     similar except for the presence of detectable signal in the bilateral
     posterior tibial arteries today (signal was absent on the last examination).
     
     Pulse volume recording shows clearly improved waveforms in the left lower
     thigh, calf and somewhat at the metatarsal level as well.  No significant
     improvement is seen on the left toe level.  On the right side, the waveforms
     and values seem unchanged or slightly worsened.
     
     As before, measurement of segmental limb pressure indices remain inaccurate
     due to non-compressibility of the vessels.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Interval improvement in arterial flow in the left lower extremity
     at the femoral popliteal and infrapopliteal levels as shown by pulse volume
     recordings.  No evidence of improvement at the left digital level.  Stable
     appearance on the right side.
