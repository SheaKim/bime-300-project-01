HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old
female who is status post colonoscopy and sigmoid polyp
biopsy approximately 10 days prior to presentation.  She is a
resident of [**Hospital3 2594**].  At
the [**Hospital3 1004**] Center the patient was noted to be
complaining of diffuse abdominal pain over the past three
days.  She was taken to the Emergency Room at the [**Hospital1 392**] where she was noted to be febrile,
diffusely tender.  White count was 18,000.  Chest x-ray
revealed free air under the diaphragm.  She was resuscitated
in the Emergency Room and given antibiotics.  She was
subsequently taken to the operating room for exploratory
laparotomy.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room
emergently and underwent an exploratory laparotomy which
revealed rupture of sigmoid colon.  A sigmoid colectomy with
a diverting colostomy was performed.  The patient was stable,
intubated, to the surgical Intensive Care Unit.  Over the
next several days the patient did well and support was
weaned.  She was subsequently extubated and transferred to
the floor in stable condition.  On the floor it appears that
the patient had an episode of possible aspiration, was found
in respiratory distress and was transported back to surgical
Intensive Care Unit in fair condition.  Of note, her
abdominal incision was opened for drainage.  The course was
[**Male First Name (un) 8388**] over the next several days and after extensive
discussions with the family, the patient was made comfort
measures only.  She expired shortly thereafter.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Ruptured sigmoid colon.
2.  Feculent peritonitis.
3.  Aspiration pneumonia.
4.  Sepsis.
5.  Respiratory failure.
6.  Refractory sepsis.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Rule out abscess.  Patient status post bowel perforation with
     exploratory laparotomy and Hartmann's procedure.
     
     Enhanced contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung bases to the
     pubic symphysis.  150 cc of Optiray was injected through a triple lumen by
     hand.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  No complications.
     
     ENHANCED ABDOMEN:  The upper lung fields are clear.  There is bilateral
     pleural effusion and associated subsegmental atelectasis.  The visualized
     heart is unremarkable.  There is vascular calcification consistent with
     atherosclerotic disease.  The liver is unremarkable.  There is thickening of
     the wall of the gallbladder probably related to the ascites.  No radiopaque
     gallstones are visualized.  The pancreas is unremarkable.  There are
     geographic hypodensities noted throughout the spleen which has maintained its
     normal shape and configuration.  There is enhancement of the capsule.  This is
     suggestive of multiple splenic infarcts.  There is a filling defect within the
     splenic vein, celiac axis and hepatic artery.  These persists on multiple post
     contrast sequences consistent with thrombosis. The adrenal glands are normal.
     The kidneys are normal with prompt excretion of contrast.
     
     PELVIS:  The visualized small and large bowel are unremarkable.  There is a
     small amount of fluid within the right paracolic gutter and a larger pocket
     within the left paracolic gutter.  These do not appear loculated.  There is
     also a small fluid collection within the cul-de-sac in the dependent aspect.
     The uterus and bladder are unremarkable.  There are no intraluminal filling
     defects.  There is air within the bladder probably secondary to Foley
     placement.
     
     There is stranding within the omentum and mesentery probably secondary to the
     fluid.
     
     The patient has a left lower abdomen colostomy.  The osseous structures are
     unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Multiple hypodensities throughout the spleen consistent with a
     splenic infarct.  There is ascites with no loculated effusions.  There is
     thickening of the gallbladder probably related to ascites.
     
     There is clot with the celiac axis and the hepatic artery.  There is also
     splenic [**Last Name (un) **] thrombosis.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Rule out abscess.  Patient status post bowel perforation with
     exploratory laparotomy and Hartmann's procedure.
     
     Enhanced contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung bases to the
     pubic symphysis.  150 cc of Optiray was injected through a triple lumen by
     hand.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  No complications.
     
     ENHANCED ABDOMEN:  The upper lung fields are clear.  There is bilateral
     pleural effusion and associated subsegmental atelectasis.  The visualized
     heart is unremarkable.  There is vascular calcification consistent with
     atherosclerotic disease.  The liver is unremarkable.  There is thickening of
     the wall of the gallbladder probably related to the ascites.  No radiopaque
     gallstones are visualized.  The pancreas is unremarkable.  There are
     geographic hypodensities noted throughout the spleen which has maintained its
     normal shape and configuration.  There is enhancement of the capsule.  This is
     suggestive of multiple splenic infarcts.  There is a filling defect within the
     splenic vein, celiac axis and hepatic artery.  These persists on multiple post
     contrast sequences consistent with thrombosis. The adrenal glands are normal.
     The kidneys are normal with prompt excretion of contrast.
     
     PELVIS:  The visualized small and large bowel are unremarkable.  There is a
     small amount of fluid within the right paracolic gutter and a larger pocket
     within the left paracolic gutter.  These do not appear loculated.  There is
     also a small fluid collection within the cul-de-sac in the dependent aspect.
     The uterus and bladder are unremarkable.  There are no intraluminal filling
     defects.  There is air within the bladder probably secondary to Foley
     placement.
     
     There is stranding within the omentum and mesentery probably secondary to the
     fluid.
     
     The patient has a left lower abdomen colostomy.  The osseous structures are
     unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Multiple hypodensities throughout the spleen consistent with a
     splenic infarct.  There is ascites with no loculated effusions.  There is
     thickening of the gallbladder probably related to ascites.
     
     There is clot with the celiac axis and the hepatic artery.  There is also
     splenic [**Last Name (un) **] thrombosis.

     disorder, swelling of left upper extremity, rule out DVT.
     
     FINDINGS:  [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and color Doppler ultrasound were performed.  There is
     normal compressibility, color flow and Doppler signal within the left internal
     jugular vein and subclavian vein.  In the left internal jugular vein, a
     rouleaux phenomenon is observed from slow flow.  Within the mid-axillary vein,
     there is a thrombus occluding approximately 50% of the vessel lumen over a
     length of 2 cm.  The brachial vein and cephalic vein are unremarkable.  The
     external jugular vein is dilated and noncompressible.  No color flow is
     identified within it.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Nonocclusive thrombus in the mid-axillary vein and complete thrombosis of
     the external jugular vein.
     
     The results were discussed with the residents taking care of the patient at

     CT LOCALIZATION GUIDANCE AND ASPIRATION OF A PELVIC FLUID COLLECTION, [**3100-11-13**]:
     
     CT LOCALIZATION:  A limited CT scan of the pelvis was obtained without oral or
     IV contrast.  This study is compared to the previous scan from [**3100-11-11**]. The
     previously seen fluid collection in the left lower quadrant is still present
     and similar in size and shape.  There are normal loops of nondistended bowel.
     Using direct CT guiadance, a spot on the skin was marked directly overlying
     the fluid collection in the left lower quadrant.
     
     CT GUIDED NEEDLE PLACEMENT:  Informed consent for the procedure was obtained
     from [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 12021**] [**Known patient lastname 3195**], who is the patient's daughter and proxy for medical
     decisions.  This consent was placed on the chart.  The patient was prepped and
     draped in a sterile fashion.  5 cc of 1% Lidocaine was injected subdermally. A
     20 g. spinal needle was advanced into the fluid collection.
     
     CT ASPIRATION:  10 cc of serosanguineous fluid was aspirated through the
     spinal needle and sent to the lab for culture.  The needle was removed and no
     drain was placed.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.  The
     patient was sent back to the floor.
     
     IMPRESSION:  CT guided aspiration of peritoneal fluid for culture.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11864**] was present for and directly supervised the procedure.

     and similar in size and shape.  There are normal loops of nondistended bowel.
     Using direct CT guiadance, a spot on the skin was marked directly overlying
     the fluid collection in the left lower quadrant.
     
     CT GUIDED NEEDLE PLACEMENT:  Informed consent for the procedure was obtained
     from [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 12021**] [**Known patient lastname 3195**], who is the patient's daughter and proxy for medical
     decisions.  This consent was placed on the chart.  The patient was prepped and
     draped in a sterile fashion.  5 cc of 1% Lidocaine was injected subdermally. A
     20 g. spinal needle was advanced into the fluid collection.
     
     CT ASPIRATION:  10 cc of serosanguineous fluid was aspirated through the
     spinal needle and sent to the lab for culture.  The needle was removed and no
     drain was placed.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.  The
     patient was sent back to the floor.
     
     IMPRESSION:  CT guided aspiration of peritoneal fluid for culture.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11864**] was present for and directly supervised the procedure.

     CT CHEST, ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST, [**3100-11-16**]
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION: 78 year old woman with long post-op course.  Having acute
     desaturations with asystole and continued elevated white count.  Evaluate for
     pulmonary embolus and abdominal abscess.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained from the neck to the pubic
     symphysis.  150 cc Optiray nonionic IV contrast were administered due to rapid
     rate of bolus required for the procedure.
     
     Prior studies from [**3100-11-11**] were available for direct comparison.
     
     CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a small interval increase in the size of
     bilateral pleural effusions with associated lung consolidation.  In the right
     upper lobe is an area of consolidation without air bronchograms.  Given that
     PO contrast is seen within the patient's esophagus this likely represents an
     aspiration pneumonia.  The heart and great vessels are grossly normal.  No
     emboli are seen within the pulmonary arterial vasculature.  Endotracheal tube
     is seen above the carina.  There is compensatory hyperinflation of the left
     lobe to compensate for loss of lung volume in the right.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: NG tube is present within the stomach.  There
     continue to be multiple fluid collections throughout the abdomen and pelvis
     not noticably changed from the previous study.  There is a small amount of
     interval progression of the splenic infarct.  Loculated fluid collections
     around the liver are unchanged.  I cannot determine if these collections are
     subcapsular or posterior to the liver.  The clot in the SMA is visualized. The
     SMV is beginning to recannulize.  The small bowel is dilated with multiple
     air-fluid levels.  The portion of bowel entering the ostomy site is
     decompressed.  The previously seen surgical site along the anterior abdominal
     wall has increased in size.  There is no communication between this surgical
     site and the bowel.  There is no contrast seen within the surgical site.
     However there is not contrast throughout the entire length of the small bowel.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum and remnants of sigmoid colon are
     compressed.  The bladder is catheterized and compressed.  The uterus is
     grossly unremarkable.  There is no abscess seen within the pelvis.  Bone
     windows show unremarkable osseous structures.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) Continued multiple fluid collections within the abdomen.
                                                                 (Over)

     3) Aspiration pneumonia with slight increase in size of pleural effusions.
     
     4) No evidence for abdominal abscess or fistula between the bowel and the
     abdominal wall incision.
     
     These findings were discussed with the surgical team on multiple occasions. If
     fistula remains a clinical concern, then repeat scan at a lateral time after
     oral contrast has had a chance to advance further through the bowel would be
     useful.  This study has been recommended to the treating team.

     FINDINGS: ETT is seen within the trachea in the proper position. An NG tube is
     seen within the stomach. Swan-Ganz catheter is introduced through the right
     side and its tip is within the right pulmonary artery. There is bilateral
     pleural effusions more evident on the right side. Underlying infiltrate
     difficult to exclude. Comparison was made to previous chest x ray dated
     [**3100-11-16**], there is less fluid on the left side compared to the previous study.
     
     IMPRESSION: New Swan-Ganz catheter with tip over right pulmonary artery. No
     ptx detected.   Right pleural effusion as described. Left pleural effusion
     less marked than the previous chest x ray.

     CHEST, SINGLE VIEW:  Direct comparison was made to a prior study dated
     [**3100-11-11**].  No significant change in lines and tubes.  There is interval
     increase in a layering right pleural effusion which is now moderate in size.
     There is interval increase in opacity in the right peri- and infrahilar
     regions with apparent air bronchograms and this may represent a focus of
     pneumonia.  The lucency in the left upper lung is thought to be related to
     artifact.  No failure.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Increased opacity with apparent air bronchograms in the right perihilar
     and infrahilar region which could represent a focus of pneumonia.
     2.  A now moderate right effusion and smaller left effusion.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CT CHEST, ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST, [**3100-11-16**]
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION: 78 year old woman with long post-op course.  Having acute
     desaturations with asystole and continued elevated white count.  Evaluate for
     pulmonary embolus and abdominal abscess.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained from the neck to the pubic
     symphysis.  150 cc Optiray nonionic IV contrast were administered due to rapid
     rate of bolus required for the procedure.
     
     Prior studies from [**3100-11-11**] were available for direct comparison.
     
     CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a small interval increase in the size of
     bilateral pleural effusions with associated lung consolidation.  In the right
     upper lobe is an area of consolidation without air bronchograms.  Given that
     PO contrast is seen within the patient's esophagus this likely represents an
     aspiration pneumonia.  The heart and great vessels are grossly normal.  No
     emboli are seen within the pulmonary arterial vasculature.  Endotracheal tube
     is seen above the carina.  There is compensatory hyperinflation of the left
     lobe to compensate for loss of lung volume in the right.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: NG tube is present within the stomach.  There
     continue to be multiple fluid collections throughout the abdomen and pelvis
     not noticably changed from the previous study.  There is a small amount of
     interval progression of the splenic infarct.  Loculated fluid collections
     around the liver are unchanged.  I cannot determine if these collections are
     subcapsular or posterior to the liver.  The clot in the SMA is visualized. The
     SMV is beginning to recannulize.  The small bowel is dilated with multiple
     air-fluid levels.  The portion of bowel entering the ostomy site is
     decompressed.  The previously seen surgical site along the anterior abdominal
     wall has increased in size.  There is no communication between this surgical
     site and the bowel.  There is no contrast seen within the surgical site.
     However there is not contrast throughout the entire length of the small bowel.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum and remnants of sigmoid colon are
     compressed.  The bladder is catheterized and compressed.  The uterus is
     grossly unremarkable.  There is no abscess seen within the pelvis.  Bone
     windows show unremarkable osseous structures.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) Continued multiple fluid collections within the abdomen.
                                                                 (Over)
