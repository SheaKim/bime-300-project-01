Admission Date:  [**2832-6-23**]       Discharge Date:  [**2832-8-20**]

Date of Birth:   [**2769-6-30**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old
woman with a history of hypertension and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease who was transferred from [**Hospital 9440**] Medical Center with a large right
intraparenchymal hemorrhage and bilateral subarachnoid blood
throughout the sulci, Hunt and [**Doctor Last Name 7911**] Grade V.  The patient was
sitting alone at a restaurant this evening when she became
unresponsive.  She was intubated at the scene and was brought to
an outside hospital.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Hypertension.  2. Arthritis.  3.
Question of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination she was intubated,
sedated and paralyzed.  Her blood pressure was 135/53, heart
rate 49, respiratory rate 23, saturating 100%.  The right
pupil was 5 and nonreactive; left was 3�� and slightly
reactive.  Lungs had equal breath sounds but with some
rhonchi.  Respiratory rate was stable.  Cardiac was regular
rate and rhythm, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  Abdomen was
nontender, positive bowel sounds, nondistended.  Extremities
had no edema, bilateral pulses.  She was intubated and
sedated.  She withdrew her left leg and left arm and right
foot to painful stimuli.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the intensive care unit
for close neurologic observation after transfer from an
outside hospital.  She had a left ventricular drain placed on
admission.  On [**2832-7-3**] the patient remained intubated and
sedated.  Pupils were 3 down to 2 mm bilaterally.  She had
coiling done for a ruptured middle cerebral and anterio
communicating artery aneurysms on [**2832-7-3**], and then was taken to
the operating room for craniectomy.  Her postoperative course
was complicated by pulmonary edema and adult respiratory
distress syndrome, as well as the need for ventricular drain
placement.  The patient grew out gram-negative rods in her
blood and was on Cipro and ceftazidime for treating blood
sepsis.  She also had Klebsiella in her sputum and an episode
of elevated liver function tests.  She had a right upper
quadrant ultrasound.  The patient was on Levophed and
Neo-Synephrine to keep her blood pressure up.  She had
episodes of pulmonary edema requiring Lasix.  She had a Swan
placed on [**2832-6-25**].  On [**2832-6-26**] she had bursts of atrial
fibrillation and flutter with narrow-complex tachycardia.
She was started on Lopressor.  She was less arousable on
[**2832-6-27**] and had a head CT that showed increased swelling.
Her ICPs were 15-24 at that time and her drain was at 0.  She
had a CT on [**2832-6-29**] that showed worsening bleeding and also
again on [**2832-6-30**].  She was sedated and paralyzed.  She
continued to have problems with atrial fibrillation and
flutter and was on Lopressor.  On the 17th she had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
bolt placed.  Her ICP was 17-20.  Her CT was unchanged.  On
[**2832-7-2**] she had an angiogram that showed no spasm and her CT
was unchanged.  On [**2832-7-3**] her saturations dropped along
with her oxygenation and her pressor requirements were
increasing.  On [**2832-7-6**] she was off sedation.  Her CT was
unchanged.  She had the vent drain placed on [**2832-7-8**] for
hydrocephalus.

Neurologically her craniotomy site was pulsatile.  Her pupils
were 4 down to 2 mm and symmetric.  There was no movement in
the extremities.  She had positive corneal reflexes
bilaterally.

On [**2832-7-8**] her pupils were equal and reactive to light.  She
did not withdraw to pain in her upper extremities.  She did
not grimace to pain.  She did not withdraw her lower
extremities.  She did have positive corneals.  The vent drain
was placed on [**2832-7-8**].

On [**2832-7-9**] the patient's neurological status was unchanged.
She was unresponsive except for left foot withdrawal to pain.
Pupils were 3 mm and were briskly reactive.  She had a weak
gag and weak cough reflex.  Her [**Last Name (un) **] bolt ICP levels were
[**3-24**].  Ventricular drain noted to be [**7-25**].  Her sites were
clean, dry and intact.  She continued on Levophed and
Neo-Synephrine drips to titrate to keep her pressure 150-180.

On [**2832-7-11**] neurologically she had slight withdrawal to deep
nail bed pressure on the left lower extremity, otherwise did
not respond to withdrawal, pain, or sternal rub.  She did
open her eyes at times but did not track.  She had positive
corneals.  Pupils were 4-5 mm and brisk.  Vent drain remained
in place and the [**Last Name (un) **] bolt, and were both intact with ICPs
[**3-25**].

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 321**] met with the family on [**2832-7-12**] and the plan was to
continue current treatment.  On [**2832-7-12**] the amlodipine was
discontinued and the patient's triple H therapy was weaned
off.  The family wished to continue with the current care.
On [**2832-7-13**] her brain flap was soft.  Her eyes were open
spontaneously, her pupils were equal, round and reactive to
light.  She had no movement to painful stimulation and no
spontaneous movement.

On [**2832-7-15**] the patient had PEG and tracheostomy placement
without intraoperative complications.  Neurologically she
opened her eyes, looked around the room, did not follow
commands, grimaced to painful stimulation in the upper and
lower extremities with small movement of the left lower
extremity.

On [**2832-7-3**] she had Klebsiella in her blood and was continued
on vancomycin for IV antibiotics.

On [**2832-7-18**] the patient had swelling in the left upper
extremity.  Vascular surgery was consulted.  An ultrasound
revealed a thrombus in the left subclavian and axillary veins
with flow in the cephalic vein, no flow in the brachial.  The
patient therefore had a superior vena cava filter placed on
[**2832-7-18**].

Bone flap surgery actually was postponed due to positive
blood cultures.  The patient had gram-negative rods growing
in her blood.  Infectious disease was consulted.  The patient
was on Flagyl for anaerobes and being covered with
vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl for antibiotic coverage.
She had gram-positive cocci in her blood, thought to be a
contaminant and gram-negative rods in her blood also, but
that was not considered to be a contaminant.  Diagnosis was
VRE from a femoral stick on the 15th.  She was continued on
levofloxacin and Flagyl.  Vancomycin was changed to linezolid
600 mg p.o. b.i.d.

On [**2832-7-30**] the patient opened her eyes spontaneously and to
stimuli, roving eye movements, but following staff, not
following commands, no seizure activity, ventricular drain
was in place.

She had bone flap replaced on [**2832-8-4**] without intraoperative
complications.  Post procedure the patient was awake and
attentive, tracking movements with her eyes, not following
commands but moving her extremities to painful stimulation x
4.  Her drain was raised to 15 cm above the tragus.  Her
drain continued to be raised and was finally discontinued on
[**2832-8-10**], and the patient had a lumbar puncture the following
day with an ICP of 20.  She was transferred to the regular
floor on [**2832-8-11**].  She was awake, attentive, smiled
appropriately, was following commands centrally.  Pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light.  She moved the right
side spontaneously, more so than the left side but both sides
were moving.  She was afebrile and her vital signs were
stable.

On [**2832-8-18**] she went to the operating room for
ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement.  There were no
intraoperative complications.  Postoperatively she is awake,
alert, attentive, following midline commands, moving the
right side more spontaneously than the left side.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Dilantin 200 mg nasogastric q. 12 hours.  Her Dilantin
level was high and her Dilantin was held for three days.  Her
last level on [**2832-8-19**] was 15 and her dose was decreased to
200 nasogastric q. 12 hours.
2. Cefazolin 1 gram IV for 48 hours to be discontinued on
[**2832-8-20**].
3. Insulin sliding scale and fixed dose.
4. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q. day.
5. Epoetin 10,000 units subcutaneous three times a week,
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
6. Metoprolol 25 down her tube t.i.d.
7. Loperamide 2 mg p.o. q.i.d. p.r.n.
8. Miconazole powder topically q.i.d. p.r.n.

     CHEST AP PORTABLE: Comparison is made to the prior study obtained on [**2832-6-23**].
     Again noted is placement of NG tube, in the right subclavian central venous
     catheter, unchanged in position. The heart is at the upper limits of normal in
     size. There is interval development of retrocardiac opacity, obscuring the
     left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse/consolidation.
     There is no evidence of pneumothorax. There is no definite evidence of pleural
     effusion. The visualized osseous structures appear unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION: Interval development of left lower lobe collapse/consolidation.
     Left lower lobe pneumonia should be considered in the proper clinical setting.

     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Grade 5 subarachnoid hemorrhage.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same with a ruptured large right middle cerebral
     artery bifurcation aneurysm and an anterior communicating artery aneurysm with
     a daughter segment.  Status post coil embolization of the right middle
     cerebral artery via a right internal carotid artery microcatheter approach and
     status post coil embolization of the anterior communicating artery through a
     left internal carotid artery microcatheter based approach.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal anesthesia.
     
     INDICATION:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 2132**] is a 63 year old woman who had a high grade
     subarachnoid hemorrhage characterized by a right sylvian fissure clot.  After
     a period of a poorly reacting right pupil at the outside hospital, her pupils
     had since become equal and reactive and she is undergoing the cerebral
     angiogram in order to diagnose the source of the hemorrhage and also to
     provide endovascular treatment.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient's husband and her son were given a full and complete
     explanation of the procedure.  Specifically the indications, risks, benefits
     and alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail.  In addition the
     possible complications such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
     neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
     complications including the risk of coma and even death were outlined.  The
     patient's husband and her son understood and wished to proceed with the
     operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge single wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood a 5 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and kept
                                                                 (Over)

     on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     Right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, right subclavian
     artery, right vertebral artery, left common carotid artery, left internal
     carotid artery, left subclavian artery, and left vertebral artery.  At this
     point, evaluation of the patient's vessels revealed no evidence of carotid
     disease in the cervical bifurcation or intracranially.  Injection of the right
     internal carotid artery revealed the presence of a large anteriorly pointing
     middle cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysm measuring approximately 12 to 15
     mm in greatest diameter by 9 mm with a 6 to 7 mm neck.  There is a daughter
     aneurysm near the region of the neck which is probably of the rupture site. In
     addition, injection of the left internal carotid artery reveals the presence
     of a dominant left A1 segment in the anterior cerebral artery and an
     approximately 6 mm aneurysm with a daughter component which represents a high
     risk for subsequent rupture.  Injection of the bilateral subclavian arteries
     were within normal limits as were the vertebral arteries with no evidence of
     stenosis in the cervical segment or intracranially.  There is no evidence of
     posterior circulation aneurysm.  At this point, a decision was made to proceed
     with endovascular coil embolization using a two-stage approach.  The initial
     procedure centered treatment of the right middle cerebral artery aneurysm to
     that end.  The patient underwent placement of a 5 FR guide catheter into the
     right internal carotid artery.  Through that catheter a XL 10 microcatheter
     was guided over a microwire into the supraclinoid internal carotid artery
     across the intracranial bifurcation into the right middle cerebral artery and
     finally into the aneurysm.  With the microcatheter in this position and after
     obtaining a series of three-dimensional angiographic runs to obtain the best
     projection, a series of GDC coils were deployed into the aneurysm under
     constant surveillance.  These began with a GDC 10 3D 10 mm x 30 cm and
     continued for a total of 18 coils ending a GDC ultrasoft 2 [**12-18**] x 3 cm.  The
     last coil was not deployed because of herniation one of the middle cerebral
     artery branches and accordingly was removed.  Multiple surveillance mid
     embolization and post embolization three dimensional and biplane angiographic
     runs are performed which revealed no evidence of branch occlusion and showed
     good embolization of the aneurysm including the daughter aneurysm near the
     neck which was felt to be the rupture site.  At this point, the microcatheter
     was removed from the middle cerebral artery aneurysm and our attention was
     turned towards treatment of the left internal carotid artery approach leading
     to the anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  To that end, an SL 10
     microcatheter streamed shaped and the microwire was given a S-shaped and the
     microcatheter was navigated through the left internal carotid artery after
     placement of the guide catheter into the left internal carotid artery.  The
     microcatheter was guided into the left A1 segment of the anterior cerebral
     artery and then into the anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  With the
     microcath in this position, a series of GDC coils were deployed for a total of
     7 coils beginning with a GDC 3D 4 x 6 and ending a GDC 2 mm x 1 cm ultrasoft.
                                                                 (Over)

     A series of angiographic runs were performed including biplane runs which
     revealed no evidence of branch occlusion and near complete obliteration of the
     aneurysm with its coils.  At this point, biplane angiographic runs were
     performed of the left internal carotid artery to document the final result and
     the patient was transferred back to intensive care in stable condition.  There
     was no elevation of the intracranial pressure and the patient was administered
     a dose of intravenous heparin which was graded beginning with a very low dose
     and after deployment of a few coils into the right middle cerebral artery
     aneurysm was taken to an ACT closer to then greater than 200 seconds.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Ruptured right middle cerebral artery aneurysm and anterior
     communicating artery aneurysm treated via a right internal carotid artery and
     left internal carotid artery approaches respectively using microcatheter-based
     GDC coils.

     INDICATION:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 2132**] is a 63 year old woman who had a high grade
     subarachnoid hemorrhage characterized by a right sylvian fissure clot.  After
     a period of a poorly reacting right pupil at the outside hospital, her pupils
     had since become equal and reactive and she is undergoing the cerebral
     angiogram in order to diagnose the source of the hemorrhage and also to
     provide endovascular treatment.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient's husband and her son were given a full and complete
     explanation of the procedure.  Specifically the indications, risks, benefits
     and alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail.  In addition the
     possible complications such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
     neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
     complications including the risk of coma and even death were outlined.  The
     patient's husband and her son understood and wished to proceed with the
     operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge single wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood a 5 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and kept
                                                                 (Over)

     on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     Right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, right subclavian
     artery, right vertebral artery, left common carotid artery, left internal
     carotid artery, left subclavian artery, and left vertebral artery.  At this
     point, evaluation of the patient's vessels revealed no evidence of carotid
     disease in the cervical bifurcation or intracranially.  Injection of the right
     internal carotid artery revealed the presence of a large anteriorly pointing
     middle cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysm measuring approximately 12 to 15
     mm in greatest diameter by 9 mm with a 6 to 7 mm neck.  There is a daughter
     aneurysm near the region of the neck which is probably of the rupture site. In
     addition, injection of the left internal carotid artery reveals the presence
     of a dominant left A1 segment in the anterior cerebral artery and an
     approximately 6 mm aneurysm with a daughter component which represents a high
     risk for subsequent rupture.  Injection of the bilateral subclavian arteries
     were within normal limits as were the vertebral arteries with no evidence of
     stenosis in the cervical segment or intracranially.  There is no evidence of
     posterior circulation aneurysm.  At this point, a decision was made to proceed
     with endovascular coil embolization using a two-stage approach.  The initial
     procedure centered treatment of the right middle cerebral artery aneurysm to
     that end.  The patient underwent placement of a 5 FR guide catheter into the
     right internal carotid artery.  Through that catheter a XL 10 microcatheter
     was guided over a microwire into the supraclinoid internal carotid artery
     across the intracranial bifurcation into the right middle cerebral artery and
     finally into the aneurysm.  With the microcatheter in this position and after
     obtaining a series of three-dimensional angiographic runs to obtain the best
     projection, a series of GDC coils were deployed into the aneurysm under
     constant surveillance.  These began with a GDC 10 3D 10 mm x 30 cm and
     continued for a total of 18 coils ending a GDC ultrasoft 2 [**12-18**] x 3 cm.  The
     last coil was not deployed because of herniation one of the middle cerebral
     artery branches and accordingly was removed.  Multiple surveillance mid
     embolization and post embolization three dimensional and biplane angiographic
     runs are performed which revealed no evidence of branch occlusion and showed
     good embolization of the aneurysm including the daughter aneurysm near the
     neck which was felt to be the rupture site.  At this point, the microcatheter
     was removed from the middle cerebral artery aneurysm and our attention was
     turned towards treatment of the left internal carotid artery approach leading
     to the anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  To that end, an SL 10
     microcatheter streamed shaped and the microwire was given a S-shaped and the
     microcatheter was navigated through the left internal carotid artery after
     placement of the guide catheter into the left internal carotid artery.  The
     microcatheter was guided into the left A1 segment of the anterior cerebral
     artery and then into the anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  With the
     microcath in this position, a series of GDC coils were deployed for a total of
     7 coils beginning with a GDC 3D 4 x 6 and ending a GDC 2 mm x 1 cm ultrasoft.
                                                                 (Over)

     A series of angiographic runs were performed including biplane runs which
     revealed no evidence of branch occlusion and near complete obliteration of the
     aneurysm with its coils.  At this point, biplane angiographic runs were
     performed of the left internal carotid artery to document the final result and
     the patient was transferred back to intensive care in stable condition.  There
     was no elevation of the intracranial pressure and the patient was administered
     a dose of intravenous heparin which was graded beginning with a very low dose
     and after deployment of a few coils into the right middle cerebral artery
     aneurysm was taken to an ACT closer to then greater than 200 seconds.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Ruptured right middle cerebral artery aneurysm and anterior
     communicating artery aneurysm treated via a right internal carotid artery and
     left internal carotid artery approaches respectively using microcatheter-based
     GDC coils.

     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Grade 5 subarachnoid hemorrhage.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same with a ruptured large right middle cerebral
     artery bifurcation aneurysm and an anterior communicating artery aneurysm with
     a daughter segment.  Status post coil embolization of the right middle
     cerebral artery via a right internal carotid artery microcatheter approach and
     status post coil embolization of the anterior communicating artery through a
     left internal carotid artery microcatheter based approach.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal anesthesia.
     
     INDICATION:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 2132**] is a 63 year old woman who had a high grade
     subarachnoid hemorrhage characterized by a right sylvian fissure clot.  After
     a period of a poorly reacting right pupil at the outside hospital, her pupils
     had since become equal and reactive and she is undergoing the cerebral
     angiogram in order to diagnose the source of the hemorrhage and also to
     provide endovascular treatment.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient's husband and her son were given a full and complete
     explanation of the procedure.  Specifically the indications, risks, benefits
     and alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail.  In addition the
     possible complications such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
     neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
     complications including the risk of coma and even death were outlined.  The
     patient's husband and her son understood and wished to proceed with the
     operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge single wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood a 5 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and kept
                                                                 (Over)

     on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     Right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, right subclavian
     artery, right vertebral artery, left common carotid artery, left internal
     carotid artery, left subclavian artery, and left vertebral artery.  At this
     point, evaluation of the patient's vessels revealed no evidence of carotid
     disease in the cervical bifurcation or intracranially.  Injection of the right
     internal carotid artery revealed the presence of a large anteriorly pointing
     middle cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysm measuring approximately 12 to 15
     mm in greatest diameter by 9 mm with a 6 to 7 mm neck.  There is a daughter
     aneurysm near the region of the neck which is probably of the rupture site. In
     addition, injection of the left internal carotid artery reveals the presence
     of a dominant left A1 segment in the anterior cerebral artery and an
     approximately 6 mm aneurysm with a daughter component which represents a high
     risk for subsequent rupture.  Injection of the bilateral subclavian arteries
     were within normal limits as were the vertebral arteries with no evidence of
     stenosis in the cervical segment or intracranially.  There is no evidence of
     posterior circulation aneurysm.  At this point, a decision was made to proceed
     with endovascular coil embolization using a two-stage approach.  The initial
     procedure centered treatment of the right middle cerebral artery aneurysm to
     that end.  The patient underwent placement of a 5 FR guide catheter into the
     right internal carotid artery.  Through that catheter a XL 10 microcatheter
     was guided over a microwire into the supraclinoid internal carotid artery
     across the intracranial bifurcation into the right middle cerebral artery and
     finally into the aneurysm.  With the microcatheter in this position and after
     obtaining a series of three-dimensional angiographic runs to obtain the best
     projection, a series of GDC coils were deployed into the aneurysm under
     constant surveillance.  These began with a GDC 10 3D 10 mm x 30 cm and
     continued for a total of 18 coils ending a GDC ultrasoft 2 [**12-18**] x 3 cm.  The
     last coil was not deployed because of herniation one of the middle cerebral
     artery branches and accordingly was removed.  Multiple surveillance mid
     embolization and post embolization three dimensional and biplane angiographic
     runs are performed which revealed no evidence of branch occlusion and showed
     good embolization of the aneurysm including the daughter aneurysm near the
     neck which was felt to be the rupture site.  At this point, the microcatheter
     was removed from the middle cerebral artery aneurysm and our attention was
     turned towards treatment of the left internal carotid artery approach leading
     to the anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  To that end, an SL 10
     microcatheter streamed shaped and the microwire was given a S-shaped and the
     microcatheter was navigated through the left internal carotid artery after
     placement of the guide catheter into the left internal carotid artery.  The
     microcatheter was guided into the left A1 segment of the anterior cerebral
     artery and then into the anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  With the
     microcath in this position, a series of GDC coils were deployed for a total of
     7 coils beginning with a GDC 3D 4 x 6 and ending a GDC 2 mm x 1 cm ultrasoft.

     INDICATION:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 2132**] is a 63 year old woman who had a high grade
     subarachnoid hemorrhage characterized by a right sylvian fissure clot.  After
     a period of a poorly reacting right pupil at the outside hospital, her pupils
     had since become equal and reactive and she is undergoing the cerebral
     angiogram in order to diagnose the source of the hemorrhage and also to
     provide endovascular treatment.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient's husband and her son were given a full and complete
     explanation of the procedure.  Specifically the indications, risks, benefits
     and alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail.  In addition the
     possible complications such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
     neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
     complications including the risk of coma and even death were outlined.  The
     patient's husband and her son understood and wished to proceed with the
     operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge single wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood a 5 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and kept
                                                                 (Over)

     on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     Right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, right subclavian
     artery, right vertebral artery, left common carotid artery, left internal
     carotid artery, left subclavian artery, and left vertebral artery.  At this
     point, evaluation of the patient's vessels revealed no evidence of carotid
     disease in the cervical bifurcation or intracranially.  Injection of the right
     internal carotid artery revealed the presence of a large anteriorly pointing
     middle cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysm measuring approximately 12 to 15
     mm in greatest diameter by 9 mm with a 6 to 7 mm neck.  There is a daughter
     aneurysm near the region of the neck which is probably of the rupture site. In
     addition, injection of the left internal carotid artery reveals the presence
     of a dominant left A1 segment in the anterior cerebral artery and an
     approximately 6 mm aneurysm with a daughter component which represents a high
     risk for subsequent rupture.  Injection of the bilateral subclavian arteries
     were within normal limits as were the vertebral arteries with no evidence of
     stenosis in the cervical segment or intracranially.  There is no evidence of
     posterior circulation aneurysm.  At this point, a decision was made to proceed
     with endovascular coil embolization using a two-stage approach.  The initial
     procedure centered treatment of the right middle cerebral artery aneurysm to
     that end.  The patient underwent placement of a 5 FR guide catheter into the
     right internal carotid artery.  Through that catheter a XL 10 microcatheter
     was guided over a microwire into the supraclinoid internal carotid artery
     across the intracranial bifurcation into the right middle cerebral artery and
     finally into the aneurysm.  With the microcatheter in this position and after
     obtaining a series of three-dimensional angiographic runs to obtain the best
     projection, a series of GDC coils were deployed into the aneurysm under
     constant surveillance.  These began with a GDC 10 3D 10 mm x 30 cm and
     continued for a total of 18 coils ending a GDC ultrasoft 2 [**12-18**] x 3 cm.  The
     last coil was not deployed because of herniation one of the middle cerebral
     artery branches and accordingly was removed.  Multiple surveillance mid
     embolization and post embolization three dimensional and biplane angiographic
     runs are performed which revealed no evidence of branch occlusion and showed
     good embolization of the aneurysm including the daughter aneurysm near the
     neck which was felt to be the rupture site.  At this point, the microcatheter
     was removed from the middle cerebral artery aneurysm and our attention was
     turned towards treatment of the left internal carotid artery approach leading
     to the anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  To that end, an SL 10
     microcatheter streamed shaped and the microwire was given a S-shaped and the
     microcatheter was navigated through the left internal carotid artery after
     placement of the guide catheter into the left internal carotid artery.  The
     microcatheter was guided into the left A1 segment of the anterior cerebral
     artery and then into the anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  With the
     microcath in this position, a series of GDC coils were deployed for a total of
     7 coils beginning with a GDC 3D 4 x 6 and ending a GDC 2 mm x 1 cm ultrasoft.
                                                                 (Over)

     A series of angiographic runs were performed including biplane runs which
     revealed no evidence of branch occlusion and near complete obliteration of the
     aneurysm with its coils.  At this point, biplane angiographic runs were
     performed of the left internal carotid artery to document the final result and
     the patient was transferred back to intensive care in stable condition.  There
     was no elevation of the intracranial pressure and the patient was administered
     a dose of intravenous heparin which was graded beginning with a very low dose
     and after deployment of a few coils into the right middle cerebral artery
     aneurysm was taken to an ACT closer to then greater than 200 seconds.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Ruptured right middle cerebral artery aneurysm and anterior
     communicating artery aneurysm treated via a right internal carotid artery and
     left internal carotid artery approaches respectively using microcatheter-based
     GDC coils.

     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Grade 5 subarachnoid hemorrhage.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same with a ruptured large right middle cerebral
     artery bifurcation aneurysm and an anterior communicating artery aneurysm with
     a daughter segment.  Status post coil embolization of the right middle
     cerebral artery via a right internal carotid artery microcatheter approach and
     status post coil embolization of the anterior communicating artery through a
     left internal carotid artery microcatheter based approach.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal anesthesia.
     
     INDICATION:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 2132**] is a 63 year old woman who had a high grade
     subarachnoid hemorrhage characterized by a right sylvian fissure clot.  After
     a period of a poorly reacting right pupil at the outside hospital, her pupils
     had since become equal and reactive and she is undergoing the cerebral
     angiogram in order to diagnose the source of the hemorrhage and also to
     provide endovascular treatment.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient's husband and her son were given a full and complete
     explanation of the procedure.  Specifically the indications, risks, benefits
     and alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail.  In addition the
     possible complications such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
     neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
     complications including the risk of coma and even death were outlined.  The
     patient's husband and her son understood and wished to proceed with the
     operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge single wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood a 5 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and kept
                                                                 (Over)

     on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     Right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, right subclavian
     artery, right vertebral artery, left common carotid artery, left internal
     carotid artery, left subclavian artery, and left vertebral artery.  At this
     point, evaluation of the patient's vessels revealed no evidence of carotid
     disease in the cervical bifurcation or intracranially.  Injection of the right
     internal carotid artery revealed the presence of a large anteriorly pointing
     middle cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysm measuring approximately 12 to 15
     mm in greatest diameter by 9 mm with a 6 to 7 mm neck.  There is a daughter
     aneurysm near the region of the neck which is probably of the rupture site. In
     addition, injection of the left internal carotid artery reveals the presence
     of a dominant left A1 segment in the anterior cerebral artery and an
     approximately 6 mm aneurysm with a daughter component which represents a high
     risk for subsequent rupture.  Injection of the bilateral subclavian arteries
     were within normal limits as were the vertebral arteries with no evidence of
     stenosis in the cervical segment or intracranially.  There is no evidence of
     posterior circulation aneurysm.  At this point, a decision was made to proceed
     with endovascular coil embolization using a two-stage approach.  The initial
     procedure centered treatment of the right middle cerebral artery aneurysm to
     that end.  The patient underwent placement of a 5 FR guide catheter into the
     right internal carotid artery.  Through that catheter a XL 10 microcatheter
     was guided over a microwire into the supraclinoid internal carotid artery
     across the intracranial bifurcation into the right middle cerebral artery and
     finally into the aneurysm.  With the microcatheter in this position and after
     obtaining a series of three-dimensional angiographic runs to obtain the best
     projection, a series of GDC coils were deployed into the aneurysm under
     constant surveillance.  These began with a GDC 10 3D 10 mm x 30 cm and
     continued for a total of 18 coils ending a GDC ultrasoft 2 [**12-18**] x 3 cm.  The
     last coil was not deployed because of herniation one of the middle cerebral
     artery branches and accordingly was removed.  Multiple surveillance mid
     embolization and post embolization three dimensional and biplane angiographic
     runs are performed which revealed no evidence of branch occlusion and showed
     good embolization of the aneurysm including the daughter aneurysm near the
     neck which was felt to be the rupture site.  At this point, the microcatheter
     was removed from the middle cerebral artery aneurysm and our attention was
     turned towards treatment of the left internal carotid artery approach leading
     to the anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  To that end, an SL 10
     microcatheter streamed shaped and the microwire was given a S-shaped and the
     microcatheter was navigated through the left internal carotid artery after
     placement of the guide catheter into the left internal carotid artery.  The
     microcatheter was guided into the left A1 segment of the anterior cerebral
     artery and then into the anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  With the

     INDICATION:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 2132**] is a 63 year old woman who had a high grade
     subarachnoid hemorrhage characterized by a right sylvian fissure clot.  After
     a period of a poorly reacting right pupil at the outside hospital, her pupils
     had since become equal and reactive and she is undergoing the cerebral
     angiogram in order to diagnose the source of the hemorrhage and also to
     provide endovascular treatment.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient's husband and her son were given a full and complete
     explanation of the procedure.  Specifically the indications, risks, benefits
     and alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail.  In addition the
     possible complications such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,

     complications including the risk of coma and even death were outlined.  The
     patient's husband and her son understood and wished to proceed with the
     operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge single wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood a 5 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and kept

     on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     Right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, right subclavian
     artery, right vertebral artery, left common carotid artery, left internal
     carotid artery, left subclavian artery, and left vertebral artery.  At this
     point, evaluation of the patient's vessels revealed no evidence of carotid
     disease in the cervical bifurcation or intracranially.  Injection of the right
     internal carotid artery revealed the presence of a large anteriorly pointing
     middle cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysm measuring approximately 12 to 15
     mm in greatest diameter by 9 mm with a 6 to 7 mm neck.  There is a daughter
     aneurysm near the region of the neck which is probably of the rupture site. In
     addition, injection of the left internal carotid artery reveals the presence
     of a dominant left A1 segment in the anterior cerebral artery and an
     approximately 6 mm aneurysm with a daughter component which represents a high
     risk for subsequent rupture.  Injection of the bilateral subclavian arteries
     were within normal limits as were the vertebral arteries with no evidence of
     stenosis in the cervical segment or intracranially.  There is no evidence of
     posterior circulation aneurysm.  At this point, a decision was made to proceed
     with endovascular coil embolization using a two-stage approach.  The initial
     procedure centered treatment of the right middle cerebral artery aneurysm to
     that end.  The patient underwent placement of a 5 FR guide catheter into the
     right internal carotid artery.  Through that catheter a XL 10 microcatheter
     was guided over a microwire into the supraclinoid internal carotid artery
     across the intracranial bifurcation into the right middle cerebral artery and
     finally into the aneurysm.  With the microcatheter in this position and after
     obtaining a series of three-dimensional angiographic runs to obtain the best
     projection, a series of GDC coils were deployed into the aneurysm under
     constant surveillance.  These began with a GDC 10 3D 10 mm x 30 cm and
     continued for a total of 18 coils ending a GDC ultrasoft 2 [**12-18**] x 3 cm.  The
     last coil was not deployed because of herniation one of the middle cerebral
     artery branches and accordingly was removed.  Multiple surveillance mid
     embolization and post embolization three dimensional and biplane angiographic
     runs are performed which revealed no evidence of branch occlusion and showed
     good embolization of the aneurysm including the daughter aneurysm near the
     neck which was felt to be the rupture site.  At this point, the microcatheter
     was removed from the middle cerebral artery aneurysm and our attention was
     turned towards treatment of the left internal carotid artery approach leading
     to the anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  To that end, an SL 10
     microcatheter streamed shaped and the microwire was given a S-shaped and the
     microcatheter was navigated through the left internal carotid artery after
     placement of the guide catheter into the left internal carotid artery.  The
     microcatheter was guided into the left A1 segment of the anterior cerebral
     artery and then into the anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  With the
     microcath in this position, a series of GDC coils were deployed for a total of
     7 coils beginning with a GDC 3D 4 x 6 and ending a GDC 2 mm x 1 cm ultrasoft.
                                                                 (Over)

     A series of angiographic runs were performed including biplane runs which
     revealed no evidence of branch occlusion and near complete obliteration of the
     aneurysm with its coils.  At this point, biplane angiographic runs were
     performed of the left internal carotid artery to document the final result and
     the patient was transferred back to intensive care in stable condition.  There
     was no elevation of the intracranial pressure and the patient was administered
     a dose of intravenous heparin which was graded beginning with a very low dose
     and after deployment of a few coils into the right middle cerebral artery
     aneurysm was taken to an ACT closer to then greater than 200 seconds.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Ruptured right middle cerebral artery aneurysm and anterior
     communicating artery aneurysm treated via a right internal carotid artery and
     left internal carotid artery approaches respectively using microcatheter-based
     GDC coils.

     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Grade 5 subarachnoid hemorrhage.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same with a ruptured large right middle cerebral
     artery bifurcation aneurysm and an anterior communicating artery aneurysm with
     a daughter segment.  Status post coil embolization of the right middle
     cerebral artery via a right internal carotid artery microcatheter approach and
     status post coil embolization of the anterior communicating artery through a
     left internal carotid artery microcatheter based approach.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal anesthesia.
     
     INDICATION:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 2132**] is a 63 year old woman who had a high grade
     subarachnoid hemorrhage characterized by a right sylvian fissure clot.  After
     a period of a poorly reacting right pupil at the outside hospital, her pupils
     had since become equal and reactive and she is undergoing the cerebral
     angiogram in order to diagnose the source of the hemorrhage and also to
     provide endovascular treatment.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient's husband and her son were given a full and complete
     explanation of the procedure.  Specifically the indications, risks, benefits
     and alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail.  In addition the
     possible complications such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
     neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
     complications including the risk of coma and even death were outlined.  The
     patient's husband and her son understood and wished to proceed with the
     operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge single wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood a 5 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and kept
                                                                 (Over)

     on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     Right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, right subclavian
     artery, right vertebral artery, left common carotid artery, left internal
     carotid artery, left subclavian artery, and left vertebral artery.  At this
     point, evaluation of the patient's vessels revealed no evidence of carotid
     disease in the cervical bifurcation or intracranially.  Injection of the right
     internal carotid artery revealed the presence of a large anteriorly pointing
     middle cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysm measuring approximately 12 to 15
     mm in greatest diameter by 9 mm with a 6 to 7 mm neck.  There is a daughter
     aneurysm near the region of the neck which is probably of the rupture site. In
     addition, injection of the left internal carotid artery reveals the presence
     of a dominant left A1 segment in the anterior cerebral artery and an
     approximately 6 mm aneurysm with a daughter component which represents a high
     risk for subsequent rupture.  Injection of the bilateral subclavian arteries
     were within normal limits as were the vertebral arteries with no evidence of
     stenosis in the cervical segment or intracranially.  There is no evidence of
     posterior circulation aneurysm.  At this point, a decision was made to proceed
     with endovascular coil embolization using a two-stage approach.  The initial
     procedure centered treatment of the right middle cerebral artery aneurysm to
     that end.  The patient underwent placement of a 5 FR guide catheter into the
     right internal carotid artery.  Through that catheter a XL 10 microcatheter
     was guided over a microwire into the supraclinoid internal carotid artery
     across the intracranial bifurcation into the right middle cerebral artery and
     finally into the aneurysm.  With the microcatheter in this position and after
     obtaining a series of three-dimensional angiographic runs to obtain the best
     projection, a series of GDC coils were deployed into the aneurysm under
     constant surveillance.  These began with a GDC 10 3D 10 mm x 30 cm and
     continued for a total of 18 coils ending a GDC ultrasoft 2 [**12-18**] x 3 cm.  The
     last coil was not deployed because of herniation one of the middle cerebral
     artery branches and accordingly was removed.  Multiple surveillance mid
     embolization and post embolization three dimensional and biplane angiographic
     runs are performed which revealed no evidence of branch occlusion and showed
     good embolization of the aneurysm including the daughter aneurysm near the
     neck which was felt to be the rupture site.  At this point, the microcatheter
     was removed from the middle cerebral artery aneurysm and our attention was
     turned towards treatment of the left internal carotid artery approach leading
     to the anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  To that end, an SL 10
     microcatheter streamed shaped and the microwire was given a S-shaped and the

     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Grade 5 subarachnoid hemorrhage.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same with a ruptured large right middle cerebral
     artery bifurcation aneurysm and an anterior communicating artery aneurysm with
     a daughter segment.  Status post coil embolization of the right middle
     cerebral artery via a right internal carotid artery microcatheter approach and
     status post coil embolization of the anterior communicating artery through a
     left internal carotid artery microcatheter based approach.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal anesthesia.
     
     INDICATION:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 2132**] is a 63 year old woman who had a high grade
     subarachnoid hemorrhage characterized by a right sylvian fissure clot.  After
     a period of a poorly reacting right pupil at the outside hospital, her pupils
     had since become equal and reactive and she is undergoing the cerebral
     angiogram in order to diagnose the source of the hemorrhage and also to
     provide endovascular treatment.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient's husband and her son were given a full and complete
     explanation of the procedure.  Specifically the indications, risks, benefits
     and alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail.  In addition the
     possible complications such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
     neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
     complications including the risk of coma and even death were outlined.  The
     patient's husband and her son understood and wished to proceed with the
     operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge single wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood a 5 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and kept
                                                                 (Over)

     on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     Right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, right subclavian
     artery, right vertebral artery, left common carotid artery, left internal
     carotid artery, left subclavian artery, and left vertebral artery.  At this
     point, evaluation of the patient's vessels revealed no evidence of carotid
     disease in the cervical bifurcation or intracranially.  Injection of the right
     internal carotid artery revealed the presence of a large anteriorly pointing
     middle cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysm measuring approximately 12 to 15
     mm in greatest diameter by 9 mm with a 6 to 7 mm neck.  There is a daughter
     aneurysm near the region of the neck which is probably of the rupture site. In
     addition, injection of the left internal carotid artery reveals the presence
     of a dominant left A1 segment in the anterior cerebral artery and an
     approximately 6 mm aneurysm with a daughter component which represents a high
     risk for subsequent rupture.  Injection of the bilateral subclavian arteries
     were within normal limits as were the vertebral arteries with no evidence of
     stenosis in the cervical segment or intracranially.  There is no evidence of
     posterior circulation aneurysm.  At this point, a decision was made to proceed
     with endovascular coil embolization using a two-stage approach.  The initial
     procedure centered treatment of the right middle cerebral artery aneurysm to
     that end.  The patient underwent placement of a 5 FR guide catheter into the
     right internal carotid artery.  Through that catheter a XL 10 microcatheter
     was guided over a microwire into the supraclinoid internal carotid artery
     across the intracranial bifurcation into the right middle cerebral artery and
     finally into the aneurysm.  With the microcatheter in this position and after
     obtaining a series of three-dimensional angiographic runs to obtain the best
     projection, a series of GDC coils were deployed into the aneurysm under
     constant surveillance.  These began with a GDC 10 3D 10 mm x 30 cm and
     continued for a total of 18 coils ending a GDC ultrasoft 2 [**12-18**] x 3 cm.  The
     last coil was not deployed because of herniation one of the middle cerebral
     artery branches and accordingly was removed.  Multiple surveillance mid
     embolization and post embolization three dimensional and biplane angiographic
     runs are performed which revealed no evidence of branch occlusion and showed
     good embolization of the aneurysm including the daughter aneurysm near the
     neck which was felt to be the rupture site.  At this point, the microcatheter
     was removed from the middle cerebral artery aneurysm and our attention was
     turned towards treatment of the left internal carotid artery approach leading
     to the anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  To that end, an SL 10
     microcatheter streamed shaped and the microwire was given a S-shaped and the
     microcatheter was navigated through the left internal carotid artery after
     placement of the guide catheter into the left internal carotid artery.  The
     microcatheter was guided into the left A1 segment of the anterior cerebral
     artery and then into the anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  With the
     microcath in this position, a series of GDC coils were deployed for a total of
     7 coils beginning with a GDC 3D 4 x 6 and ending a GDC 2 mm x 1 cm ultrasoft.
                                                                 (Over)

     A series of angiographic runs were performed including biplane runs which
     revealed no evidence of branch occlusion and near complete obliteration of the
     aneurysm with its coils.  At this point, biplane angiographic runs were
     performed of the left internal carotid artery to document the final result and
     the patient was transferred back to intensive care in stable condition.  There
     was no elevation of the intracranial pressure and the patient was administered
     a dose of intravenous heparin which was graded beginning with a very low dose
     and after deployment of a few coils into the right middle cerebral artery
     aneurysm was taken to an ACT closer to then greater than 200 seconds.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Ruptured right middle cerebral artery aneurysm and anterior
     communicating artery aneurysm treated via a right internal carotid artery and
     left internal carotid artery approaches respectively using microcatheter-based
     GDC coils.

     on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     Right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, right subclavian
     artery, right vertebral artery, left common carotid artery, left internal
     carotid artery, left subclavian artery, and left vertebral artery.  At this
     point, evaluation of the patient's vessels revealed no evidence of carotid
     disease in the cervical bifurcation or intracranially.  Injection of the right
     internal carotid artery revealed the presence of a large anteriorly pointing
     middle cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysm measuring approximately 12 to 15
     mm in greatest diameter by 9 mm with a 6 to 7 mm neck.  There is a daughter
     aneurysm near the region of the neck which is probably of the rupture site. In
     addition, injection of the left internal carotid artery reveals the presence
     of a dominant left A1 segment in the anterior cerebral artery and an
     approximately 6 mm aneurysm with a daughter component which represents a high
     risk for subsequent rupture.  Injection of the bilateral subclavian arteries
     were within normal limits as were the vertebral arteries with no evidence of
     stenosis in the cervical segment or intracranially.  There is no evidence of
     posterior circulation aneurysm.  At this point, a decision was made to proceed
     with endovascular coil embolization using a two-stage approach.  The initial
     procedure centered treatment of the right middle cerebral artery aneurysm to
     that end.  The patient underwent placement of a 5 FR guide catheter into the
     right internal carotid artery.  Through that catheter a XL 10 microcatheter
     was guided over a microwire into the supraclinoid internal carotid artery
     across the intracranial bifurcation into the right middle cerebral artery and
     finally into the aneurysm.  With the microcatheter in this position and after
     obtaining a series of three-dimensional angiographic runs to obtain the best
     projection, a series of GDC coils were deployed into the aneurysm under
     constant surveillance.  These began with a GDC 10 3D 10 mm x 30 cm and
     continued for a total of 18 coils ending a GDC ultrasoft 2 [**12-18**] x 3 cm.  The
     last coil was not deployed because of herniation one of the middle cerebral
     artery branches and accordingly was removed.  Multiple surveillance mid
     embolization and post embolization three dimensional and biplane angiographic
     runs are performed which revealed no evidence of branch occlusion and showed
     good embolization of the aneurysm including the daughter aneurysm near the
     neck which was felt to be the rupture site.  At this point, the microcatheter
     was removed from the middle cerebral artery aneurysm and our attention was
     turned towards treatment of the left internal carotid artery approach leading
     to the anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  To that end, an SL 10
     microcatheter streamed shaped and the microwire was given a S-shaped and the
     microcatheter was navigated through the left internal carotid artery after
     placement of the guide catheter into the left internal carotid artery.  The
     microcatheter was guided into the left A1 segment of the anterior cerebral
     artery and then into the anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  With the
     microcath in this position, a series of GDC coils were deployed for a total of
     7 coils beginning with a GDC 3D 4 x 6 and ending a GDC 2 mm x 1 cm ultrasoft.

     INDICATION:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 2132**] is a 63 year old woman who had a high grade
     subarachnoid hemorrhage characterized by a right sylvian fissure clot.  After
     a period of a poorly reacting right pupil at the outside hospital, her pupils
     had since become equal and reactive and she is undergoing the cerebral
     angiogram in order to diagnose the source of the hemorrhage and also to
     provide endovascular treatment.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient's husband and her son were given a full and complete
     explanation of the procedure.  Specifically the indications, risks, benefits
     and alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail.  In addition the
     possible complications such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
     neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
     complications including the risk of coma and even death were outlined.  The
     patient's husband and her son understood and wished to proceed with the
     operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge single wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk

     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Grade 5 subarachnoid hemorrhage.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same with a ruptured large right middle cerebral
     artery bifurcation aneurysm and an anterior communicating artery aneurysm with
     a daughter segment.  Status post coil embolization of the right middle
     cerebral artery via a right internal carotid artery microcatheter approach and
     status post coil embolization of the anterior communicating artery through a
     left internal carotid artery microcatheter based approach.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal anesthesia.
     
     INDICATION:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 2132**] is a 63 year old woman who had a high grade
     subarachnoid hemorrhage characterized by a right sylvian fissure clot.  After
     a period of a poorly reacting right pupil at the outside hospital, her pupils
     had since become equal and reactive and she is undergoing the cerebral
     angiogram in order to diagnose the source of the hemorrhage and also to
     provide endovascular treatment.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient's husband and her son were given a full and complete
     explanation of the procedure.  Specifically the indications, risks, benefits
     and alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail.  In addition the
     possible complications such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
     neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
     complications including the risk of coma and even death were outlined.  The
     patient's husband and her son understood and wished to proceed with the
     operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge single wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood a 5 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and kept
                                                                 (Over)

     on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     Right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, right subclavian
     artery, right vertebral artery, left common carotid artery, left internal
     carotid artery, left subclavian artery, and left vertebral artery.  At this
     point, evaluation of the patient's vessels revealed no evidence of carotid
     disease in the cervical bifurcation or intracranially.  Injection of the right
     internal carotid artery revealed the presence of a large anteriorly pointing
     middle cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysm measuring approximately 12 to 15
     mm in greatest diameter by 9 mm with a 6 to 7 mm neck.  There is a daughter
     aneurysm near the region of the neck which is probably of the rupture site. In
     addition, injection of the left internal carotid artery reveals the presence
     of a dominant left A1 segment in the anterior cerebral artery and an
     approximately 6 mm aneurysm with a daughter component which represents a high
     risk for subsequent rupture.  Injection of the bilateral subclavian arteries
     were within normal limits as were the vertebral arteries with no evidence of
     stenosis in the cervical segment or intracranially.  There is no evidence of
     posterior circulation aneurysm.  At this point, a decision was made to proceed
     with endovascular coil embolization using a two-stage approach.  The initial
     procedure centered treatment of the right middle cerebral artery aneurysm to
     that end.  The patient underwent placement of a 5 FR guide catheter into the
     right internal carotid artery.  Through that catheter a XL 10 microcatheter
     was guided over a microwire into the supraclinoid internal carotid artery
     across the intracranial bifurcation into the right middle cerebral artery and
     finally into the aneurysm.  With the microcatheter in this position and after
     obtaining a series of three-dimensional angiographic runs to obtain the best
     projection, a series of GDC coils were deployed into the aneurysm under
     constant surveillance.  These began with a GDC 10 3D 10 mm x 30 cm and
     continued for a total of 18 coils ending a GDC ultrasoft 2 [**12-18**] x 3 cm.  The
     last coil was not deployed because of herniation one of the middle cerebral
     artery branches and accordingly was removed.  Multiple surveillance mid
     embolization and post embolization three dimensional and biplane angiographic
     runs are performed which revealed no evidence of branch occlusion and showed
     good embolization of the aneurysm including the daughter aneurysm near the
     neck which was felt to be the rupture site.  At this point, the microcatheter
     was removed from the middle cerebral artery aneurysm and our attention was
     turned towards treatment of the left internal carotid artery approach leading
     to the anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  To that end, an SL 10
     microcatheter streamed shaped and the microwire was given a S-shaped and the
     microcatheter was navigated through the left internal carotid artery after
     placement of the guide catheter into the left internal carotid artery.  The
     microcatheter was guided into the left A1 segment of the anterior cerebral
     artery and then into the anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  With the
     microcath in this position, a series of GDC coils were deployed for a total of
     7 coils beginning with a GDC 3D 4 x 6 and ending a GDC 2 mm x 1 cm ultrasoft.
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  Transferred from outside hospital with a subarachnoid hemorrhage,
     assess for interval changes.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Routine noncontrast head CT.
     
     Comparison is made to a CT from an outside institution done several hours
     earlier.
     
     FINDINGS:  There has been no significant change from the prior, outside study.
     There is very extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage.  There is a large
     right intrasylvian and intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right frontoparietal
     temporal region, measuring 5 X 3.5 cm.  There is also miniscule  subdural
     hemorrhage along the right cerebral convexity as well as along the falx
     cerebri.  There is significant mass effect upon the adjacent structures,
     including flattening of the right lateral ventricle.  There is no significant
     dilatation of the left lateral ventricle.  There is shift of normally midline
     structures towards the left, not significantly changed in extent.  There is
     mild-moderate effacement of the basilar cisterns.  The visualized osseous
     structures and paranasal sinuses are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Extensive intracranial hemorrhage as described above with mass
     effect and shift of midline structures to the left, consistent with
     uncal/hippocampal herniation. There has been no significant change from the
     prior outside CT done several hours earlier.
     
     
     CONMENT: A cluster of calcifications is noted in the right sylvian cistern,
     likely representing atherosclerotic calcification in a right middle cerebral
     artery aneursym, presumably the source of the subarachnoid hemorrhage.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
        62 year old female transferred from OSH with SAH need to see interval changes 
         
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      check interval change following SAH                                             
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Follow up subarachnoid hemorrhage.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial non-contrast CT scans of the brain were obtained.
     
     Comparison is made to the previous CT of [**2832-6-23**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     In the interval since the previous exam, a right middle cerebral arterial
     territory aneurysm has been coiled.  Metallic artifact limits evaluation of
     the right inferior frontal and temporal lobes.  There has also been a right
     frontoparietal craniectomy and placement of a left frontal ventricular
     catheter.  A drain is seen along the surface of the right frontal and temporal
     brain, which is expanded through the craniectomy defect.  This has reduced
     intracranial shift, and the midline structures are in near normal alignment.
     The ventricles are not dilated.  The left frontal ventricular catheter extends
     through the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 67**] and terminates near the foramen of [**Last Name (un) **].
     
     There continues to be subarachnoid hemorrhage, most notably within the right
     Sylvian fissure.  Some of the Sylvian hematoma has been evacuated, and a
     small amount of residual air is seen in this location.
     
     There is poor [**Doctor Last Name 63**]-white matter differentiation of the right frontal lobe,
     and also the right temporal lobe. Additionally, there is a focal region of
     decreased attenuation involving the medial right occipital and/or
     posteromedial parietal lobe, probably indicating an acute infarction in the
     distribution of the right posterior cerebral artery.
     
     There has been no additional hemorrhage in the interval since the previous
     study.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Right middle cerebral arterial aneurysm has been coiled, and
     there has been interval right frontotemporal decompression through a
     craniectomy.
     
     The ventricles are not dilated.
     
     Parenchymal attenuation is difficult to assess, but the right frontal and
     temporal lobes show signs of edema. There is a new small right medial
     occipital or posterior parietal infarction.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     catheter terminates in the superior vena cava.  Note is made of kinking of the
     right subclavian IV catheter at the insertion.  No pneumothorax is identified.
     
     There is increased bilateral patchy opacities which most likely represent
     pulmonary edema.  Superimposed aspiration pneumonia is also a consideration.

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     HISTORY: 62-year-old woman less responsive after subarachnoid hemorrhage and
     aneurysm coiling.
     
     Contiguous 5 mm images were obtained through the brain. No contrast was
     administered. Comparison is made to a head CT performed on [**2832-6-24**].
     
     FINDINGS: There is continued evolution of the right posterior cerebral artery
     infarct since the prior examination. The ventricles are smaller overall than
     on the earlier study. A ventricular catheter enters the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 67**] and
     its tip is in the third ventricle. There is no evidence of new hemorrhage.
     
     There is a large right frontal, parietal, and temporal hematoma, with
     surrounding low density representing a combination of edema and extruded
     serum. The low density has increased in volume since [**6-24**], but there have been
     no other changes.
     
     There has been a right frontal and temporal craniectomy with brain herniating
     out of the craniectomy defect. This is unchanged.
     
     There has been depostion of two sets of coils, one in the middle cranial
     fossa, and one in the midline. Their positions have not changed. These produce
     extensive artifact that obscures images of teh uppen pons and midbrain. THre
     is probable hypodensity of the pons, suggesting infarction. If this is a
     clinical concern, correllation with a brain MR study may be indicated.
     
     Conclusion: Possible pontine and midbrain infarction as discussed above. THis
     area is obscured by artifact arising from the coils. A brain MR may be
     helpful.
     
     There are no other changes in this patient status post coiling of aneurysms,
     craniectomy, with brain herniating out the craniectomy defect, and small right
     posterior cerebral artery infarction.

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     NONCONTRAST CT OF THE BRAIN.
     
     INDICATION:  62 year old female with progression of bleed after subarachnoid
     hemorrhage.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging of the brain performed without IV contrast.  Comparison
     is made to a prior study performed three days previously.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is again demonstrated a right posterior cerebral artery
     distribution infarct which appears stable when compared to the prior
     examination.  The ventricle size is unchanged.  There is a left-sided
     ventricular drainage catheter in place which passes through the left frontal
     [**Doctor Last Name 67**] of the lateral ventricle and ends with its distal tip in the region of
     the third ventricle.  There is no evidence of new hemorrhage.  There is an
     unchanged appearance of subarachnoid hemorrhage with large right frontal and
     parietal and temporal region hematoma with an extensive right frontal and
     temporal craniotomy defect.  There is evidence of herniation of brain out of
     the craniotomy defect which appears slightly more prominent when compared to
     the prior examination.  There are two aneurysm coils which are in stable
     position and cause extensive streak artifact obscuring the visualization of
     the midbrain and right temporal region.  Visualization of the pons and
     midbrain is obscured by extensive streak artifact.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Slightly increased prominence of the patient's brain herniation
     through the craniotomy defect.  Otherwise stable examination with small right
     posterior cerebral artery infarct, stable intraparenchymal and subarachnoid
     hemorrhage, and no other changes in this patient status post coiling of
     aneurysms.  The previously described areas of hypodensity within the pons are
     again seen and partially obscured by extensive streak artifact.

Review of Systems:

Neuro: Deeply sedated on propofol at 80mcg/kg/min and paralyzed with Cisatracurium. Titrating throughout shift. TOF [**3-19**] most of the day. Just decreased dose to 0.1mg/kg/hr. Absent cough, gag and corneal reflexes. PERL 2mm and briskly reactive. No movement of extremities noted, even prior to start of paralytic med. Vent drain in place with very poor waveform. Flushed by neurosurg multiple times throughout the day. No drainage. ICP 2-30 (question accuracy of numbers, waveform is completely flat). Neurosurg aware that this is an ongoing problem. Drainage noted around the insertion site this afternoon and dressing changed x 1. Saturated again. Crani incision with staples intact. Clean and dry with no drainage. New DSD in place. CT scan today: some worsening bleeding. Nimodipine and Dilantin.

CV: SR with occasional PACs. PACs are more frequent at times and then pt went into Afib/flutter x 2 today. Medicated with Lopressor 5mg IV with good effect.

     NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN.
     
     HISTORY:  Known intracranial hemorrhage.  Follow-up study.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial non-contrast head CT scan was obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is continued evidence for the presence of multiple
     intracranial hemorrhages, including persistence of the hemorrhage that is
     situated along the tract of the ventricular drainage catheter.  Overall, there
     is perhaps very slight increase in the quantity of hemorrhage within the
     occipital horns.  Far more extensive parenchymal hemorrhages appear stable.
     There are no new areas of infarction identified.  The ventricular size is also
     stable.
     
     CONCLUSION:  At most, slight increase in the amount of intraventricular
     hemorrhage.  No other overt interval changes detected.

     CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST.
     
     HISTORY:  62 year old woman with subarachnoid hemorrhage status post
     craniectomy with respiratory compromise.
     
     Contiguous 5-mm axial images were obtained through the brain.  No contrast was
     administered.  Comparison is made to a head CT performed on [**2832-7-1**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Images of the brain appear unchanged.  Again noted is a large right
     frontal and temporal lobe hematoma with extensive surrounding edema.  There
     has been a right frontal and temporal craniectomy and brain herniates through
     the craniectomy defect.  Again noted is left frontal lobe hemorrhage and edema
     surrounding a ventricular catheter tract.  Again noted is hemorrhage within
     the right posterior cerebral artery distribution infarction.  A small amount
     of subarachnoid hemorrhage is present in the right anterior parietal lobe,
     unchanged.  There is a small amount of blood in the lateral ventricles
     bilaterally, with no evidence of new hemorrhage since the prior CT scan. Again
     noted are aneurysm coils in the expected locations of middle cerebral artery
     and anterior communicating artery aneurysms.  Again noted is a small right
     medial temporal hematoma.
     
     There is partial opacification of the maxillary sinuses bilaterally with a
     slight increase in the volume of fluid in the left maxillary sinus.  The
     ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses also are largely opacified.
     
     CONCLUSION:  No significant change since [**2832-7-1**].  Massive right frontal and
     temporal hematoma with surrounding edema, mass effect, and herniation of the
     brain through the craniectomy defect.  Hemorrhage along the left frontal
     catheter tract.  Hemorrhage in the right posterior cerebral artery
     distribution infarction.  Right medial temporal hemorrhage.

     placed on table in supine position.  The groins were prepped and draped in the
     usual sterile fashion.  A single needle was used and the right common femoral
     artery was punctured.  A 4 FR vascular sheath was placed.  Through the sheath
     a 4 FR Berenstein catheter was placed and the following arteries are
     selectively catheterized.
     
     Right common carotid artery.
     
     Right internal carotid artery.
     
     Left common carotid artery.
     
     Left internal carotid artery.
     
     Left vertebral artery.
     
     These arteries are catheterized over a wire and using roadmapping techniques.
     
     After the evaluation the angiograms, the catheter was withdrawn and pressure
     washold on the groin,_ until hemostasis was obtained.  The patient was sent to
     the floor with orders.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     Evaluation of the common carotid arteries o both sides demonstrates no
     significant stenosis.
     
     RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:
     
     Evaluation of the right internal carotid artery angiogram demonstrates
     opacification of the right anterior and middle cerebral artery branches.  No
     definite vasospasm noted.

     patient is here for follow up angiogram to exclude vasospasm.
     
     Informed consent was obtained from patient and the patient's family after
     explaining the risks, benefits, and alternative details in extreme detail.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought into the neurointerventional suite and
     placed on table in supine position.  The groins were prepped and draped in the
     usual sterile fashion.  A single needle was used and the right common femoral
     artery was punctured.  A 4 FR vascular sheath was placed.  Through the sheath
     a 4 FR Berenstein catheter was placed and the following arteries are
     selectively catheterized.
     
     Right common carotid artery.
     
     Right internal carotid artery.
     
     Left common carotid artery.
     
     Left internal carotid artery.
     
     Left vertebral artery.
     
     These arteries are catheterized over a wire and using roadmapping techniques.
     
     After the evaluation the angiograms, the catheter was withdrawn and pressure
     washold on the groin,_ until hemostasis was obtained.  The patient was sent to
     the floor with orders.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     Evaluation of the common carotid arteries o both sides demonstrates no
     significant stenosis.
     
     RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:
     
     Evaluation of the right internal carotid artery angiogram demonstrates
     opacification of the right anterior and middle cerebral artery branches.  No
     definite vasospasm noted.
                                                                 (Over)

     LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:
     
     Evaluation of the distal left internal carotid artery demonstrates good
     opaification of the left anterior and middle cerebral artery branches.  No
     significant vasopasm noted.
     
     The previously coiled aneurysms demonstrates no definite residual aneurysms.
     
     LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY:
     
     Evaluation of the left vertebral artery demonstrates good opacification of the
     distal left vertebral artery, distal basilar artery, posterior cerebral
     arteries on both sides.  There is minimal reflux into the distal right
     vertebral artery noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  No significant vasospasm noted.
     
     2.  No definite residual  aneurysm noted in the previously coiled right middle
     cerebral artery and anterior communicating artery aneurysm.
     
     These findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 726**], the referring surgeon,
     immediately after the examination.

     COMPARISONS: [**2832-6-30**] radiograph.
     
     A right subclavian vascular catheter terminates in the superior vena cava.
     However, note is made of slight redundancy and apparent coiling of the
     catheter near the skin insertion site.  Endotracheal tube and NG tube are in
     satisfactory position. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to
     assess due to marked rotation of the patient.  There are multifocal patchy
     parenchymal opacities in both mid and lower lung zones with interval
     progression and opacity in the left retrocardiac region.  There are also
     small pleural effusions bilaterally.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Vascular catheter terminates in superior vena cava but there is redundancy
     and apparent coiling of the catheter near the skin insertion site as
     described.
     2) Multifocal patchy parenchymal opacities in the mid and lower lung zones
     which may be due to previously provided history of ARDS.  A superimposed acute
     process in the left retrocardiac region is likely.  This could be due to
     atelectasis or pneumonia.  Repeat non-rotated chest radiograph would be
     helpful to better assess for the presence of volume loss in the left lower
     lobe.

     CLINICAL INDICATION: Worsening congestive heart failure symptoms.
     
     Lines and tubes are stable in position compared to previous study.  Again
     noted is the tortuous course of the right subclavian catheter near the skin
     insertion site.  It is uncertain if the tortuosity is proximal or distal to
     the insertion site.  The patient is rotated towards the left but there appears
     to be some volume loss in the left hemithorax nonetheless.  There is abrupt
     cutoff of the left main stem bronchus and dense opacity in the left
     retropcardiac region.  Multifocal alveolar opacities in both lungs appear
     stable.  A small right and moderate left pleural effusion are unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Left lower lobe collapse, likely due to central mucous plugging considering
     associated abrupt cutoff of left main stem bronchus.
     
     2) Multifocal alveolar opacities are unchanged and may relate to multifocal
     pneumonia, asymmetric edema or ARDS.

Family was made aware that they will need to make certain decisions early on this week as pt is heading towards needing a trach and peg. All this explained to family by MD [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2443**] by this RN. Pt's son verbalized, ""I knew this conversation was coming; I am not stupid and have been reading between the lines all week."" Offering extensive supportive care for family. Pt's husband verbalized being tired and his leg is still bothering him. He has a cardiology apt tomorrow am and may be in to visit afterwards, otherwise he will come with his son at night. For family members, the son and the husband are the primary decision makers. The patient has family (sisters) in [**State 109**] who are waiting for a call from Mr. [**Known patient lastname 5072**].

Plan: Continue to search for source of infection. ABX as ordered. Needs to have BM. Restart tube feeds.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
           62 year old female transferred from OSH with SAH                           
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      interval changes

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     HISTORY: Assess for interval changes with known intracranial hemorrhage.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT scan.
     
     FINDINGS: Comparison with the prior study of [**2832-7-2**] reveals diminished
     density of the multiple intracranial hemorrhages described in detail on the
     prior reports. However, the extensive swelling of the right frontal lobe, with
     its herniation through the craniotomy defect remains unaltered in extent.
     There are no new areas of hemorrhage identified. Ventricular system has not
     changed in its configuration. There is no shift of normally midline
     structures. There is continued evidence for moderate bilateral ethmoid and
     prominent sphenoid sinus opacification, likely due to a combination of mucosal
     thickening and fluid, with fluid particularly likely in the sphenoid sinus.
     The sinus abnormality presumably related to intubation, as is mild left and
     moderate right sided mastoid sinus opacification. Finally, there is re-
     demonstration of extensive artifact arising from multiple intracranial
     surgical clips, again described in detail on previous studies.
     
     CONCLUSION: Minimal change from prior study,  as described above.

     Comparison is made to study of [**2832-7-3**] at 13:28.
     
     FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is seen with tip just above the carina.  The
     lung volumes are low.  There are woesening bibasilar air space opacities, left
     worse than right.  There is no pneumothorax.  A right-sided subclavian central
     venous line is unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Intubation without pneumothorax.  Decreased lung volumes may
     explain worsening lung opacities.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     AP BEDSIDE CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
     
     INDICATION:  62 year old female with subarachnoid hemorrhage on ventilator
     with fever.  Evaluate for worsening infiltrates.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to a prior study from [**2832-7-6**].
     
     There is an endotracheal tube approximately 4 cm above the carina.  There is a
     right-sided subclavian central venous line with its distal tip in the mid SVC.
      The proximal portion of this right subclavian central venous line appears
     kinked.  The heart size and mediastinal contours are stable when compared to
     the prior examination.  There is an NG tube in position with its distal tip in
     the proximal stomach near the gastroesophageal junction.  There is no evidence
     of pneumothorax.  There are probable small bilateral pleural effusions.  There
     are multifocal areas of patchy pulmonary parenchymal opacity which are most
     prominent within the left lung base and the peripheral right lung base.  There
     is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and perihilar haziness suggesting
     an element of superimposed pulmonary edema.  The soft tissues and osseous
     structures are within normal limits.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Multifocal patchy air-space opacities within both lung bases (left greater
     than right) and small bliateral pleural effusions.  This finding is suggestive
     of multifocal pneumonia vs. aspiration event.  There is also an element of
     possible superimposed pulmonary edema.
     
     2) There is kinking of the proximal portion of the right subclavian central
     venous line.
     
     3) Patient's NG tube is in position with its distal tip within the proximal
     stomach near the gastroesophageal junction.  This NG tube should be advanced.

     Reason: SAH S/P CRANIECTOMY W RESP COMPROMISE
     Admitting Diagnosis: SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
          62 year old woman with SAH s/p craniectomy with resp compromise.            
                                               
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      interval change                                                                 
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     REASON FOR EXAM:  Subarachnoid hemorrhage status post craniectomy.  Assess for
     interval change.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast CT of the head.
     
     COMPARISON is made to CT of the head dated [**2832-7-7**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Since the previous scan, the left-sided ventricular drain has been
     repositioned and is now within the left lateral ventricle.  The previous
     hemorrhage within the occipital lobe is again visualized and has slightly
     increased surrounding edema than on the previous study. The area of previously
     noted hemorrhage within the left frontal lobe also has slightly increased
     surrounding edema.  There has, however, been no change within the midline
     shift. The ventricles are similar in appearance since the previous study.
     There appears to be a new area of hypodensity within the right posterior limb
     of the internal capsule, which was not visualized on the previous study.
     Hearniation of the right frontal lobe due to craniotomy defect is stable in
     appearance.  There is, however, a new low-density collection in the left
     frontal extraaxisl apce.
     
     The opacification of the sphenoid, maxillary and ethmoid sinuses and the
     mastoid cells is without change from its description on previous reports.
     Again noted is artifact from the intracranial coils.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Likley new right-sided posterior limb infarction.
     2. Slight increase in the amount of edema surrounding both the left frontal
     and left occipital hemorrhages.
     3. Placement of intraventricular drain in the left lateral ventricle.
     4. New low-density extraaxial fluid collection in the left frontal lobe area.

     weeks previously.  The patient presents with left upper extremity swelling,
     and an ultrasound revealed thrombus in the left subclavian, axillary and
     brachial veins.  Please place superior vena caval filter.

     assisted in the procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:  70 cc Optiray 320 at 60%.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was described to the patient's next of [**Doctor First Name **],
     and informed consent was obtained.  Access was gained into the right femoral
     vein using a 19-gauge single-wall needle.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 528**] wire was advanced without
     difficulty into the superior vena cava, followed by placement of a 4-French
     sheath.  A 4-French multi-side-hole straight catheter was then used to select
     the right internal jugular vein, and a superior venacavagram was performed
     with the catheter in the right internal jugular vein.  This demonstrated some
     thrombus in and around the right subclavian catheter, whose distal tip is in
     the mid superior vena cava.  There was some reflux of contrast into the distal
     left brachiocephalic vein.
     
     We then selected the left brachiocephalic vein using a 0.035 angled Glidewire,
     and gently manipulated the wire and catheter to the mid portion of the
     presumed left brachiocephalic vein.  However, on aspiration, no blood was
     demonstrated.  A small contrast injection was then performed, documenting near
     occlusion of the left brachiocephalic vein, with a tiny collateral branch
     patent.  The catheter was then pulled into the distal left brachiocephalic
     vein, until blood could be aspirated from the catheter.  We performed a
     superior venacavagram at this time with the catheter in the distal left
     brachiocephalic vein.  This again demonstrated some near occlusion of the left
     brachiocephalic vein, with patency of the superior vena cava.
     
     The right subclavian catheter was then pulled back approximately 5-6 cm, so
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     that the tip was in the superior vena cava.  Over a guide wire, a 6-French
     sheath was advanced to the level of the superior vena cava, and an Optease
     inferior vena caval filter was then deployed under fluoroscopic guidance in
     the superior vena cava.  The medial aspect of the filter was noted to be
     somewhat indented after placement, most likely due to arterial pulsations. The
     hook of the filter is caudal, so that if retrieval is an option, a femoral
     approach is essential.
     
     The sheath was then removed, compression was applied over the right groin
     until hemostasis achieved.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of an Optease retrievable superior vena
     caval filter from a right femoral venous approach.  The filter can be removed
     up to two weeks post placement.

     sheath was advanced to the level of the superior vena cava, and an Optease
     inferior vena caval filter was then deployed under fluoroscopic guidance in
     the superior vena cava.  The medial aspect of the filter was noted to be
     somewhat indented after placement, most likely due to arterial pulsations. The
     hook of the filter is caudal, so that if retrieval is an option, a femoral

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  63 year old female status post cerebral aneurysm coiling four
     weeks previously.  The patient presents with left upper extremity swelling,
     and an ultrasound revealed thrombus in the left subclavian, axillary and
     brachial veins.  Please place superior vena caval filter.
     
     REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 527**]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 726**].
     
     INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGIST:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 346**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2161**], Radiology Resident,
     assisted in the procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:  70 cc Optiray 320 at 60%.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was described to the patient's next of [**Doctor First Name **],
     and informed consent was obtained.  Access was gained into the right femoral
     vein using a 19-gauge single-wall needle.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 528**] wire was advanced without
     difficulty into the superior vena cava, followed by placement of a 4-French
     sheath.  A 4-French multi-side-hole straight catheter was then used to select
     the right internal jugular vein, and a superior venacavagram was performed
     with the catheter in the right internal jugular vein.  This demonstrated some
     thrombus in and around the right subclavian catheter, whose distal tip is in
     the mid superior vena cava.  There was some reflux of contrast into the distal
     left brachiocephalic vein.
     
     We then selected the left brachiocephalic vein using a 0.035 angled Glidewire,
     and gently manipulated the wire and catheter to the mid portion of the
     presumed left brachiocephalic vein.  However, on aspiration, no blood was
     demonstrated.  A small contrast injection was then performed, documenting near
     occlusion of the left brachiocephalic vein, with a tiny collateral branch
     patent.  The catheter was then pulled into the distal left brachiocephalic
     vein, until blood could be aspirated from the catheter.  We performed a
     superior venacavagram at this time with the catheter in the distal left
     brachiocephalic vein.  This again demonstrated some near occlusion of the left
     brachiocephalic vein, with patency of the superior vena cava.
     
     The right subclavian catheter was then pulled back approximately 5-6 cm, so
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  63 year old female status post cerebral aneurysm coiling four
     weeks previously.  The patient presents with left upper extremity swelling,
     and an ultrasound revealed thrombus in the left subclavian, axillary and
     brachial veins.  Please place superior vena caval filter.
     
     REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 527**]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 726**].
     
     INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGIST:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 346**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2161**], Radiology Resident,
     assisted in the procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:  70 cc Optiray 320 at 60%.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was described to the patient's next of [**Doctor First Name **],
     and informed consent was obtained.  Access was gained into the right femoral
     vein using a 19-gauge single-wall needle.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 528**] wire was advanced without
     difficulty into the superior vena cava, followed by placement of a 4-French
     sheath.  A 4-French multi-side-hole straight catheter was then used to select
     the right internal jugular vein, and a superior venacavagram was performed
     with the catheter in the right internal jugular vein.  This demonstrated some
     thrombus in and around the right subclavian catheter, whose distal tip is in
     the mid superior vena cava.  There was some reflux of contrast into the distal
     left brachiocephalic vein.
     
     We then selected the left brachiocephalic vein using a 0.035 angled Glidewire,
     and gently manipulated the wire and catheter to the mid portion of the
     presumed left brachiocephalic vein.  However, on aspiration, no blood was
     demonstrated.  A small contrast injection was then performed, documenting near
     occlusion of the left brachiocephalic vein, with a tiny collateral branch
     patent.  The catheter was then pulled into the distal left brachiocephalic
     vein, until blood could be aspirated from the catheter.  We performed a
     superior venacavagram at this time with the catheter in the distal left
     brachiocephalic vein.  This again demonstrated some near occlusion of the left
     brachiocephalic vein, with patency of the superior vena cava.
     
     The right subclavian catheter was then pulled back approximately 5-6 cm, so
                                                                 (Over)

     Reason: SAH/POST CRANIECTOMY ASSESS FOR BONE REPLACEMENT
     Admitting Diagnosis: SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
           62 year old woman with SAH s/p craniectomy with resp compromise.           
                                                 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Assessing preparation for bone replacement                                      
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST.
     
     HISTORY:  Subarachnoid hemorrhage status post craniotomy, now with respiratory
     compromise.
     
     Contiguous 5-mm axial images were obtained through the brain.  No contrast was
     administered.  Comparison is made to a head CT performed on [**2832-7-12**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There has been a slight decrease in right hemispheric mass effect
     since the most recent previous study.  There is less deformity of the frontal
     [**Doctor Last Name 67**] of the right lateral ventricle.  There has also been a slight decrease in
     the volume of extracerebral fluid in the left frontal region. Otherwise, there
     have been no significant changes.  Again identified is a large right
     craniectomy with brain herniating through the craniectomy defect.  There has
     been prior evacuation of a large right frontal hematoma with residual blood
     products and surrounding edema.  A ventricular catheter is present entering
     through the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 67**] of the left lateral ventricle and appearing to
     terminate in the region of the third ventricle or interpeduncular cistern.
     There has been coiling of a right middle cerebral artery aneurysm and of an
     anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  The mastoid air cells are largely
     opacified, unchanged since the prior study.  There is improvement in the
     partial opacification of the left maxillary sinus.  The sphenoid and ethmoid
     sinuses remain partially opacified, but somewhat improved since the prior
     study.  No new infarction or hemorrhage.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Slight decrease in right hemispheric mass effect and left frontal
     extracerebral fluid collection since the prior study.  There have been no
     other significant changes.

Events:  Pt. VSS afebrile overnoc.  No new events to report.  the 2nd set of BC was obtained by the SICU team via a right femoral stick.  Pt. conts to require q 4 hour 7.5mg of IVP Lopressor for HTN.

Review of Systems:

Neuro-  Pt. turns head toward her right side when name called with more consistency than days past.  Appears to neglect left side.  Right side withdraws to nailbed and inconsistenly appears to move toes when asked.  At 4am with am care, application of multi-podis boot, pt. appeared to spontaneously shake right leg.  Pt. was alert and tracking with eyes on right side at that time.  ? sz. activity.  However, the event was <30s and resolved spontaneously.  will alert team during am round and cont. to monitor closely for sz activity given subtherapeutic dilantin level.  ICP 5-8 overnoc.  Vent draining about 30cc q 4hrs located 5cm above tragus.  Pt. awaits bone flap repair.  

Resp-  Vent changed to lower RR.  Remains on AC 450X18(from 22)35% PEEP 5 with ABG 7.39/40/117/0/25.  Appears that pt. consistently overbreathing [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] want to trial on PSV.  LS- clear to dim. throughout, occ. coarse when requiring sx'ing.  Sx'd minimally for thick white sputum.  Pt. with strong cough, impaired gag.  Sats maintained at 98-100%.  

CV-  HR 70's-80's rising when lopressor due.  BP 110-150 with occ. breakthrough HTN when stimulated to 180's.  Did not resolve with lopressor at MN.  Therefore, at 1am pt. received 2mg of MSO4 with good effect.  (Pt. also tachypneic at that time.)  KCL 20 meQ given this am for K+ of 3.5.  HCT stable at 34 this am.    

Derm-  Pt. conts with skin rash throughout which is less red than yesterday.  Pt. skin continues to be quite edemedous with orange peel texture, weeping from old puncture sites.  Keeping close watch on right groin d/t BC draw from that site.  No hematoma nor bruising noted this time.  

GI-  ABD soft/ distended.  Minimal BS.  Passing sm. soft brown stool.  TF held at MN for residuals of 120.  Most likely related to many PO meds needed during the evening.  Restarted at half goal rate at 40cc/hr.  Will attempt to advance q 4 hours.  Off reglan.  Pt. may need more intense bowel regimen if TF are not being tolerated...

GU-  Pt. received lasix on day shift.  No further doses given.  Cont on diamox.  U/O adequate.  Amber and clear with occ. sediment.  

ID-  Conts on levoflox d2 and vanco.  GNR found in 1 anaerobic bottle from [**7-22**].  2 subsequent sets of BC bottles sent from art line yesterday and one stick from femoral area obtained by Dr. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].  

Plan-  would consider PSV trial and aggressive diuresis, cont usual care re: neuro checks, ICP monitoring etc., cont to monitor for sz activity given low dilantin levels.

     are noted.
     
     There is a tracheostomy tube and SVC filter.  There is no significant change
     in the heart and mediastinal contours.  Again seen are bilateral alveolar
     opacities, right greater than left.  These are unchanged with differential
     including multifocal infection, ARDS, and less likely asymmetric edema.

     HISTORY:  Very difficult IV access.  Intravenous antibiotics required.  IV
     Therapy was not able to advance a PICC line.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2166**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1584**] and [**Doctor Last Name 603**], Attending
     Physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1636**] present throughout the entire procedure. The right upper arm
     was prepped in a sterile fashion. Since no suitable superficial veins were
     visible, ultrasound was used for localization of a suitable vein.  The basilic
     vein was patent and compressible.  Under local anesthesia with 2 cc of 1%
     lidocaine, the basilic vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a
     21-gauge needle.  A 0.018 guide wire was advanced.  The PICC line was trimmed
     to 50 cm and advanced over a 4-French introducer sheath.  The sheath was
     removed.  The catheter was flushed.  A Stat-Lock was applied and the line was
     heplocked.
     
     As this procedure was performed at the bedside in the [**Hospital Unit Name 1245**], fluoroscopic
     guidance could not be used.  Final chest x-ray is pending.  The line should

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Very difficult IV access.  Intravenous antibiotics required.  IV
     Therapy was not able to advance a PICC line.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2166**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1584**] and [**Doctor Last Name 603**], Attending
     Physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1636**] present throughout the entire procedure. The right upper arm
     was prepped in a sterile fashion. Since no suitable superficial veins were
     visible, ultrasound was used for localization of a suitable vein.  The basilic
     vein was patent and compressible.  Under local anesthesia with 2 cc of 1%
     lidocaine, the basilic vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a
     21-gauge needle.  A 0.018 guide wire was advanced.  The PICC line was trimmed
     to 50 cm and advanced over a 4-French introducer sheath.  The sheath was
     removed.  The catheter was flushed.  A Stat-Lock was applied and the line was
     heplocked.
     
     As this procedure was performed at the bedside in the [**Hospital Unit Name 1245**], fluoroscopic
     guidance could not be used.  Final chest x-ray is pending.  The line should
     not be used until chest x-ray confirmation of tip placement has been achieved.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Bedside placement of 50-cm basilic PICC line under ultrasound
     guidance.  Line should not be used until confirmation of position has been
     achieved with chest x-ray, which is pending.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 63 year old female with a known deep venous thrombosis extending
     from her brachial vein to the subclavian vein.  Evaluate for ascending clot.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Left upper extremity venous ultrasound with doppler.
     
     COMPARISON: [**2832-7-17**].
     
     FINDINGS: The previously described subclavian thrombus is no longer
     demonstrated. The left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial,
     basilic, and cephalic veins demonstrate normal compressibility, color flow,
     and doppler wave forms.  This may be compatible with interval recanalization.
     
     IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis within the left upper
     extremity.  This finding is suggestive interval recanalization of the
     previously described subclavian thrombus.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
          62 year old woman with SAH s/p craniectomy with resp compromise.

     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Status post subarachnoid hemorrhage.
     
     TECHNIQUE: CT head without contrast.
     
     Comparison is made to the prior CT head on [**2832-7-20**].
     
     FINDINGS: There has been interval placement of a bone flap over the prior
     right craniectomy defect which appears to be in good alignment without
     evidence of depression. There is a small amount of adjacent mixed-density
     extra-axial fluid collection and pneumocephalus likely secondary to
     postsurgical changes.  There is also a large adjacent right scalp hematoma
     over the bone flap.  The right frontal lobe in the region of the prior
     hemorrhage appears malacic.  There are no other areas of hemorrhage or change
     in the appearance of the brain parenchyma. A ventricular catheter is again
     present entering through the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 67**] of the lateral ventricle and
     terminating in the third ventricle. The ventricles appear slightly more
     dilated than the prior scan. There is again note of two coil masses causing
     extensive artifact in the region of the right basal ganglia and middle fossa.
     The remaining surrounding osseous and visualized paranasal sinuses are
     unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION: Status post bone replacement after right craniectomy.  Small
     adjacent extra-axial fluid collection without mass effect.

     HISTORY:  SAH with PA line. Question pneumonia or aspiration.
     
     CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
     
     Detail is obscured by respiratory motion.  Allowing for this, there are
     diffuse bilateral interstitial and alveolar opacities with relative sparring
     of the left upper and mid zones.  Compared with [**2832-7-30**], there is increased
     retrocardiac density, with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and cardiac
     border, consistent with left lower lobe collapse/consolidation. The patient is
     status post tracheostomy.  There is a right sided PICC line -- of note, the
     tip is doubled back on itself and projects over the right subclavian vein at
     the level of the medial right clavicle.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Diffuse infiltrates with interval development of left lower lobe
     collapse/consolidation.
     2) Right PICC line curved back on itself, overlying medial portion of right
     subclavian vein, similar to appearance on [**2832-7-30**]. Clinical correlation is
     requested.

     HISTORY:  SAH with PA line, wheezing and crackles that are new.
     
     CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE SUPINE VIEW
     
     The pleural and parenchymal findings are in great part unchanged compared with
     [**2832-8-14**].  There is a cage-like device superimposed over the right hilum.
     Review of the electronic record describes placement of a filter in the SVC for
     thrombus in the left subclavian axillary and brachial veins on [**2832-7-18**].
     Alignment is unchanged compared with [**2832-7-30**], although the filter was not seen
     on the [**2832-8-14**] x-ray.  Again seen is the right subclavian PIC line.  It is
     looped within the vessel.  Compared with [**2832-8-14**], it has advanced into the
     proximal SVC immediately above the filter.  There is a 1 cm rounded lucency
     superimposed over a right hilar vessel -- question confluence of shadows.
     Attention to this area on followup films is recommended.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Upper zone redistribution, interstitial edema, and small bilateral pleural
     effusions.  Underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.  Overall
     pattern is similar to that seen on [**2832-8-14**].
     
     2.  PICC line which is abnormally looped and has now advanced into the SVC.
     Because it is doubled-back, the tip of the line remains in the SVC.  Clinical
     correlation is required regarding possible replacement of this line.
     
     3.  Venacaval filter in the proximal SVC.
     
     4.  Tracheostomy.

     HISTORY:  Respiratory compromise.  Status post subarachnoid hemorrhage.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison with the prior study of [**2832-8-10**] reveals interval
     development of a large chronic infarct within the right middle cerebral artery
     territory.  There has also been nearly doubling in the size of the
     suparatentorial ventricular system.  This finding could represent both
     porencephalic dilatation, as well as comminucating hydrocephalus, although a
     ventricular drainage catheter remains in place.  Assessment for functioning of
     this catheter is suggested.
     
     The fourth ventricle is not dilated. There is no new intracranial hemorrhage.
     Once again, the scan quality is extremely limited by massive artifacts arising
     from coiling material.
     
     CONSLUSION:  Interval development of infarction within the right middle
     cerebral artery territory.  Other findings as noted above.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Previously ruptured right middle cerebral artery
     aneurysm and unruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm and high grade
     subarachnoid hemorrhage.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same with interval aneurysmal regrowth of the right
     middle cerebral artery aneurysm at the neck and stable appearance of the
     previously treated anterior communicating artery aneurysm.
     
     INDICATION:  Mr. [**Known patient firstname 2177**] [**Known patient lastname 2132**] suffered a high grade subarachnoid hemorrhage
     from the ruptured right middle cerebral artery aneurysm.  She underwent
     endovascular therapy of this aneurysm as well as an unruptured anterior
     communicating artery aneurysm from the left-sided approach and subsequently
     underwent emergent craniectomy for elevated intracranial pressure.  Following
     a protracted hospital course, she has since had a significant improvement in
     her neurological status in rehabilitation and is currently undergoing cerebral
     angiogram to follow up on the previously treated aneurysm.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient, her husband, and her son were given a full and complete
     explanation of the procedure.  Specifically the indications, risks, benefits
     and alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail.  In addition the
     possible complications such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
     neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
     complications including the risk of coma and even death were outlined.  The
     patient, her husband, and her son understood and wished to proceed with the
     operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge single wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood, a 4 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and kept
     on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to

     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     Right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, left common
     carotid artery, left internal carotid artery, left external carotid artery,
     left subclavian artery, and left vertebral artery.
     
     RESULTS:  Injection of the right common carotid artery showed the presence of
     a 30% atherosclerotic stenosis in the cervical region of the right internal
     carotid artery origin.  Injection of the right internal carotid artery with
     three dimensional rotational angiography showed the presence of a new regrowth
     at the aneurysm neck measuring approximately 8 mm x 4 mm.  This will be
     treated in the future but may require the use of an endovascular stent.
     Accordingly the patient will be placed on antibiotic therapy prior to the next
     treatment session.  Injection of the left common carotid artery shows 20%
     atherosclerotic disease at the origin of the left internal carotid artery into
     the neck.  Injection of the left internal carotid artery intracranially showed
     filling of the anterior communicating artery with stable appearance of the
     previously treated ACOM aneurysm.  The proximal portion of the right A2
     segment which fills the left ICA injection shows a small aneurysmal dilatation
     of approximately 1 1/2 mm in depth which is unchanged compared to a previous
     procedure.  Injection of the left external carotid artery was within normal
     limits.  Injection of the left subclavian artery showed a 30% atherosclerotic
     shelf proximal to the origin of left vertebral artery.  Injection of the left
     vertebral artery showed no atherosclerotic involvement of the left vertebral
     artery at its origin.  The cervical course of the left vertebral artery was
     normal and intracranially the left vertebral artery was dominant with a normal
     appearance of the basilar artery and its branches.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Interval regrowth of the right middle cerebral artery aneurysm
     and its neck which will be retreated and stable appearance of the previously
     treated anterior communicating artery aneurysm.

     carotid artery, left internal carotid artery, left external carotid artery,
     left subclavian artery, and left vertebral artery.
     
     RESULTS:  Injection of the right common carotid artery showed the presence of
     a 30% atherosclerotic stenosis in the cervical region of the right internal
     carotid artery origin.  Injection of the right internal carotid artery with
     three dimensional rotational angiography showed the presence of a new regrowth

     atherosclerotic disease at the origin of the left internal carotid artery into
     the neck.  Injection of the left internal carotid artery intracranially showed
     filling of the anterior communicating artery with stable appearance of the

     segment which fills the left ICA injection shows a small aneurysmal dilatation
     of approximately 1 1/2 mm in depth which is unchanged compared to a previous

     limits.  Injection of the left subclavian artery showed a 30% atherosclerotic
     shelf proximal to the origin of left vertebral artery.  Injection of the left
     vertebral artery showed no atherosclerotic involvement of the left vertebral
     artery at its origin.  The cervical course of the left vertebral artery was

     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Previously ruptured right middle cerebral artery
     aneurysm and unruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm and high grade
     subarachnoid hemorrhage.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same with interval aneurysmal regrowth of the right
     middle cerebral artery aneurysm at the neck and stable appearance of the
     previously treated anterior communicating artery aneurysm.
     
     INDICATION:  Mr. [**Known patient firstname 2177**] [**Known patient lastname 2132**] suffered a high grade subarachnoid hemorrhage
     from the ruptured right middle cerebral artery aneurysm.  She underwent
     endovascular therapy of this aneurysm as well as an unruptured anterior
     communicating artery aneurysm from the left-sided approach and subsequently
     underwent emergent craniectomy for elevated intracranial pressure.  Following
     a protracted hospital course, she has since had a significant improvement in
     her neurological status in rehabilitation and is currently undergoing cerebral
     angiogram to follow up on the previously treated aneurysm.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient, her husband, and her son were given a full and complete
     explanation of the procedure.  Specifically the indications, risks, benefits
     and alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail.  In addition the
     possible complications such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
     neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
     complications including the risk of coma and even death were outlined.  The
     patient, her husband, and her son understood and wished to proceed with the

     carotid artery, left internal carotid artery, left external carotid artery,
     left subclavian artery, and left vertebral artery.
     
     RESULTS:  Injection of the right common carotid artery showed the presence of
     a 30% atherosclerotic stenosis in the cervical region of the right internal
     carotid artery origin.  Injection of the right internal carotid artery with
     three dimensional rotational angiography showed the presence of a new regrowth

     treated in the future but may require the use of an endovascular stent.
     Accordingly the patient will be placed on antibiotic therapy prior to the next

     atherosclerotic disease at the origin of the left internal carotid artery into
     the neck.  Injection of the left internal carotid artery intracranially showed
     filling of the anterior communicating artery with stable appearance of the
     previously treated ACOM aneurysm.  The proximal portion of the right A2
     segment which fills the left ICA injection shows a small aneurysmal dilatation
     of approximately 1 1/2 mm in depth which is unchanged compared to a previous
     procedure.  Injection of the left external carotid artery was within normal
     limits.  Injection of the left subclavian artery showed a 30% atherosclerotic
     shelf proximal to the origin of left vertebral artery.  Injection of the left
     vertebral artery showed no atherosclerotic involvement of the left vertebral
     artery at its origin.  The cervical course of the left vertebral artery was
     normal and intracranially the left vertebral artery was dominant with a normal

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      63 year old woman with aneurysm.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      SAME DAY ADMIT.  START TIME 9:30.  Cerebral angiogram with possible coiling of
      aneurysm.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Previously ruptured right middle cerebral artery
     aneurysm and unruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm and high grade
     subarachnoid hemorrhage.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same with interval aneurysmal regrowth of the right
     middle cerebral artery aneurysm at the neck and stable appearance of the
     previously treated anterior communicating artery aneurysm.
     
     INDICATION:  Mr. [**Known patient firstname 2177**] [**Known patient lastname 2132**] suffered a high grade subarachnoid hemorrhage
     from the ruptured right middle cerebral artery aneurysm.  She underwent
     endovascular therapy of this aneurysm as well as an unruptured anterior
     communicating artery aneurysm from the left-sided approach and subsequently
     underwent emergent craniectomy for elevated intracranial pressure.  Following
     a protracted hospital course, she has since had a significant improvement in
     her neurological status in rehabilitation and is currently undergoing cerebral
     angiogram to follow up on the previously treated aneurysm.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient, her husband, and her son were given a full and complete
     explanation of the procedure.  Specifically the indications, risks, benefits
     and alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail.  In addition the
     possible complications such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
     neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
     complications including the risk of coma and even death were outlined.  The
     patient, her husband, and her son understood and wished to proceed with the
     operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge single wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood, a 4 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and kept
     on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
                                                                 (Over)

     Right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, left common
     carotid artery, left internal carotid artery, left external carotid artery,
     left subclavian artery, and left vertebral artery.
     
     RESULTS:  Injection of the right common carotid artery showed the presence of
     a 30% atherosclerotic stenosis in the cervical region of the right internal
     carotid artery origin.  Injection of the right internal carotid artery with
     three dimensional rotational angiography showed the presence of a new regrowth
     at the aneurysm neck measuring approximately 8 mm x 4 mm.  This will be
     treated in the future but may require the use of an endovascular stent.
     Accordingly the patient will be placed on antibiotic therapy prior to the next
     treatment session.  Injection of the left common carotid artery shows 20%
     atherosclerotic disease at the origin of the left internal carotid artery into
     the neck.  Injection of the left internal carotid artery intracranially showed
     filling of the anterior communicating artery with stable appearance of the
     previously treated ACOM aneurysm.  The proximal portion of the right A2
     segment which fills the left ICA injection shows a small aneurysmal dilatation
     of approximately 1 1/2 mm in depth which is unchanged compared to a previous
     procedure.  Injection of the left external carotid artery was within normal
     limits.  Injection of the left subclavian artery showed a 30% atherosclerotic
     shelf proximal to the origin of left vertebral artery.  Injection of the left
     vertebral artery showed no atherosclerotic involvement of the left vertebral
     artery at its origin.  The cervical course of the left vertebral artery was
     normal and intracranially the left vertebral artery was dominant with a normal
     appearance of the basilar artery and its branches.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Interval regrowth of the right middle cerebral artery aneurysm
     and its neck which will be retreated and stable appearance of the previously
     treated anterior communicating artery aneurysm.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      63 year old woman with aneurysm.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      SAME DAY ADMIT.  START TIME 9:30.  Cerebral angiogram with possible coiling of
      aneurysm.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Previously ruptured right middle cerebral artery
     aneurysm and unruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm and high grade
     subarachnoid hemorrhage.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same with interval aneurysmal regrowth of the right
     middle cerebral artery aneurysm at the neck and stable appearance of the
     previously treated anterior communicating artery aneurysm.
     
     INDICATION:  Mr. [**Known patient firstname 2177**] [**Known patient lastname 2132**] suffered a high grade subarachnoid hemorrhage
     from the ruptured right middle cerebral artery aneurysm.  She underwent
     endovascular therapy of this aneurysm as well as an unruptured anterior
     communicating artery aneurysm from the left-sided approach and subsequently
     underwent emergent craniectomy for elevated intracranial pressure.  Following
     a protracted hospital course, she has since had a significant improvement in
     her neurological status in rehabilitation and is currently undergoing cerebral
     angiogram to follow up on the previously treated aneurysm.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient, her husband, and her son were given a full and complete
     explanation of the procedure.  Specifically the indications, risks, benefits
     and alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail.  In addition the
     possible complications such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke,
     neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen
     complications including the risk of coma and even death were outlined.  The
     patient, her husband, and her son understood and wished to proceed with the
     operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge single wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood, a 4 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and kept
     on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
                                                                 (Over)

     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     Right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, left common
     carotid artery, left internal carotid artery, left external carotid artery,
     left subclavian artery, and left vertebral artery.
     
     RESULTS:  Injection of the right common carotid artery showed the presence of
     a 30% atherosclerotic stenosis in the cervical region of the right internal
     carotid artery origin.  Injection of the right internal carotid artery with
     three dimensional rotational angiography showed the presence of a new regrowth
     at the aneurysm neck measuring approximately 8 mm x 4 mm.  This will be
     treated in the future but may require the use of an endovascular stent.
     Accordingly the patient will be placed on antibiotic therapy prior to the next
     treatment session.  Injection of the left common carotid artery shows 20%
     atherosclerotic disease at the origin of the left internal carotid artery into
     the neck.  Injection of the left internal carotid artery intracranially showed
     filling of the anterior communicating artery with stable appearance of the
     previously treated ACOM aneurysm.  The proximal portion of the right A2
     segment which fills the left ICA injection shows a small aneurysmal dilatation
     of approximately 1 1/2 mm in depth which is unchanged compared to a previous
     procedure.  Injection of the left external carotid artery was within normal
     limits.  Injection of the left subclavian artery showed a 30% atherosclerotic
     shelf proximal to the origin of left vertebral artery.  Injection of the left
     vertebral artery showed no atherosclerotic involvement of the left vertebral
     artery at its origin.  The cervical course of the left vertebral artery was
     normal and intracranially the left vertebral artery was dominant with a normal
     appearance of the basilar artery and its branches.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Interval regrowth of the right middle cerebral artery aneurysm
     and its neck which will be retreated and stable appearance of the previously
     treated anterior communicating artery aneurysm.

     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge signal wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood, a 5 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire
     and kept on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     Right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, right middle
     cerebral artery, right M3 branch of the middle cerebral artery.  After the
     patient has been placed on Plavix and desensitize using gradual dosage of
     aspirin, a procedure was scheduled and the patient was brought to the
     endovascular suite.  The guide catheter was then used to selectively
     catheterize the right common carotid artery with an angiographic run revealed
     the presence of diffuse atherosclerotic disease which is unchanged compared to
     previously.  Angiographic run was performed then of the right internal carotid
     and biplane and two dimensional rotational angiography mode which helpded
     define the wide neck of the aneurysm and the pocket of loosely packed coils.
     At this point, a  microcatheter was used coaxially over a 200 cm exchange MPI
     wire.  The MTI X-celerator wire was then used to selectively place the
     microcatheter into the inferior division of the middle cerebral artery on the
     right side. With the microcatheter in this branch, the wire was advanced well
     into M3 branch consistent with the angular branch of the angular division of
     the middle cerebral artery.  The microcatheter was then removed and a
     neuroform stent was guided over the exchange wire and delivered across the
     cerebral artery bifurcation.  This unable us then to keep the stent in
     position.  After deployment an angiographic run was performed which showed no
     evidence of branch occlusion or compromise by the stent deployed.
     Subsequently, the wire was withdrawn up to the middle cerebral artery location
     and the microcatheter  was then used to cross the interstices of the stent
     into the neck residual.  With the microcatheter in the aneurysm, residual
     series of GDC coils were advanced until they were clearly in contact with the
     stent interstices.  At this point, an angiographic run was performed in
     biplane and two dimensional rotational angiography which showed an excellent
     result.  The microcatheter was then withdrawn and a final angiographic run was
     performed in the biplane projection as well as one of the neck which showed no
     evidence of intimal injury to the carotid artery.  At this point, the guide
     catheter was withdrawn.  The patient was then awokened from anesthesia and
     transferred to the post anesthesia care unit in stable condition.
     
     RESULTS:  Persistent 4 mm pocket of the previously treated right middle
     cerebral aneurysm embolized using a combination of GDC coils and neuroform
     stent with an excellent angiographic result with no evidence of iatrogenic
     branch occlusion.

     and biplane and two dimensional rotational angiography mode which helpded
     define the wide neck of the aneurysm and the pocket of loosely packed coils.
     At this point, a  microcatheter was used coaxially over a 200 cm exchange MPI
     wire.  The MTI X-celerator wire was then used to selectively place the
     microcatheter into the inferior division of the middle cerebral artery on the
     right side. With the microcatheter in this branch, the wire was advanced well
     into M3 branch consistent with the angular branch of the angular division of
     the middle cerebral artery.  The microcatheter was then removed and a
     neuroform stent was guided over the exchange wire and delivered across the
     cerebral artery bifurcation.  This unable us then to keep the stent in
     position.  After deployment an angiographic run was performed which showed no
     evidence of branch occlusion or compromise by the stent deployed.
     Subsequently, the wire was withdrawn up to the middle cerebral artery location
     and the microcatheter  was then used to cross the interstices of the stent
     into the neck residual.  With the microcatheter in the aneurysm, residual
     series of GDC coils were advanced until they were clearly in contact with the
     stent interstices.  At this point, an angiographic run was performed in
     biplane and two dimensional rotational angiography which showed an excellent
     result.  The microcatheter was then withdrawn and a final angiographic run was
     performed in the biplane projection as well as one of the neck which showed no
     evidence of intimal injury to the carotid artery.  At this point, the guide
     catheter was withdrawn.  The patient was then awokened from anesthesia and
     transferred to the post anesthesia care unit in stable condition.
     
     RESULTS:  Persistent 4 mm pocket of the previously treated right middle
     cerebral aneurysm embolized using a combination of GDC coils and neuroform
     stent with an excellent angiographic result with no evidence of iatrogenic
     branch occlusion.

     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge signal wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood, a 5 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire
     and kept on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     Right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, right middle
     cerebral artery, right M3 branch of the middle cerebral artery.  After the
     patient has been placed on Plavix and desensitize using gradual dosage of
     aspirin, a procedure was scheduled and the patient was brought to the
     endovascular suite.  The guide catheter was then used to selectively
     catheterize the right common carotid artery with an angiographic run revealed

     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge signal wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood, a 5 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire
     and kept on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     Right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, right middle
     cerebral artery, right M3 branch of the middle cerebral artery.  After the
     patient has been placed on Plavix and desensitize using gradual dosage of
     aspirin, a procedure was scheduled and the patient was brought to the
     endovascular suite.  The guide catheter was then used to selectively
     catheterize the right common carotid artery with an angiographic run revealed
     the presence of diffuse atherosclerotic disease which is unchanged compared to
     previously.  Angiographic run was performed then of the right internal carotid
     and biplane and two dimensional rotational angiography mode which helpded
     define the wide neck of the aneurysm and the pocket of loosely packed coils.
     At this point, a  microcatheter was used coaxially over a 200 cm exchange MPI
     wire.  The MTI X-celerator wire was then used to selectively place the
     microcatheter into the inferior division of the middle cerebral artery on the
     right side. With the microcatheter in this branch, the wire was advanced well
     into M3 branch consistent with the angular branch of the angular division of
     the middle cerebral artery.  The microcatheter was then removed and a
     neuroform stent was guided over the exchange wire and delivered across the
     cerebral artery bifurcation.  This unable us then to keep the stent in
     position.  After deployment an angiographic run was performed which showed no
     evidence of branch occlusion or compromise by the stent deployed.
     Subsequently, the wire was withdrawn up to the middle cerebral artery location
     and the microcatheter  was then used to cross the interstices of the stent
     into the neck residual.  With the microcatheter in the aneurysm, residual
     series of GDC coils were advanced until they were clearly in contact with the
     stent interstices.  At this point, an angiographic run was performed in
     biplane and two dimensional rotational angiography which showed an excellent
     result.  The microcatheter was then withdrawn and a final angiographic run was
     performed in the biplane projection as well as one of the neck which showed no
     evidence of intimal injury to the carotid artery.  At this point, the guide
     catheter was withdrawn.  The patient was then awokened from anesthesia and
     transferred to the post anesthesia care unit in stable condition.
     
     RESULTS:  Persistent 4 mm pocket of the previously treated right middle
     cerebral aneurysm embolized using a combination of GDC coils and neuroform
     stent with an excellent angiographic result with no evidence of iatrogenic
     branch occlusion.

     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge signal wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood, a 5 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire
     and kept on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     Right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, right middle
     cerebral artery, right M3 branch of the middle cerebral artery.  After the
     patient has been placed on Plavix and desensitize using gradual dosage of
     aspirin, a procedure was scheduled and the patient was brought to the
     endovascular suite.  The guide catheter was then used to selectively
     catheterize the right common carotid artery with an angiographic run revealed
     the presence of diffuse atherosclerotic disease which is unchanged compared to
     previously.  Angiographic run was performed then of the right internal carotid
     and biplane and two dimensional rotational angiography mode which helpded
     define the wide neck of the aneurysm and the pocket of loosely packed coils.
     At this point, a  microcatheter was used coaxially over a 200 cm exchange MPI
     wire.  The MTI X-celerator wire was then used to selectively place the
     microcatheter into the inferior division of the middle cerebral artery on the
     right side. With the microcatheter in this branch, the wire was advanced well
     into M3 branch consistent with the angular branch of the angular division of
     the middle cerebral artery.  The microcatheter was then removed and a
     neuroform stent was guided over the exchange wire and delivered across the
     cerebral artery bifurcation.  This unable us then to keep the stent in
     position.  After deployment an angiographic run was performed which showed no
     evidence of branch occlusion or compromise by the stent deployed.
     Subsequently, the wire was withdrawn up to the middle cerebral artery location
     and the microcatheter  was then used to cross the interstices of the stent
     into the neck residual.  With the microcatheter in the aneurysm, residual
     series of GDC coils were advanced until they were clearly in contact with the
     stent interstices.  At this point, an angiographic run was performed in
     biplane and two dimensional rotational angiography which showed an excellent
     result.  The microcatheter was then withdrawn and a final angiographic run was
     performed in the biplane projection as well as one of the neck which showed no
     evidence of intimal injury to the carotid artery.  At this point, the guide
     catheter was withdrawn.  The patient was then awokened from anesthesia and
     transferred to the post anesthesia care unit in stable condition.
     
     RESULTS:  Persistent 4 mm pocket of the previously treated right middle
     cerebral aneurysm embolized using a combination of GDC coils and neuroform
     stent with an excellent angiographic result with no evidence of iatrogenic
     branch occlusion.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Grade 5 previously ruptured aneurysm status post
     endovascular coil embolization with neurological recovery now showing evidence
     of persistent loosely packed coils at the origin of the right middle cerebral
     artery.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same.  Status post stent mediated coil embolization
     of the neck of the right middle cerebral artery aneurysm.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal anesthesia.
     
     INDICATION:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 2132**] is a patient who suffered a high grade subarachnoid
     hemorrhage requiring craniectomy and a prolonged stay in the intensive care
     unit followed by extensive rehabilitation.  She has made an excellent recovery
     which has left her with mild left-sided hemiparesis.  At the time of her
     initial treatment, the right middle cerebral artery aneurysm which was noted
     to be wide neck could not be treated completely at the neck although the
     rupture site was secured with coils and the patient did an excellent recovery.
     The neck of the aneurysm was relatively loosely packed because its wide neck.
     Accordingly she is undergoing this procedure in order to perform a stent
     mediated coil embolization and packing of the neck of the right middle
     cerebral aneurysm.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient and her son and her husband were given a full and
     complete explanation of the procedure.  Specifically the indications, risks,
     benefits and alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail.  In
     addition the possible complications such as the risk of bleeding, infection,
     stroke, neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other
     unforeseen complications including the risk of coma and even death were
     outlined.  The patient and her son and her husband understood and wished to
     proceed with the operation.

     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge signal wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood, a 5 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire
     and kept on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     Right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, right middle
     cerebral artery, right M3 branch of the middle cerebral artery.  After the
     patient has been placed on Plavix and desensitize using gradual dosage of
     aspirin, a procedure was scheduled and the patient was brought to the
     endovascular suite.  The guide catheter was then used to selectively
     catheterize the right common carotid artery with an angiographic run revealed
     the presence of diffuse atherosclerotic disease which is unchanged compared to
     previously.  Angiographic run was performed then of the right internal carotid
     and biplane and two dimensional rotational angiography mode which helpded
     define the wide neck of the aneurysm and the pocket of loosely packed coils.
     At this point, a  microcatheter was used coaxially over a 200 cm exchange MPI
     wire.  The MTI X-celerator wire was then used to selectively place the
     microcatheter into the inferior division of the middle cerebral artery on the
     right side. With the microcatheter in this branch, the wire was advanced well
     into M3 branch consistent with the angular branch of the angular division of
     the middle cerebral artery.  The microcatheter was then removed and a
     neuroform stent was guided over the exchange wire and delivered across the
     cerebral artery bifurcation.  This unable us then to keep the stent in
     position.  After deployment an angiographic run was performed which showed no
     evidence of branch occlusion or compromise by the stent deployed.
     Subsequently, the wire was withdrawn up to the middle cerebral artery location
     and the microcatheter  was then used to cross the interstices of the stent
     into the neck residual.  With the microcatheter in the aneurysm, residual
     series of GDC coils were advanced until they were clearly in contact with the
     stent interstices.  At this point, an angiographic run was performed in
     biplane and two dimensional rotational angiography which showed an excellent
     result.  The microcatheter was then withdrawn and a final angiographic run was
     performed in the biplane projection as well as one of the neck which showed no
     evidence of intimal injury to the carotid artery.  At this point, the guide
     catheter was withdrawn.  The patient was then awokened from anesthesia and
     transferred to the post anesthesia care unit in stable condition.
     
     RESULTS:  Persistent 4 mm pocket of the previously treated right middle
     cerebral aneurysm embolized using a combination of GDC coils and neuroform
     stent with an excellent angiographic result with no evidence of iatrogenic
     branch occlusion.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Grade 5 previously ruptured aneurysm status post
     endovascular coil embolization with neurological recovery now showing evidence
     of persistent loosely packed coils at the origin of the right middle cerebral
     artery.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same.  Status post stent mediated coil embolization
     of the neck of the right middle cerebral artery aneurysm.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal anesthesia.
     
     INDICATION:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 2132**] is a patient who suffered a high grade subarachnoid
     hemorrhage requiring craniectomy and a prolonged stay in the intensive care
     unit followed by extensive rehabilitation.  She has made an excellent recovery
     which has left her with mild left-sided hemiparesis.  At the time of her
     initial treatment, the right middle cerebral artery aneurysm which was noted
     to be wide neck could not be treated completely at the neck although the
     rupture site was secured with coils and the patient did an excellent recovery.
     The neck of the aneurysm was relatively loosely packed because its wide neck.
     Accordingly she is undergoing this procedure in order to perform a stent
     mediated coil embolization and packing of the neck of the right middle
     cerebral aneurysm.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient and her son and her husband were given a full and
     complete explanation of the procedure.  Specifically the indications, risks,
     benefits and alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail.  In
     addition the possible complications such as the risk of bleeding, infection,
     stroke, neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other
     unforeseen complications including the risk of coma and even death were
     outlined.  The patient and her son and her husband understood and wished to
     proceed with the operation.

     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge signal wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood, a 5 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire
     and kept on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     Right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, right middle
     cerebral artery, right M3 branch of the middle cerebral artery.  After the
     patient has been placed on Plavix and desensitize using gradual dosage of
     aspirin, a procedure was scheduled and the patient was brought to the
     endovascular suite.  The guide catheter was then used to selectively
     catheterize the right common carotid artery with an angiographic run revealed
     the presence of diffuse atherosclerotic disease which is unchanged compared to
     previously.  Angiographic run was performed then of the right internal carotid
     and biplane and two dimensional rotational angiography mode which helpded
     define the wide neck of the aneurysm and the pocket of loosely packed coils.
     At this point, a  microcatheter was used coaxially over a 200 cm exchange MPI
     wire.  The MTI X-celerator wire was then used to selectively place the
     microcatheter into the inferior division of the middle cerebral artery on the
     right side. With the microcatheter in this branch, the wire was advanced well
     into M3 branch consistent with the angular branch of the angular division of
     the middle cerebral artery.  The microcatheter was then removed and a
     neuroform stent was guided over the exchange wire and delivered across the
     cerebral artery bifurcation.  This unable us then to keep the stent in
     position.  After deployment an angiographic run was performed which showed no
     evidence of branch occlusion or compromise by the stent deployed.
     Subsequently, the wire was withdrawn up to the middle cerebral artery location
     and the microcatheter  was then used to cross the interstices of the stent
     into the neck residual.  With the microcatheter in the aneurysm, residual
     series of GDC coils were advanced until they were clearly in contact with the
     stent interstices.  At this point, an angiographic run was performed in
     biplane and two dimensional rotational angiography which showed an excellent
     result.  The microcatheter was then withdrawn and a final angiographic run was
     performed in the biplane projection as well as one of the neck which showed no
     evidence of intimal injury to the carotid artery.  At this point, the guide
     catheter was withdrawn.  The patient was then awokened from anesthesia and
     transferred to the post anesthesia care unit in stable condition.
     
     RESULTS:  Persistent 4 mm pocket of the previously treated right middle
     cerebral aneurysm embolized using a combination of GDC coils and neuroform
     stent with an excellent angiographic result with no evidence of iatrogenic
     branch occlusion.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      63 year old woman with aneurysm.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      IN-PATIENT.  CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM USING NEUROFORM STENT.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Grade 5 previously ruptured aneurysm status post
     endovascular coil embolization with neurological recovery now showing evidence
     of persistent loosely packed coils at the origin of the right middle cerebral
     artery.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same.  Status post stent mediated coil embolization
     of the neck of the right middle cerebral artery aneurysm.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal anesthesia.
     
     INDICATION:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 2132**] is a patient who suffered a high grade subarachnoid
     hemorrhage requiring craniectomy and a prolonged stay in the intensive care
     unit followed by extensive rehabilitation.  She has made an excellent recovery
     which has left her with mild left-sided hemiparesis.  At the time of her
     initial treatment, the right middle cerebral artery aneurysm which was noted
     to be wide neck could not be treated completely at the neck although the
     rupture site was secured with coils and the patient did an excellent recovery.
     The neck of the aneurysm was relatively loosely packed because its wide neck.
     Accordingly she is undergoing this procedure in order to perform a stent
     mediated coil embolization and packing of the neck of the right middle
     cerebral aneurysm.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient and her son and her husband were given a full and
     complete explanation of the procedure.  Specifically the indications, risks,
     benefits and alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail.  In
     addition the possible complications such as the risk of bleeding, infection,
     stroke, neurological deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other
     unforeseen complications including the risk of coma and even death were
     outlined.  The patient and her son and her husband understood and wished to
     proceed with the operation.
                                                                 (Over)

     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought in the endovascular suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 19 gauge signal wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood, a 5 FR vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire
     and kept on a heparinized saline drip.  Next a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession:
     Right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, right middle
     cerebral artery, right M3 branch of the middle cerebral artery.  After the
     patient has been placed on Plavix and desensitize using gradual dosage of
     aspirin, a procedure was scheduled and the patient was brought to the
     endovascular suite.  The guide catheter was then used to selectively
     catheterize the right common carotid artery with an angiographic run revealed
     the presence of diffuse atherosclerotic disease which is unchanged compared to
     previously.  Angiographic run was performed then of the right internal carotid
     and biplane and two dimensional rotational angiography mode which helpded
     define the wide neck of the aneurysm and the pocket of loosely packed coils.
     At this point, a  microcatheter was used coaxially over a 200 cm exchange MPI
     wire.  The MTI X-celerator wire was then used to selectively place the
     microcatheter into the inferior division of the middle cerebral artery on the
     right side. With the microcatheter in this branch, the wire was advanced well
     into M3 branch consistent with the angular branch of the angular division of
     the middle cerebral artery.  The microcatheter was then removed and a
     neuroform stent was guided over the exchange wire and delivered across the
     cerebral artery bifurcation.  This unable us then to keep the stent in
     position.  After deployment an angiographic run was performed which showed no
     evidence of branch occlusion or compromise by the stent deployed.
     Subsequently, the wire was withdrawn up to the middle cerebral artery location
     and the microcatheter  was then used to cross the interstices of the stent
     into the neck residual.  With the microcatheter in the aneurysm, residual
     series of GDC coils were advanced until they were clearly in contact with the
     stent interstices.  At this point, an angiographic run was performed in
     biplane and two dimensional rotational angiography which showed an excellent
     result.  The microcatheter was then withdrawn and a final angiographic run was
     performed in the biplane projection as well as one of the neck which showed no
     evidence of intimal injury to the carotid artery.  At this point, the guide
     catheter was withdrawn.  The patient was then awokened from anesthesia and
     transferred to the post anesthesia care unit in stable condition.
     
     RESULTS:  Persistent 4 mm pocket of the previously treated right middle
     cerebral aneurysm embolized using a combination of GDC coils and neuroform
     stent with an excellent angiographic result with no evidence of iatrogenic
     branch occlusion.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  Aneurysm recently coiled. New onset of seizure. 
     
     MRI OF THE BRAIN/MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) 4**]:
     
     TECHNIQUE:   Multiplanar T1 and T2W imaging of the brain was performed.  3D
     time of flight MRA of the Circle of [**Location (un) **] was performed. Multiplanar
     reformatted images and source image data were reviewed.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous CT scan, the most recent from
     [**2832-9-27**] and the angiogram of [**2833-3-8**].
     
     There is a large area of encephalomalacia involving the right middle cerebral
     arterial territory. There is residual hemosiderin and susceptibility artifact
     within the brain tissue in this location.  No extension of the infarction is
     evident. There is no diffusion signal abnormality to indicate recent
     infarction. There is enlargement of the right lateral ventricle. There is
     volume loss. The left lateral ventricles are not dilated. A left frontal
     ventricular catheter is present and extends across the midline, into the body
     of the right lateral ventricle. There is an old hemorrhagic tract from a left
     ventricular catheter in the left frontal lobes.  A few small foci of increased
     T2 signal are identified in the white matter bilaterally and may represent
     sites of microvascular infarction.
     
     The brain stem and cerebellum appear normal.
     
     Two coiled aneurysms are identified as areas with absent signal, one is just
     to the right of the right anterior communicating artery, and another is at the
     right middle cerebral arterial bifurcation. No flow signal is identified in
     these foci. There is diminished flow evident in the right A1 arterial segment
     and in the right middle cerebral arterial branches.  This is probably related
     to a combination of artifact from coils present and diminished flow related to
     old infarction.  The left internal carotid artery, anterior and middle
     cerebral arteries have normal flow signal.
     
     There is flow identified in the left vertebral artery which continues as the
     basilar artery. There is no flow signal in the expected location of the right
     vertebral artery.    Both posterior cerebral arteries are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  MRI of the brain reveals old hemorrhage and encephalomalacia involving the
                                                                 (Over)
