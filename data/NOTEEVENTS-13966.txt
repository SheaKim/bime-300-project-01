Admission Date:  [**2787-10-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2787-10-21**]

Date of Birth:   [**2713-6-12**]       Sex:  M

Service:  TRAUMA.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old man
with underlying dementia secondary to Alzheimer disease who
fell down the stairs on the day of admission resulting in
loss of consciousness.  Initially, he had mildly slurred
speech with mild word-finding difficulties.  He was brought
to the [**Hospital1 10**] by EMS, boarded
and collared.  At the time he had a GCS of 15.  He was
hemodynamically stable.  He was following commands without
any complaints.  He did have positive emesis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History is significant for Alzheimer.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  History is significant for status
post CABG times four in [**2779**].

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Prozac 40 mg p.o.q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denied any alcohol or tobacco
use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination in the emergency
department revealed that he was afebrile with a pulse in the
100 range and blood pressure of 160/palpable, saturation 98%.
He was alert and oriented with pupils equal, round, and
reactive to light going from 3 mm to 2 mm.  Tympanic
membranes were clear bilaterally.  Trachea was midline.
Lungs were clear to auscultation.  He had no tenderness or
stepoff on his chest.  His cardiac examination was regular.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Extremities
were warm and well perfused.  He was moving all four
extremities with gross sensory intact.  His pulse was stable.
Rectal was normal tone.  Back showed low lumbar tenderness,
no stepoffs.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was evaluated in the emergency
room and taken to the Department of Radiology, where he
underwent an emergency head CT, which showed a small
interparenchymal paraventricular hemorrhage on the right
without other significant lesions.  The patient also
underwent a T and L spine, which was negative, as well as a
C-spine, CT, which showed degenerative cervical spinal
changes.  His chest x-ray was without any pneumothorax or
hemothorax and his pelvis showed no fractures.  At this time,
he was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for every
one hour neurochecks and control of blood pressure and
further monitoring given his intracranial hemorrhage.

The patient spent two days in the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit, where he required a Nipride drip to control the blood
pressure, which was in the 60s to 200s systolic prior to the
initiation of the drip down to the 120s to 130s on Nipride.
He appeared to be doing well.  He underwent two subsequent CT
scans of his head on consecutive days, which demonstrated
stability of the paraventricular hemorrhage.  He was
transitioned from Nipride over to Lopressor for blood
pressure control.  He had a stable hematocrit, persistently
above 30, and he was transferred to the floor on [**10-20**].
He was a little confused requiring Haldol.  This was believed
to be secondary to recent head trauma, as well as his ICU
stay.  This condition resolved over the next couple of days.
He had an MR of his spine, which demonstrated no acute
ligamentous injuries, although, it was of poor quality
secondary to motion artifact.  His cervical spine was cleared
both radiographically and clinically without any tenderness
in the posterior midline.  At this time, it was felt that the
patient was stable for discharge.  At the time of discharge
he was following commands.  He was back to his baseline
mental status per the family.  He was tolerating a regular
diet.  His Foley was removed and he was able to void.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  The patient was discharged on the
following medications:
1.  Prozac 40 mg p.o.q.d.
2.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o.b.i.d.
3.  Tylenol p.r.n.

FOLLOW-UP CARE:  He was instructed to followup with the
Neurosurgical Clinic for a repeat MRI in one to two months.
The phone # for the Neurosurgical Clinic was listed as
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 524**].  He was also evaluated by his primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **] with whom he would also followup at
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1917**].  He was, otherwise, stable.

He was also discharged with a home-safety evaluation visiting
nursing association.












DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Alzheimer dementia.
2.  Status post closed-head injury.
3.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass grafting times four.
4.  Hypertension.

     HISTORY: Fall, rule out bleed.
     
     Unenhanced contiguous axial images were obtained from the skull base to the
     higer convexities.  No prior studies.
     
     There is a 12.2 x 8 mm hyperdense lesion in the subependymal lining of the
     right lateral ventricle at the level of the centrum semi ovale series two,
     image 16.
     
     The remaining brain parenchyma is normal in morphology and attenuation. The
     ventricles are normal in size and shape.  There is no other area of mass
     lesion, hemorrhage, or midline shift.  There is no abnormal extraaxial fluid
     collection.
     
     The globes, orbits and paranasal sinuses are normal.  The bony calvarium is
     intact.
     
     IMPRESSION: A hyperdense lesion in the subependymal region in the right
     ventricle adjacent to the centrum semi ovale that is an atypical location for
     a hemorrhage but given the patient's history should be considered.  Other less
     likely causes may be a hypercellular neoplastic process.
