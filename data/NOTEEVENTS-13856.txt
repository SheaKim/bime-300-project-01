Date of Birth:  [**2556-11-1**]        Sex:  F

Service:  CSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74 year-old
woman who has a history of a murmur, hypertension and aortic
stenosis who was undergoing a preoperative work up for a left
knee replacement and cardiac evaluation demonstrated
worsening of her aortic stenosis. She underwent cardiac
catheterization which confirmed an aortic valve area of 0.5
and two vessel coronary artery disease. She was evaluated by
the cardiac surgery team and she presents for elective aortic
valve replacement and coronary artery bypass graft.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies angina, shortness of [**Last Name (LF) 2868**],
[**First Name3 (LF) 3066**] on exertion, palpitations, syncope or edema.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension,
degenerative joint disease of the left knee, hypothyroidism
and aortic stenosis.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for bilateral cataract
removal.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Included atenolol 75 mg p.o. daily
and Synthroid 0.25 mg daily.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives [**Location 812**] with her husband. She
is retired. Denies tobacco or ETOH use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Is noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Overall is in good health. Denies any
respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurologic or
hematologic symptoms.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient is 4 foot 11 inches, 136
pounds, temperature is 97.7, heart rate is 68 and regular,
blood pressure 148/70, breathing 15, 98 percent on room air.
She is in no acute distress. Her neck has no carotid bruits,
no jugular venous distension. Heart is regular rate and
rhythm with a holosystolic ejection murmur with radiation to
the carotids. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen is soft and nontender. She has palpable distal
pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission included white count of 7.4,
hematocrit of 35, platelets of 305. BUN of 13, creatinine
0.6. The remainder of her laboratories are remarkable for an
AST of 46, ALT of 12, alkaline phosphatase of 90, total
bilirubin of 0.5, amylase of 108 and albumin of 3.9.
Preoperative chest x-ray demonstrated no congestion, no
infiltrate. A preoperative carotid series demonstrated a left
sided 60 to 69 percent carotid stenosis and a right sided 40
percent carotid stenosis. Cardiac catheterization done
[**2631-3-10**] demonstrated an aortic valve area of 0.5 cm sq, a
proximal right coronary artery that was diffusely diseased, a
mid right coronary artery that was diffusely diseased and a
distal right coronary artery that was diffusely diseased. The
proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and a 30
percent lesion, the mid left anterior descending coronary
artery an 80 percent lesion and diagonal 1 with 60 percent
lesion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient on the day of admission was
taken to the operating room where she underwent an aortic
valve replacement with a 19 mm paracardial Magna CE valve,
coronary artery bypass graft times on with left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary
artery. She tolerated the procedure well, postoperatively was
transferred to the cardiac surgery Intensive Care Unit. She
was extubated, weaned off the drips and transferred to the
floor on postoperative day #1. Postoperative #2 she remained
hemodynamically normal, afebrile, with benign examination and
her chest tubes were removed. On a follow up chest x-ray
there was evidence of free intraperitoneal air with no
pneumothorax. General surgery was consulted due to worry of
hollow viscous injury or diaphragmatic injury. Abdominal CT
scan was obtained with Gastrografin area and this
demonstrated extensive pneumoperitoneum but no evidence of
bowel perforation. A small left pneumothorax and
cholelithiasis with focal gallbladder wall calcifications and
stool throughout the colon. She was observed with serial
examinations, intravenous fluids and nothing by mouth. Her
examination remained benign and after 24 hours remaining
stable. Her diet was advanced which was tolerated and her
examination unchanged. She also continued to receive physical
therapy and at this point she is cleared to level 5
evaluation. Her white count has been monitored and is
currently 8.4. She has remained hemodynamically normal and
now is ready for discharge to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Aortic stenosis.
2. Coronary artery disease.
3. Postoperative pneumoperitoneum without evidence of hollow
   viscous injury.
4. Congestive heart failure.
5. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
6. Hypertension.


MAJOR SURGICAL INTERVENTIONS:  Aortic valve placement with a
19 mm pericardial CE Magna and coronary artery bypass graft
times one.

     HISTORY:  Status post aortic valve replacement and CABG, with development of
     pneumoperitoneum following chest tube removal.
     
     COMPARISON:  No previous abdominal CT.  Chest radiographs demonstrating
     pneumoperitoneum are available for correlation.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial multidetector CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained with oral contrast only.
     
     ABDOMEN CT WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is a small right pleural
     effusion and a tiny left pneumothorax.  There is air in the mediastinum. There
     is mild atelectasis at both lung bases.
     
     There is a large amount of free intraperitoneal air.  Oral contrast opacifies
     the stomach, duodenal, small bowel and colon.  There is no evidence of oral
     contrast extravasation or bowel wall thickening.  There is no free
     intraabdominal fluid.  The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and
     kidneys appear unremarkable on limited noncontrast evaluation.  There are
     stones in the gallbladder and a focal calcification in the gallbladder wall.
     
     PELVIS CT WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The bladder, uterus, and adnexa
     appear unremarkable.  There is a large amount of stool in the rectum, the
     inferior extent of which is not fully imaged.  There is no free fluid.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  The visualized osseous structures do not demonstrate any
     suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.  Degenerative changes are
     present in the lower lumbar spine.
     
     Findings were discussed with the surgical resident taking care of the patient

     CONTRAST:  Oral and intravenous nonionic contrast were administered due to the
     rapid rate of bolus injection required for this examination.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is a small left pleural
     effusion.  Bibasilar atelectasis.  Status post aortic valve repair.  The
     visualized portions of the heart and pericardium appear otherwise
     unremarkable.  The liver, atrophic pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands appear
     unchanged and unremarkable.  There are multiple calcified gallstones within
     the gallbladder without evidence of pericholecystic fluid.  There are
     symmetric nephrograms bilaterally.  Tiny, rounded, hypodense lesion within the
     inferior pole of the left kidney, too small to accurately characterize.
     Similar tiny, round, hypodense lesions are seen within upper poles of both
     kidneys.
     
     There is free air within the abdomen, located adjacent to the left lobe of the
     liver, and at multiple sites within the abdomen, anterior to the transverse
     colon.  There is a more focal area of extraluminal gas adjacent to a loop of
     inflamed sigmoid colon within the mid abdomen.  At the time of the previous
     scan, dated [**2631-5-5**], there was extensive pneumoperitoneum associated
     with the patient's surgery.  There is wall thickening and extensive stranding
     within a loop of sigmoid colon in the mid abdomen, and a gas containing fluid
     collection measuring 1.7 x 3.3 cm adjacent to this area. There are multiple
     small mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes.  There is a small amount of
     free fluid within the paracolic gutters bilaterally.

     demonstrates wall thickening and extensive surrounding stranding, and an
     associated fluid collection as described.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Bone windows demonstrate extensive degenerative changes of the
     thoracic and lumbosacral spine without evidence of suspicious lytic or
     sclerotic osseous lesions.
     
     MULTIPLANAR REFORMATS:  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images demonstrate
     extraluminal gas, and a thickened loop of sigmoid colon within the mid abdomen
     with extensive surrounding stranding.  A fluid collection containing gas
     adjacent to this loop of sigmoid colon is seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Markedly thickened sigmoid colon with surrounding stranding and fluid
     collection, findings that are consistent with diverticulitis with perforation.
     Pneumoperitoneum.  Of note, there was massive pneumoperitoneum one month ago
     associated with the patient's recent surgery.  However, in association with
     the changes in the bowel described, it is felt unlikely that the
     pneumoperitoneum represents residual air from the patient's postoperative
     state one month ago.
     2)  Gallstones.
     3)  Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
     4)  Tiny, rounded, hypodense lesions within both kidneys, too small to
     accurately characterize, but likely representing cysts.
     
     Results were called to the emergency department resident caring for the
     patient at the time of interpretation (5:30 a.m.).

     with extensive surrounding stranding.  A fluid collection containing gas
     adjacent to this loop of sigmoid colon is seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Markedly thickened sigmoid colon with surrounding stranding and fluid
     collection, findings that are consistent with diverticulitis with perforation.
     Pneumoperitoneum.  Of note, there was massive pneumoperitoneum one month ago
     associated with the patient's recent surgery.  However, in association with
     the changes in the bowel described, it is felt unlikely that the
     pneumoperitoneum represents residual air from the patient's postoperative
     state one month ago.
     2)  Gallstones.
     3)  Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
     4)  Tiny, rounded, hypodense lesions within both kidneys, too small to
     accurately characterize, but likely representing cysts.
     
     Results were called to the emergency department resident caring for the
     patient at the time of interpretation (5:30 a.m.).

     INDICATION:  74-year-old woman post-diverticulitis with an abdominal abscess,
     for drainage.
     
     PROCEDURE:  After the risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with
     the patient, informed consent was obtained.  A preprocedure timeout was
     obtained to confirm the identity of the patient and the procedure which she
     has to undergo.
     
     CT GUIDED DRAINAGE LOCALIZATION:  The patient was placed in a supine position
     and limited axial CT images of the abdomen were obtained to confirm the
     collection to be drained.  As in her prior scan from today, the collection is
     demonstrated in the midline to left lower abdomen.
     
     CT GUIDED DRAINAGE:  The patient's skin was prepped and draped in the usual
     sterile fashion and 1% lidocaine was used for local anesthesia.
     
     Under direct CT guidance, a 10-French self-locking pigtail catheter was
     inserted and deployed into the fluid collection.  Catheter position was
     confirmed using CT scanning.  The catheter was locked in position, secured to
     the skin with a percutaneous catheter fastener, and left open to drainage.
     Approximately 50 cc of brown fecal like fluid were aspirated and a sample was
     sent for culture and Gram stain.  A post-procedure scan confirmed again the
     catheter position and no complications.
     
     Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 567**], attending radiologist, was present and supervising the entire
     procedure.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate
     complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Technically successful drainage of an abdominal fluid collection.

     COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis [**2631-6-4**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial multidetector CT images were obtained from the lung bases to
     the pubic symphysis following the administration 150 cc of intravenous Optiray
     non-ionic contrast.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  Since the prior exam, there has been
     interval increase in the size of the bilateral pleural effusions.  Associated
     compressive atelectasis is noted of both lower lung lobes.  The heart and
     pericardium are unremarkable.  The liver, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands are
     unremarkable.  Again noted are multiple calcified gallstones within the
     gallbladder without evidence of cholecystitis.  The kidneys enhance and
     excrete contrast symmetrically.  There is an increased amount of perihepatic
     ascites as well as new ascites within the left pericolic gutter.  There has
     been interval decrease in the amount of intra-abdominal free air.
     
     Since the prior exam, there has been a progressive increase in size of the
     large left lower quadrant fluid collection associated with the sigmoid colon,
     which now measures 10 cm x 3 cm, and previously measured 1.7 cm x 3 cm.  There
     has been interval maturation of this collection which now displays a thin wall
     with rim enhancement.  There has been interval increase in the amount of fluid
     within this collection.  The collection abuts but does not appear to have
     discrete continuity with the sigmoid colon lumen.  Again noted are multiple
     small mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The bladder, distal ureters, and rectum, as
     well as the uterus and adnexa are unremarkable.  Again, the sigmoid colon
     demonstrates wall thickening, surrounding mesenteric fat stranding, and the

     INDICATION:  74-year-old woman with diverticulitis.  Please evaluate post-
     treatment.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis [**2631-6-4**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial multidetector CT images were obtained from the lung bases to
     the pubic symphysis following the administration 150 cc of intravenous Optiray
     non-ionic contrast.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  Since the prior exam, there has been
     interval increase in the size of the bilateral pleural effusions.  Associated
     compressive atelectasis is noted of both lower lung lobes.  The heart and
     pericardium are unremarkable.  The liver, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands are
     unremarkable.  Again noted are multiple calcified gallstones within the
     gallbladder without evidence of cholecystitis.  The kidneys enhance and
     excrete contrast symmetrically.  There is an increased amount of perihepatic
     ascites as well as new ascites within the left pericolic gutter.  There has
     been interval decrease in the amount of intra-abdominal free air.
     
     Since the prior exam, there has been a progressive increase in size of the
     large left lower quadrant fluid collection associated with the sigmoid colon,
     which now measures 10 cm x 3 cm, and previously measured 1.7 cm x 3 cm.  There
     has been interval maturation of this collection which now displays a thin wall
     with rim enhancement.  There has been interval increase in the amount of fluid
     within this collection.  The collection abuts but does not appear to have
     discrete continuity with the sigmoid colon lumen.  Again noted are multiple
     small mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The bladder, distal ureters, and rectum, as
     well as the uterus and adnexa are unremarkable.  Again, the sigmoid colon
     demonstrates wall thickening, surrounding mesenteric fat stranding, and the
     associated fluid collection as described above. Bilateral inguinal fat
     containing hernias are again noted.   
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Again seen are degenerative changes within the thoracolumbar
     spine, without suspicious lytic or blastic osseous lesions.

     INDICATION:  74-year-old woman post-diverticulitis with an abdominal abscess,
     for drainage.
     
     PROCEDURE:  After the risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with
     the patient, informed consent was obtained.  A preprocedure timeout was
     obtained to confirm the identity of the patient and the procedure which she
     has to undergo.
     
     CT GUIDED DRAINAGE LOCALIZATION:  The patient was placed in a supine position
     and limited axial CT images of the abdomen were obtained to confirm the
     collection to be drained.  As in her prior scan from today, the collection is
     demonstrated in the midline to left lower abdomen.
     
     CT GUIDED DRAINAGE:  The patient's skin was prepped and draped in the usual
     sterile fashion and 1% lidocaine was used for local anesthesia.
     
     Under direct CT guidance, a 10-French self-locking pigtail catheter was
     inserted and deployed into the fluid collection.  Catheter position was
     confirmed using CT scanning.  The catheter was locked in position, secured to
     the skin with a percutaneous catheter fastener, and left open to drainage.
     Approximately 50 cc of brown fecal like fluid were aspirated and a sample was
     sent for culture and Gram stain.  A post-procedure scan confirmed again the
     catheter position and no complications.
     
     Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 567**], attending radiologist, was present and supervising the entire
     procedure.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate
     complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Technically successful drainage of an abdominal fluid collection.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  74-year-old female with diverticulitis and symptomatic
     improvement after drainage of an abscess within the left abdomen.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis performed without intravenous
     contrast.  Approximately 25 cc of dilute intravenous contrast was injected via
     the patient's percutaneous drainage catheter into the pre-existing abscess
     cavity.  Additional post-injection CT imaging was also performed.
     
     FINDINGS:  Pre-injection imaging shows small bilateral pleural effusions
     (right greater than left) with associated atelectasis.  The liver, spleen,
     pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable on this study limited
     by the lack of IV contrast.  Oral contrast is present within the colon. A
     percutaneous drainage catheter is present within the left anterior peritoneum
     with a minimal residual fluid collection containing air adjacent to the
     drainage catheter measuring 3 cm in greatest dimension.  The fluid collection
     prior to abscess drainage measured 10 x 3 cm.  After injection of
     approximately 25 cc of dilute contrast, no definite communication was
     identified between this residual fluid collection and bowel.  Delayed images
     show spillage of this injected contrast into the peritoneal cavity.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Air is present within the urinary bladder
     likely reflecting prior instrumentation.  The postmenopausal uterus, adnexa,
     and rectum are within normal limits.  There are diverticula within the colon
     with evidence of wall thickening adjacent to the patient's site of known
     diverticulitis.
     
     Bone windows show no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Marked dimininution of drained abscess with minimal residual fluid
     collection (3 x 1 cm in greatest dimension) around the percutaneous drainage
     catheter. No communication between this cavity and bowel.
     Abscessogram showed potential cavity expansion.
     Following the injection of dilute intravenous contrast(25 ccs of 10% optiray),
     there was spillage into the peritoneal cavity. The patient was asymptomatic
     throughout the procedure.
     
     2)  Wall thickening/stranding associated with the patient's known region of
                                                                 (Over)

     (right greater than left) with associated atelectasis.  The liver, spleen,
     pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable on this study limited
     by the lack of IV contrast.  Oral contrast is present within the colon. A
     percutaneous drainage catheter is present within the left anterior peritoneum
     with a minimal residual fluid collection containing air adjacent to the
     drainage catheter measuring 3 cm in greatest dimension.  The fluid collection
     prior to abscess drainage measured 10 x 3 cm.  After injection of
     approximately 25 cc of dilute contrast, no definite communication was
     identified between this residual fluid collection and bowel.  Delayed images
     show spillage of this injected contrast into the peritoneal cavity.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Air is present within the urinary bladder
     likely reflecting prior instrumentation.  The postmenopausal uterus, adnexa,
     and rectum are within normal limits.  There are diverticula within the colon
     with evidence of wall thickening adjacent to the patient's site of known
     diverticulitis.
     
     Bone windows show no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Marked dimininution of drained abscess with minimal residual fluid
     collection (3 x 1 cm in greatest dimension) around the percutaneous drainage
     catheter. No communication between this cavity and bowel.
     Abscessogram showed potential cavity expansion.
     Following the injection of dilute intravenous contrast(25 ccs of 10% optiray),
     there was spillage into the peritoneal cavity. The patient was asymptomatic
     throughout the procedure.
     
     2)  Wall thickening/stranding associated with the patient's known region of
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  74-year-old woman with diverticulitis.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis [**2631-6-11**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases to the pubic symphysis with contrast.  Delayed phase images through
     the pelvis were also obtained.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There has been interval improvement of the
     right pleural effusion, and near resolution of the left pleural effusion.
     There is minimal atelectasis at the right lung base.  No lung nodules are
     identified.  There is evidence of prior median sternotomy and coronary artery
     calcifications are identified.  There is a small hiatal hernia.  The liver,
     spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable.  The
     gallbladder contains a large lamellated gallstone, but there is no evidence
     for cholecystitis.  The intra-abdominal loops of small bowel are unremarkable.
     Again, the pigtail drainage catheter is seen entering the left mid abdomen.
     There remains minimal stranding surrounding the pigtail catheter.  There is a
     residual 4.1 x 1.5 cm intra-abdominal collection containing a small amount of
     fluid and air.  This is much smaller than on the previous scan, and is not
     amenable to drainage.  This collection is adjacent to the proximal sigmoid
     colon.  Again, there is minimal inflammatory stranding within the mesentery
     about this collection, and along the catheter tract within the abdomen.  There
     are multiple small, non-pathologically enlarged lymph nodes within the
     mesentery.  There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  There is no free
     fluid within the pelvis.  Along the anterior left abdominal wall is likely
     injection inflammatory reaction.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The rectum, distal ureters, bladder, uterus,
     and adnexa are unremarkable.  The intrapelvic loops of small bowel appear
     normal.  There is no pathologically enlarged inguinal or pelvic
     lymphadenopathy.  There are small bilateral fat-containing femoral hernias.
     There is no free fluid within the pelvis.

     INDICATION:  History of prior perforated sigmoid colon, now presenting for
     followup.
     
     COMPARISON:  Study from [**2631-6-16**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung
     bases to the pubic symphysis with coronal and sagittal reconstructions.
     
     CONTRAST:  Oral contrast and 150 cc of IV Optiray contrast were administered
     due to the rapid rate of bolus injection required for the study.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Minimal atelectasis is noted at the lung
     bases bilaterally.  No parenchymal consolidation, pulmonary nodules, pleural
     effusion is seen.  The liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas are normal
     in appearance.  Multiple tiny hypodensities are seen within the left kidney,
     which are too small to characterize.  The right kidney is normal.  Large
     gallstones are again noted within the gallbladder, without any evidence of
     gallbladder wall thickening or edema.  No pathologically enlarged
     retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy is identified.  The bowel is
     normal in appearance, without any evidence of bowel wall thickening or
     dilatation.  No free fluid or free air is identified.  There has been interval
     removal of a drain, which was seen on the prior exam.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The uterus and bladder are normal in
     appearance.  Bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy is noted.  In the area of
     prior diverticulitis, there is persistent minimal stranding, which appears to
     have decreased in comparison to prior study.  Additionally, in the area of the
     sigmoid colon, there is a focal pocket of air which may represent a sinus
     within the wall of the colon in that area.  No free fluid is identified.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were essential in
     evaluating the anatomy and pathology.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  There is an interval decrease in the degree of stranding in comparison to
     the prior study in the area of previous diverticulitis.  There is a small
     persistent area of stranding adjacent to the sigmoid colon.  Additionally, in
     the wall of the sigmoid colon at the area of prior inflammation, there is a
     focal pocket of air within the wall, likely representing a sinus within the
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  History of prior perforated sigmoid colon, now presenting for
     followup.
     
     COMPARISON:  Study from [**2631-6-16**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung
     bases to the pubic symphysis with coronal and sagittal reconstructions.
     
     CONTRAST:  Oral contrast and 150 cc of IV Optiray contrast were administered
     due to the rapid rate of bolus injection required for the study.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Minimal atelectasis is noted at the lung
     bases bilaterally.  No parenchymal consolidation, pulmonary nodules, pleural
     effusion is seen.  The liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas are normal
     in appearance.  Multiple tiny hypodensities are seen within the left kidney,
     which are too small to characterize.  The right kidney is normal.  Large
     gallstones are again noted within the gallbladder, without any evidence of
     gallbladder wall thickening or edema.  No pathologically enlarged
     retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy is identified.  The bowel is
     normal in appearance, without any evidence of bowel wall thickening or
     dilatation.  No free fluid or free air is identified.  There has been interval
     removal of a drain, which was seen on the prior exam.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The uterus and bladder are normal in
     appearance.  Bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy is noted.  In the area of
     prior diverticulitis, there is persistent minimal stranding, which appears to
     have decreased in comparison to prior study.  Additionally, in the area of the
     sigmoid colon, there is a focal pocket of air which may represent a sinus
     within the wall of the colon in that area.  No free fluid is identified.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were essential in
     evaluating the anatomy and pathology.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  There is an interval decrease in the degree of stranding in comparison to
     the prior study in the area of previous diverticulitis.  There is a small
     persistent area of stranding adjacent to the sigmoid colon.  Additionally, in
     the wall of the sigmoid colon at the area of prior inflammation, there is a
     focal pocket of air within the wall, likely representing a sinus within the

   Await family's decision re: patient's care
   Continue to monitor pulses & maintain in arterial position if possible. Watch for color changes/S&S necrosis/ lack of pain from no perfusion.
   Watch for increased ectopy, increased HR, decreased BP.
