neutrophils, 9% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, 0% eosinophils.
ALT was 9, AST was 25, amylase 37, lipase 12, total bilirubin
was 0.6.

ECG on admission was unchanged from her prior
hospitalization.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was initially admitted to the
Blumgart Medicine Service.  Her hospital course will be
reviewed by system.

1.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Patient was started on a two week
course of Vancomycin for cellulitis of her left upper
extremity.  Her Vancomycin was dosed based on levels.  She
completed her two week course on [**12-18**].

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  A - Coronary artery disease.  Patient is
status post myocardial infarction in [**3467-9-22**] with
subsequently cardiac catheterization and LAD stent.  On
[**12-5**], the patient developed substernal chest pain
and hemodialysis.  An ECG was done which disclosed
significant changes.  There were ST segment elevations in V2
through V4, ST segment depressions in II, III and aVF.

The patient was emergently taken to the Cath Lab for
intervention.  Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated
right and left sided filling pressures.  There was a V wave
dominance in the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure tracing.
......... saturation was elevated with a difference in the
SVC to IVC and saturations all consistent with known AV
fistula in the left arm.  There is severe systemic arterial
hypertension and moderate to moderate pulmonary artery
hypertension.

Selective coronary angiography of the right dominant
circulation demonstrated a proximal LAD culprit lesion.  The
LAD had a 99% instant restenosis with distal TIMI II flow.
Successful PTCA of the proximal LAD was performed using a
cutting balloon.  There was 20% residual stenosis, normal
flow and no apparent dissection.

On the following day the patient underwent brachytherapy.
She was transferred to the CCU for management following her
catheterization.  She was administered aspirin, Plavix, beta
blocker and Statin.

B - Pump:  Patient has hypertension.  She continued on beta
blocker and was administered Norvasc and ACE inhibitor. A TTE
done on [**12-11**] following her MI showed an ejection
fraction of 60%.  There was mild symmetric LVH.

C - Rhythm:  Patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation.  She continued on her Amiodarone and beta
blocker.  She was monitored on Telemetry.  She is currently
being restarted on her Coumadin with Lovenox as a bridge to
Coumadin.

3.  NEUROLOGIC:  Patient has a history of CVA in [**3463**], [**3464**]
and 2000.  She has left sided residual weakness.  Following
her cardiac catheterization, the family noted that the
patient was demonstrating mental status changes.  A MRI done
on [**12-9**] disclosed a large subacute infarct involving
the left parietal lobe.  The stroke was believed to be
initially ischemia with hemorrhagic conversion.

The patient was seen by the Stroke Service who evaluated her
and ultimately recommended that she be administered Coumadin
due to her history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Following her stroke, the patient had demonstrated swallowing
deficits on the swallow evaluation.  In addition, she showed
some right sided weakness which has improved over this
admission.  A carotid duplex ultrasound disclosed 60 to 69%
laminal stenosis at the origin of the right internal carotid
artery.  The patient has been started on Coumadin with
Lovenox as a bridge to Coumadin due to her history of
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

4.  RENAL:  Patient has end stage renal disease secondary to
diabetes mellitus complicated by contrast nephropathy.  She
undergoes hemodialysis three times a week.  She is
administered Phos-Lo three tablets t.i.d. with meals.  Her
nephrologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2737**].  A fistulogram done on
[**12-17**] demonstrated a patent AV fistula.

5.  FLUIDS, NUTRITION AND ELECTROLYTES / GI:  As noted above,
the patient underwent a swallow evaluation on [**12-11**].
She failed this evaluation and it was recommended that she be
NPO with tube feeds.  Patient initially received tube feeds
and medications per NG tube.  On [**12-17**], a PEG was
placed.  Patient is currently being administered tube feeds.
Her goal tube feeds are Nepro at 35 cc an hour plus 25 grams
of ProMod per day.  This will give her 1788 kilocalories and
78 grams of protein per day. The Nutrition Service has
suggested that the patient be administered Nephrocaps and her
phosphate should be monitored.

In addition, the patient has chronic constipation.  A
colonoscopy in the past demonstrated melanosis coli.  The
patient has continued on her bowel regimen with Senna, Colace
and Lactulose p.r.n.

6.   ENDOCRINE:  Patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Her
fingersticks were monitored q.i.d..  She was administered
regular insulin sliding scale and fixed dose insulin 7 units
NPH q. AM, 3 units NPH q. PM.

7.  VASCULATURE:  On [**12-8**] following the patient's
cardiac catheterization, it was noted that she had a right
femoral artery pseudoaneurysm.  On [**12-9**], the patient
underwent thrombin injection to that site.  On
[**12-10**] a repeat ultrasound was done which confirmed
thrombosis of the right groin and pseudoaneurysm.

The patient also had Doppler ultrasound of the lower
extremities done during this hospital which disclosed no
evidence of deep venous thrombosis.

CODE STATUS:  The patient is full code.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Myocardial infarction status post cardiac catheterization
and intervention with balloon thrombectomy and brachytherapy
to instant restenosis of LAD stent.
2.  End stage renal disease secondary to diabetic
nephropathy.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.
6.  Cerebrovascular accident.

     MRI OF THE BRAIN WITH DIFFUSION AND MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **].
     
     INDICATION:  Hypertension, ?infarct.
     
     Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging of the brain, in addition to diffusion
     images were performed.  3D TOF MRA of the intracranial circulation was
     obtained.
     
     Correlation is made to the recent CT examination from [**3467-12-7**].  There is a
     moderate-sized area of restricted diffusion involving the left frontoparietal
     lobe along the parietal division of the left MCA suggestive of subacute
     infarction.  There is mild surrounding cytotoxic edema present and mass effect
     on the left lateral ventricle.  Byproducts of blood are seen on susceptibility
     images.  Chronic microvascular ischemic changes are seen within the
     periventricular white matter.  The images were overall degraded by motion
     artifact.  Scattered small lacunar infarcts are seen within the basal ganglia.
      Generalized atrophy is noted.
     
     MRA of the intracranial circulation was degraded by motion artifact.  No
     abnormalities are seen involving the distal vertebrobasilar circulation.  The
     visualized anterior and middle cerebral arteries are patent.  There is
     attenuation of flow along the distal MCA branches within the left parietal
     lobe most likely due to the presence of the infarct.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Large subacute infarct involving the left parietal lobe seen on diffusion
     images and surrounded by mild edema.
     
     2) Chronic microvascular ischemic changes within the periventricular white
     matter and to a lesser degree the brain stem.
     
     3) Images of the MRA were degraded by motion artifact.  There is mild
     attenuation of flow along the parietal MCA branches probably related to the
     presence of the infarct.  Further clinical correlation and follow-up are
     recommended.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     HISTORY:  Pseudoaneurysm with cardiac catheterization.
     
     TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  Initial ultrasound of the right inguinal area
     demonstrates a multiloculated/multilobular pseudoaneurysm measuring a maximum
     of 6 cm in diameter.  This appears to be arising off the common femoral
     artery.
     
     After discussion of the technique, risk and benefits with the husband, and
     with the son by phone, the right inguinal area was prepped and draped in a
     sterile fashion.  A 21 g. spinal needle was advanced into the periphery of the
     main, large lobe of this patient's pseudoaneurysm.  The location was
     documented with ultrasound.  Approximately 700 units of topical Thrombin was
     injected with thrombosis of approximately 90% of the PSA, including the
     remaining peripheral compartments of this PSA.
     
     Scanning demonstrated some persistent flow within a small portion of the
     pseudoaneurysm, more inferior.  Hence, the needle was redirected and another
     200 units injected, with complete thrombosis.
     
     The patient suffered no untoward complications, the peripheral exam was
     unchanged.  She was sent back to her room in stable condition.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Complicated large right inguinal pseudoaneurysm, successfully
     treated with approximately 1000 units of topical Thrombin without
     complication.

     MRI OF THE BRAIN WITH DIFFUSION AND MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **].
     
     INDICATION:  Hypertension, ?infarct.
     
     Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging of the brain, in addition to diffusion
     images were performed.  3D TOF MRA of the intracranial circulation was
     obtained.
     
     Correlation is made to the recent CT examination from [**3467-12-7**].  There is a
     moderate-sized area of restricted diffusion involving the left frontoparietal
     lobe along the parietal division of the left MCA suggestive of subacute
     infarction.  There is mild surrounding cytotoxic edema present and mass effect
     on the left lateral ventricle.  Byproducts of blood are seen on susceptibility
     images.  Chronic microvascular ischemic changes are seen within the
     periventricular white matter.  The images were overall degraded by motion
     artifact.  Scattered small lacunar infarcts are seen within the basal ganglia.
      Generalized atrophy is noted.
     
     MRA of the intracranial circulation was degraded by motion artifact.  No
     abnormalities are seen involving the distal vertebrobasilar circulation.  The
     visualized anterior and middle cerebral arteries are patent.  There is
     attenuation of flow along the distal MCA branches within the left parietal
     lobe most likely due to the presence of the infarct.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Large subacute infarct involving the left parietal lobe seen on diffusion
     images and surrounded by mild edema.
     
     2) Chronic microvascular ischemic changes within the periventricular white
     matter and to a lesser degree the brain stem.
     
     3) Images of the MRA were degraded by motion artifact.  There is mild
     attenuation of flow along the parietal MCA branches probably related to the
     presence of the infarct.  Further clinical correlation and follow-up are
     recommended.

     INDICATION: Follow-up examination in a 69 year old woman with history of
     cardiac catheterization and acute myocardial infarction, complicated by a
     right groin pseudoaneurysm which was treated by percutaneous thrombin
     injection yesterday. Also, history of end-stage renal disease and status post
     cerebrovascular accident.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler examinations of the right
     groin were performed, demonstrating the absence of flow in the known
     pseudoaneurysm in the right groin.
     
     [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale, color Doppler and spectral Doppler examinations were also
     performed at the level of the cervical portions of the bilateral carotid and
     vertebral arteries.
     
     On the right, there is plaque at the origin of the internal and external
     carotid arteries. The peak systolic velocities in the internal, common and
     external carotid arteries are 171, 59 and 73 cm/sec, respectively. The right
     ICA-to-CCA ratio is 2.89. These findings are consistent with the presence of a
     luminal narrowing between 60 and 69% in diameter. There is antegrade flow in
     the right vertebral artery with a peak systolic velocity of 61 cm/sec.
     
     On the left, there is also plaque at the origin of the left internal carotid
     artery. The peak systolic velocities in the internal, common and external
     carotid arteries are 80, 81 and 98 cm/sec, respectively. The left ICA-to-CCA
     ratio is 0.98. There is antegrade flow in the left vertebral artery, with a
     peak systolic velocity of 57 cm/sec.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     1) Confirmation of thrombosis of the right groin pseudoaneurysm.
     
     2) 60-69% luminal stenosis at the origin of the right internal carotid artery.

     HISTORY:  A 69 year old female with end-sage renal disease and recent CVA and
     cardiac arrest.  At significant risk for aspiration, needs a GJ-tube for long
     term feeding.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2256**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 450**], [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 511**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and
     [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 127**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2595**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2595**], the staff radiologist, was present and
     supervised the entire procedure.
     
     MEDICATIONS AND CONTRAST:  0.5 mg IV Versed, 25 ug IV Fentanyl administered in
     divided doses under constant hemodynamic monitoring.  3 cc of 1% subcutaneous
     Lidocaine.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND PROCEDURE:  The patient's son was informed of the details and
     associated risks of the procedure and verbal consent was obtained via
     telephone.  The patient was placed on the  angiographic table and the
     epigastrium was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The
     stomach was then insuflated via the nasogastric tube.  Under fluoroscopic
     guidance, 19 gauge introducer needles were used to access the stomach and the
     stomach wall was approximated to the abdominal cavity wall with two T
     fasteners.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, an introducer needle was inserted
     into the body of the stomach between the T fasteners.  A 0.035 [**Location (un) 7663**] J-wire
     was then introduced through the needle and the needle was subsequently
     exchanged for a 7 French sheath and MP catheter.  After multiple attempts at
     advancing the guide wire into the duodenum, the J-wire was exchanged for a
     super stiff glide wire.  The stiff glide wire was then advanced past the
     pylorus and into the proximal jejunum.  The catheter was then advanced over
     the wire until the tip was positioned within the distal duodenum.  The glide
     wire was then exchanged for an Amplatz wire with the tip positioned within the
     proximal jejunum.  The sheath and MP catheter were exchanged over the wire for
     serial 8, 10, and 12 French dilators.  A 14 French peel-away sheath was then
     inserted over the Amplatz wire so that the tip was in the mid-duodenum.  A 14
     French [**Doctor Last Name 217**] gastrojejunostomy catheter was then advanced over the Amplatz
     wire under fluoroscopic guidance so that the tip was within the jejunum and
     the pigtail was then formed.  The peel-away sheath was removed.  Abdominal

     HISTORY:  A 69 year old female with end-sage renal disease and recent CVA and
     cardiac arrest.  At significant risk for aspiration, needs a GJ-tube for long
     term feeding.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2256**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 450**], [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 511**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and
     [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 127**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2595**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2595**], the staff radiologist, was present and
     supervised the entire procedure.
     
     MEDICATIONS AND CONTRAST:  0.5 mg IV Versed, 25 ug IV Fentanyl administered in
     divided doses under constant hemodynamic monitoring.  3 cc of 1% subcutaneous
     Lidocaine.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND PROCEDURE:  The patient's son was informed of the details and
     associated risks of the procedure and verbal consent was obtained via
     telephone.  The patient was placed on the  angiographic table and the
     epigastrium was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The
     stomach was then insuflated via the nasogastric tube.  Under fluoroscopic
     guidance, 19 gauge introducer needles were used to access the stomach and the
     stomach wall was approximated to the abdominal cavity wall with two T
     fasteners.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, an introducer needle was inserted
     into the body of the stomach between the T fasteners.  A 0.035 [**Location (un) 7663**] J-wire
     was then introduced through the needle and the needle was subsequently
     exchanged for a 7 French sheath and MP catheter.  After multiple attempts at
     advancing the guide wire into the duodenum, the J-wire was exchanged for a
     super stiff glide wire.  The stiff glide wire was then advanced past the
     pylorus and into the proximal jejunum.  The catheter was then advanced over
     the wire until the tip was positioned within the distal duodenum.  The glide
     wire was then exchanged for an Amplatz wire with the tip positioned within the
     proximal jejunum.  The sheath and MP catheter were exchanged over the wire for
     serial 8, 10, and 12 French dilators.  A 14 French peel-away sheath was then
     inserted over the Amplatz wire so that the tip was in the mid-duodenum.  A 14
     French [**Doctor Last Name 217**] gastrojejunostomy catheter was then advanced over the Amplatz
     wire under fluoroscopic guidance so that the tip was within the jejunum and
     the pigtail was then formed.  The peel-away sheath was removed.  Abdominal
     radiograph following the administration of 15 cc of ionic contrast
     demonstrates the tip of the catheter to be within the proximal jejunum.  The
     catheter was then secured to the skin with a Flexi-Trak.
     
     There were no immediate post-procedural complications and the patient
     tolerated the procedure well.

     radiograph following the administration of 15 cc of ionic contrast
     demonstrates the tip of the catheter to be within the proximal jejunum.  The

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: 69 year old female with end stage renal disease and creation of left
     arm AV fistula in last August.The fistula was dysfunctional.  Evaluation of AV
     fistula maturation is requested.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 511**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 131**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 126**] with
     the attending radiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 126**] supervising.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: The risks and benefits were explained to the patient
     through a translator and consent was obtained.
     
     The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table and the left arm was
     prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Under local anesthesia using 1%
     lidocaine, the left cephalic vein just above the elbow and beyond the AV
     anastomosis was accessed with a 21 gauge needle.  A 0.018 wire was placed
     through the needle into the cephalic vein.  The needle was exchanged for a 4
     french micropuncture sheath pointing to the venous side.  Sequential venograms
     were performed from the elbow to SVC using nonionic contrast.Since the tip was
     in a sidebranch the dilator was pulled more proximally and a pressure cuff was
     insufflated on the left upper arm proximal to the sheath and the venogram was
     repeated to produce reflux through the AV anastomosis into the artery.  At the
     end of the procedure the sheath was removed and local hemostasis was achieved
     by manual compression.
     
     The venograms demonstrated a patent left cephalic-brachial end-to-side AV
     anastomosis. The vein segment immediately distal to the anastomosis has a
     relative smaller lumen than the remainder of the cephalic vein but has no
     cliber jump as compared to the artery. Th hemodynamic significance is unkown.
     Since there is a good thrill in the graft it is likely not significant. The
     cephalic vein is moderately hypertrophic and patent through its entire course.
     At the region of the left axilla, the cephalic vein divided into two smaller
     branches, one joined the axillary vein and the other one connected to the left
     internal jugular vein, both with no aparent stenosis. The left basilic vein
     was also opacified through the connecting superficial veins and is widely
     open. The left subclavian, brachiocephalic veins and SVC were patent with no
     stenosis or filling defect.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     branch that we had entered with the tip of our dilator was accessed giving
     the faulty impression of a venous stenosis. This sidebrnach is very close to
     the main cephalic vein and can be avoided if punctures are done higher in the
     upper arm.

     FINDINGS:  Ther is a left frontoparietal region hemorrhagic infarction,
     identified on the MRI of [**3467-12-9**]. Edema produces mass effect narrowing the
     adjacent sulci and mildly shifting the midline stuructures to the right. There
     is compression of the left lateral ventricle. The edema has increased since
     the prior examination.  The right ventricle which was mildly dilated on the
     prior study, is probably unchanged. The basal cisterns are well visualized.
     Again noted are periventricular white matter hypodensities consistent with
     small vessel ischemic changes.  The right pontine lacunar infarct is not well
     appreciated.
     
     There are no skull fractures seen.  There is an air-fluid level or area of
     mucosal thickening seen in the left sphenoid sinus which is unchanged.  Again
     noted is an area of sclerosis/hypopneumatization in the mastoid air cells
     unchanged from prior.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Left frontoparietal hemorrhagic infarction with increased edema and mass
     effect since the prior exam of [**3467-12-9**].

NEURO-head CT revealed a massive bleed on R side with midline shift.during her stay in the EW her mental status decreased, and she now has no spontaneous movements.? herniation.pupils are reactive to light.was tx with 1 gm dilantin in EW.
RESP-due to extensive head bleed decision was made not to intubate pt.she is wearing a cool neb 100%.RR is ~[**11-5**].lungs are pretty clear.
GI-belly is soft with positive bowel sounds.has a PEG in place.pt is NPO.
F/E-has ESRD, ? when last dialysis was.no maintainence fluid infusing.mucous membranes are moist.please see labs as listed in CCC.
had a foley placed, draining clear yellow urine.
SKIN-has extensive bruising R groin due to recent cardiac cath.also, L groin had a line placed in the EW-up here it was noted to have a large
