Cardiac cath [**3264-1-16**]: FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Two vessel coronary 
artery disease. 2. Normal left ventricular systolic function. 3. 
PCI of LAD with Taxus stents. 4. Left renal artery stenosis. 
COMMENTS: 1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated two 
vessel coronary artery disease in this right dominant 
circulation. The LMCA was without angiographically apparent flow 
limiting disease. The LAD was heavily calcified with eccentric 
disease in the mid vessel up to 90% stenosis and 80% stenosis 
distally. The LCX was a large vessel with a large bifurcating 
OM1 that supplied extensive collaterals to the RCA. The OM2 was 
without flow limiting disease. The RCA was a dominant vessel 
with a total occlusion proximally. The distal RCA filled well 
via left to right collaterals. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics 
revealed normal left sided filling pressures (LVEDP=11mmHg). 
There was severe systemic hypertension present. No transaortic 
gradient seen on catheter pullback from left ventricle to 
ascending aorta. 3. Left ventriculogram revealed normal wall 
motion and preserved systolic function (LVEF=65%). No mitral 
regurgitation seen. 4. Selective renal angiography demonstrated 
a high grade (70-80%) proximal left renal artery stenosis. 5. 
Patient was electively intubated for airway protection. 6. 
Successful PCI of the proximal and mid-LAD with rotational 
atherectomy with a 1.5 mm burr, followed by PTCA and stenting 
with three overlapping Taxus DES (3.0 x 16 mm, 2.5 x 24 mm 
(post-dilated to 3.0 mm), and 2.5 x 16 mm).
.
Echo [**3264-1-17**]: LVEF 55-60%. The left atrium is elongated. There 
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. There is mild 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed. Resting 
regional wall motion abnormalities include distal anterior 
septum and apical hypokinesis with otherwise preserved LV 
systolic function. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-14**]+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow 
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There  
is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, 
though a  
loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.  
.
CXR [**3264-1-17**]: Some bibasilar atelectasis is seen. Otherwise, no 
acute cardiopulmonary process is identified.
.
ECG [**3264-1-18**]: Sinus rhythm. A-V conduction delay. Left atrial 
enlargement. Right bundle-branch block. Left anterior fascicular 
block. The T wave inversion recorded in leads V1-V5 exceedes 
that, in association with right bundle-branch block consistent 
with active anterolateral ischemic process and/or myocardial 
infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of [**3264-1-17**] the rate 
is increased. Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change. 
.
Head CT [**3264-1-19**]: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or 
fracture.
.
Bilateral hip XR [**3264-1-20**]: No evidence of fracture.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: A 79yoF with CAD, DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia transferred from 
OSH for catheterization after being found down (syncopal event), 
now s/p rotablation/DESs to LAD.
.
This Pt. had multiple CAD risk factors including diabetes, HTN, 
former tobacco use, and hyperlipidemia. The Pt. underwent PCI 
for NSTEMI (peak CK=617) on [**3264-1-16**], with successful 
rotablation and DESs to LAD lesions. The Pt. was electively 
intubated for the procedure due to agitation, and was extubated 
prior to arrival in the CCU.  The Pt. was monitored on telemetry 
with no significant events recorded.  The Pt. was continued on 
ASA, plavix (she will take this for 9 months), statin, 
beta-blocker and ACE-i.  A TTE revealed a preserved LVEF.  The 
Pt. was euvolemic on exam.
.
The Pt. was initially quite hypertensive, with SBP>200.  A 
nitroglycerin drip was used, and was transitioned to her home 
antihypertensives, when Pt. was tolerating PO.  The Pt. was 
noted to have a wide pulse pressure, with SBPs in the 160-170s 
and DBPs in the 30-40s.  This finding is likely secondary to 
calcification of her arteries.  
.
The Pt. was agitated on admission to the CCU, and remained so 
during the first night following admission.  The Pt. required 
haldol for agitation and was placed in 2-point limb restraints 
for several hours due to pulling at lines.  The patient was 
noted to be quite disoriented for the first several days of 
admission, and her speech was slowed.  Of note, the Pt. did not 
receive aricept for the first three days of admission; this was 
restarted.  According to Pt's family, at baseline, Pt. is 
functional at home and can perform all ADLs independently, and 
that her speech is more fluent at baseline.  One morning during 
the hospitalization, she was found down in bathroom on floor 
with head against wall in corner of bathroom.  There was no 
evidence of traumatic injury, and extremities had full ROM. Pt. 
reported no pain, and there was no focal neurologic deficit.  A 
head CT and hip XR were both unremarkable.  By the time of 
discharge, the Pt. was alert and oriented and her speech was 
normal.
.
The Pt. was evaluated by geriatrics team, who recommended 
treatment with olanzepine, which we initiated.  The Pt. appeared 
to tolerate this well.  At the time of discharge, the Pt's 
mental status was significantly improved.
.
The Pt. was seen and evaluated by physical therapy and social 
work during this admission.  The Pt. was discharged to 
rehabilitation with plan to return to home after recuperation 
and when able to safely perform ADLs.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     ARTERIAL DOPPLER, LOWER EXTREMITY
     
     REASON:  Diminished pulses and leg pain.
     
     FINDINGS:  Doppler evaluation was performed of both lower extremity arterial
     systems at rest.  On the right, Doppler tracings are monophasic at the femoral
     level with  dampened amplitude.  There are no dopplerable pulses below.  There
     is no ankle-brachial index.  Pulse volume recordings shows significant
     artifact.  So very difficult to interpret better.  Essentially flat line at
     the metatarsals.
     
     On the left, Doppler tracings are monophasic at all levels from the femoral to
     the dorsalis pedis artery.  Ankle brachial index is 0.49.  Pulse volume
     recordings are also almost flat line at the metatarsals.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Significant aortobiiliac or proximal femoral artery occlusive
     disease.  In addition, there is some multisegmental disease with severe flow
     deficit to both forefeet.

     PROCEDURE:  Diagnostic abdominal aortogram with right lower extremity runoff
     via a left retrograde common femoral approach.

     INDICATION:  80-year-old female with acute on chronic right lower extremity
     pain with history of peripheral vascular disease.  
     
     PROCEDURE:  With the patient supine upon the Interventional Radiology Suite
     after adequate induction of intravenous conscious sedation the patient's
     groins were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Through a
     retrograde left common femoral approach access was gained with a single
     puncture technique, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] wire was advanced into the common iliac artery
     and a 4 French sheath was placed over a wire.  Because of disease in the left
     common iliac artery we switched to an angle glide catheter 035 inch and this
     was maneuvered through a proximal common iliac stenoses and distal aortic
     disease into the abdominal aorta.  An omniflush catheter was placed over the
     wire into the abdominal aorta at the L1 level and an abdominal aortogram was
     taken.  This revealed a patent but diseased infrarenal aorta with a patent
     bilateral renal arteries, there was also a tight narrowing at the distal
     abdominal aorta just proximal to the aortic bifurcation.  The left common
     iliac artery shows a tight stenotic area with an occluded internal iliac
     artery on the left side.  The right superficial femoral artery is occluded
     with a patent right internal iliac artery which is feeding collaterals that
     reconstitute the right profunda femoral artery.  We then obtained access up
     and over the bifurcation with the omniflush catheter which was left in the
     distal common iliac artery.  From there serial imaging of the right lower
     extremity were obtained revealing a patent profunda femoral artery, and
     occluded superficial femoral with reconstitution of the above the knee
     popliteal artery.  The popliteal was patent and ended up in a patent peroneal
     artery with a diseased posterior tibialis with a single vessel runoff down to
     the foot via the peroneal.  At this point, we concluded the procedure and
     proceeded to do pull back pressure measurements which revealed a 20 point
     gradient across the left common iliac artery lesion.  The sheath was left in
     place for later removal in the holding area.  The patient tolerated the
                                                                 (Over)

     RADIOLOGIC FINDINGS
     
     1. Patent but diseased infrarenal aorta with patent bilateral renal arteries.
     The distal abdominal aorta is heavily diseased with a moderate more than 50%
     stenosis just proximal to the aortic bifurcation.  On the right the right
     external iliac artery is occluded with a patent internal iliac artery.  On the
     left, the left common iliac artery has a high grade stenosis and the internal
     iliac is occluded with a patent external and common femoral.  
     
     2. The right lower extremity runoff revealed a patent profunda femoral artery
     via collaterals.
     
     3. The SFA is completely occluded with reconstitution of the above the knee
     popliteal artery.
     
     4. The popliteal artery is patent and gives out a diseased posterior tibialis
     artery and a patent peroneal artery which supplies the only runoff down to the
     foot.  
     
     Arterial pressure measurements were as followed:
     
     1. Distal aorta 184/57 with a mean of 106 as well as the left proximal common
     iliac artery.  The left external iliac artery was 134/51 with a mean pressure
     of 86. 
     
     The moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of Versed
     and Fentanyl throughout the procedure which lasted a total of 1 hour.  During
     the procedure the patient's hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored
     and there were no complications.

     RADIOLOGIC FINDINGS
     
     1. Patent but diseased infrarenal aorta with patent bilateral renal arteries.
     The distal abdominal aorta is heavily diseased with a moderate more than 50%
     stenosis just proximal to the aortic bifurcation.  On the right the right
     external iliac artery is occluded with a patent internal iliac artery.  On the
     left, the left common iliac artery has a high grade stenosis and the internal
     iliac is occluded with a patent external and common femoral.  
     
     2. The right lower extremity runoff revealed a patent profunda femoral artery
     via collaterals.
     
     3. The SFA is completely occluded with reconstitution of the above the knee
     popliteal artery.
     
     4. The popliteal artery is patent and gives out a diseased posterior tibialis
     artery and a patent peroneal artery which supplies the only runoff down to the
     foot.  
     
     Arterial pressure measurements were as followed:
     
     1. Distal aorta 184/57 with a mean of 106 as well as the left proximal common
     iliac artery.  The left external iliac artery was 134/51 with a mean pressure
     of 86. 
     
     The moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of Versed
     and Fentanyl throughout the procedure which lasted a total of 1 hour.  During
     the procedure the patient's hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored
     and there were no complications.

      80 year old woman with RLE ischemia.                                            
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Evaluate RLE arterial circulation, possible intervention. This is for [**Doctor Last Name 2013**].

     PROCEDURE:  Diagnostic abdominal aortogram with right lower extremity runoff
     via a left retrograde common femoral approach.  
     
     PHYSICIANS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2013**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14141**].
     
     INDICATION:  80-year-old female with acute on chronic right lower extremity
     pain with history of peripheral vascular disease.  
     
     PROCEDURE:  With the patient supine upon the Interventional Radiology Suite
     after adequate induction of intravenous conscious sedation the patient's
     groins were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Through a
     retrograde left common femoral approach access was gained with a single
     puncture technique, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] wire was advanced into the common iliac artery
     and a 4 French sheath was placed over a wire.  Because of disease in the left
     common iliac artery we switched to an angle glide catheter 035 inch and this
     was maneuvered through a proximal common iliac stenoses and distal aortic
     disease into the abdominal aorta.  An omniflush catheter was placed over the
     wire into the abdominal aorta at the L1 level and an abdominal aortogram was
     taken.  This revealed a patent but diseased infrarenal aorta with a patent
     bilateral renal arteries, there was also a tight narrowing at the distal
     abdominal aorta just proximal to the aortic bifurcation.  The left common
     iliac artery shows a tight stenotic area with an occluded internal iliac
     artery on the left side.  The right superficial femoral artery is occluded
     with a patent right internal iliac artery which is feeding collaterals that
     reconstitute the right profunda femoral artery.  We then obtained access up
     and over the bifurcation with the omniflush catheter which was left in the
     distal common iliac artery.  From there serial imaging of the right lower
     extremity were obtained revealing a patent profunda femoral artery, and
     occluded superficial femoral with reconstitution of the above the knee
     popliteal artery.  The popliteal was patent and ended up in a patent peroneal
     artery with a diseased posterior tibialis with a single vessel runoff down to
     the foot via the peroneal.  At this point, we concluded the procedure and
     proceeded to do pull back pressure measurements which revealed a 20 point
