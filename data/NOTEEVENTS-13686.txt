Admission Date:  [**2507-3-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2507-3-29**]

Date of Birth:   [**2423-4-7**]       Sex:  M

Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old
male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial
fibrillation on Coumadin, gastroesophageal reflux disease who
was brought to the Emergency Department by the EMT after he
complained of intermittent chest pain for three days, nausea
and lethargy.  The patient has had some episodes of
constipation as well as dark stools, increasing lower
extremity edema for the past two to three weeks.  He denies
any vomiting, abdominal pain or diarrhea.  The chest pain
resolved after arrival to the Emergency Department.  The EMTs
found him to have a heart rate in the 200s, irregular and he
was given Diltiazem which decreases heart rate to the 70s.
Electrocardiogram was consistent with rapid atrial
fibrillation.  In the Emergency Department, his heart rate
was in the 70s and electrocardiogram showed atrial
fibrillation with inferolateral ST segment depressions.
Hematocrit was noted to be 18.  His baseline is 30.  His
stool was black and guaiac positive.  Systolic blood pressure
was 88 to 100.  Nasogastric lavage was performed and noted to
be negative.  The wife reports multiple urinary tract
infections since [**2506-8-4**] with courses of Augmentin,
Keflex and now ciprofloxacin.  The patient had noted diarrhea
in January and constipation for the last three to four weeks.
He denies any dysuria, shortness of breath, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, headache, fevers, chills or coughs.  He
has noted increasing lower extremity edema and weight gain
since early [**2505-3-4**].  He manages with an increased Lasix
dose.  He also noted an increased blood sugar over the
weekend and his wife gave him glyburide.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory

PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 96.3��, pulse 80, blood pressure
89/39, respiratory rate 23, O2 saturation 97% on 2 liters.
GENERAL:  He is a pale, alert elderly gentleman in no acute
distress.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Head is normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
Conjunctivae is pale.  Mouth and oropharynx are clear without
any erythema or exudate.
NECK:  Supple.  There is no lymphadenopathy.
PULMONARY:  He has deep bibasilar rales, no wheezes.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Irregularly irregular with 2/6 systolic
ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with palpable liver
edge approximately 4 cm below the costophrenic angle.
EXTREMITIES:  3+ edema to the knees.  Feet are warm with no
palpable pulses.
RECTAL:  Per the Emergency Department, is black.  OB is
positive.

LABS:  White cell count 15/6, hematocrit 18.2, platelets 334.
His hematocrit on discharge was 31.7.  PT 21.8, INR 3.3, PTT
36.2, creatinine 1.3, BUN 97.  Troponin on admission was 7.4.

IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with
heart rate in the 70s.  Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with
mild congestive heart failure, linear opacities in the mid
right lung, no change from [**2506-9-3**].

ASSESSMENT:  This is an 83-year-old man who presents with a
history of coronary artery disease, rapid atrial fibrillation
who presents with severe anemia and guaiac positive stool
consistent with a gastrointestinal bleed.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit with a hematocrit of 18 thought
to be secondary to an active gastrointestinal bleed.
Nasogastric lavage was negative in the Emergency Department,
but he was noted to have dark black melanotic guaiac positive
stools.  The gastroenterology team was consulted and they
initially recommended transfusing to keep his hematocrit over
30 with plans for endoscopy when he troponin decreased.  He
was transfused 3 units of packed red blood cells initially
with an adequate increase in his hematocrit.  He underwent an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy on hospital day #3 which showed
gastritis.  Because his hematocrit continued to trend
downward, the patient underwent a colonoscopy to rule out a
lower gastrointestinal bleed.  Colonoscopy showed a few
diverticula as well as a single 13 mm nonbleeding polyp of
benign appearance which was removed for biopsy.  He was also
noted to have some diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon.  His
hematocrit has been subsequently stable with no evidence of
active gastrointestinal bleeding.

2.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was admitted with a hematocrit
of 18 thought to be secondary to a gastrointestinal bleed in
the setting of a supratherapeutic INR.  He was given a dose
of vitamin K subcutaneously to reverse his INR and his
Coumadin withheld throughout his hospitalization.  He was
transfused periodically to keep his hematocrit above 30 given
his history of coronary artery disease.  His hematocrit was
stable upon discharge and his Coumadin was restarted upon
discharge.

3.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  He was found to be in atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response that slowed with
Diltiazem.  Troponins were elevated with flat CKs.  This was
felt to be secondary to demand ischemia in a setting of an
acute blood loss.  His troponin was trending downward and
given a history of coronary artery disease, a Persantine
thallium was performed for further risk stratification.  The
study showed global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of
39% and a severe fixed defect in the distal anterior apical
myocardial wall.  He was also started on Lasix and aldactone
as he was felt to be in congestive heart failure.

4.  RENAL:  His increased creatinine on admission was felt to
be secondary to intervascular depletion given his blood loss
and his creatinine decreased with blood transfusions and
intravenous fluids.

5.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had a history of
recurrent urinary tract infection.  A routine urinalysis was
sent and noted to be negative.  The patient was afebrile and
his white cell count was stable throughout his
hospitalization.

DISPOSITION:  The patient has been severely deconditioned
over the past few months given his multiple hospitalizations
and his comorbidities.  He was screened by the physical
therapy team who recommended a short term stay in
rehabilitation prior to being discharged to home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Digoxin 0.125 mg po q day
2.  Lipitor 20 mg po q day
3.  Protonix 40 mg po q day
4.  Iron sulfate 325 mg po q day

                                     FINAL REPORT
     SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB:
     Persantine was infused intravenously for approximately 4 minutes at a  dose of 
     approximately 0.142 mg/kg/min.  The patient experienced no symptoms.  The ST
     segments were uninterpretable for ischemia due to Digoxin therapy. 
      
     HISTORY:  Eighty-three year old male with past h/o coronary artery disease, s/p
     left anterior descending stent, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure
     and diabetes, and anemia.  Elevated troponin, flat CKs thought to be  related to
     demand ischemia.  Please assess for areas of perfusion and wall motion
     abnormalities.
      
     INTERPRETATION:  One to three minutes after the cessation of infusion, 
     MIBI was administered IV.
      
     Image Protocol: Gated SPECT.
      
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium.
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.
      
     The stress and resting perfusion images demonstrate a severe, fixed perfusion
     defect involving the distal anterior wall and extending to involve the apex.
      
     Ejection fraction calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after
     Persantine administration shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of
     approximately 39%.  The wall motion demonstrates global hypokinesia of the
     visualized walls.
      
     IMPRESSION:  1) There is a severe, fixed defect involving the distal anterior
     and apical myocardial walls.  2) Left ventricular ejection fraction is reduced
     at 39%.  3) There is global hypokinesia. /nkg

     TECHNIQUE:  Multiple contiguous slices were obtained through the pelvis before
     and after administration of contrast through the drain.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The drain is in the right lower
     quadrant and there is no evidence of collection around it.  A Foley catheter
     is seen in the bladder.  There is no evidence of a collection in the pelvis.
     After administration of contrast through the drain the contrast seems to go
     into the subcutaneous tissues without going into a clear collection area.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Right lower quadrant drain without evidence of collection in this
     quadrant.  The sinogram does not show communication to the colon.

     INDICATION: Abdominal pain with a draining abscess.
     
     CT ABDOMEN, PELVIS:
     
     TECHNIQUE: CT images were acquired from the lung bases through the pubic
     symphysis using 150 cc of IV Optiray contrast.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There are small bilateral pleural effusions,
     right greater than the left.  There are pleural calcifications, possibly
     related to prior asbestos exposure.  There are extensive arterial vascular
     calcifications. The spleen is enlarged, measuring 17 cm.  The liver, pancreas,
     adrenal glands, stomach, and visualized portions of the large and small bowel
     are unremarkable.  There is a subcentimeter low attenuation lesion within the
     mid left kidney, probably representing a simple cyst.  The right kidney is
     normal. The patient is status post cholecystectomy.  There is no free air
     within the abdomen.  There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric
     lymphadenopathy.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a 5.6 x 2.8 cm fluid and air collection
     within the right pelvis at the level of the right acetabulum.  A Foley
     catheter is present within the bladder. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.
     The visualized portions of large and small bowel are unremarkable.  The
     appendix is not clearly visualized.
     
     BONE WINDOWS: There are multilevel degenerative changes to the spine.

     The kidneys demonstrate normal cortical medullary thickness, no hydronephrosis
     or nephrolithiasis.  Slight increase in echo texture, consistent with
     medical/renal disease, non-specific.
     
     In the area of the previously documented 2 cm fluid collection within the
     pelvis,currently there is only a small focus of fluid left 1/2 cm in diameter.
     Thus, neither drainable nor amenable to aspiration.

     Patient has intra-abdominal abscess, recently drained. Now with chest pain,
     shortness of breath. Evaluate possible pulmonary complications.
     
     FINDINGS: A single AP semi-upright chest image is provided. Comparison study
     dated [**2507-7-21**]. A pacemaker powerpack overlies the right upper thorax and a
     single electrode is noted with its tip well positioned at the apex of the
     right ventricle. The heart again shows marked left ventricular enlargement.
     There is evidence of some upper zone redistribution and bibasilar illdefined
     loss of translucency, consistent with mild left heart failure. There is also
     again evidence of left lower lobe collapse and consolidation behind the heart.
     No definite effusion is identified on the right side but the left costophrenic
     angle is not demonstrated. Small effusions cannot be excluded.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) Satisfactory placement of single electrode pacemaker. 2) LV
     enlargement and probable slight left heart failure.
