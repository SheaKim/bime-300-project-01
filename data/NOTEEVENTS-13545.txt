     Comparison is made to the prior study from [**3153-11-24**].
     
     SEMI-UPRIGHT AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter
     is present with the tip in the main pulmonary artery.  A chest tube and
     mediastinal drain are present.  Sternal wires are present.  There is no
     pneumothorax.  There is increased cardiomegaly, along with increased lung
     opacity indicating worsening congestive heart failure.  There is a
     retrocardiac opacity which likely represents atelectasis.  The osseous
     structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  No pneumothorax.
     2)  Moderate congestive heart failure, increased since the prior study.
