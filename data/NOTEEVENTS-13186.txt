     86-year-old female with change in mental status.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2911-5-10**].
     
     AP PORTABLE CHEST:  The heart size is within normal limits.  Again
     demonstrated is the tortuous aorta with calcifications of the arch.  The
     mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There is apparent blunting of
     the left costophrenic sulcus which may be due to patient positioning or
     possibly represent a small left pleural effusion.  The right lung is grossly
     clear.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified.  Pulmonary
     vasculature is unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No pneumonia identified.  Possible small left pleural effusion.
     If pneumonia remains a clinical concern, full PA and lateral radiographs are
     suggested when the patient may tolerate this.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 87 y/o female with PMH sig for Parkisons Disease, 
Dementia, h/o Recurrent UTIs, with recent [**Hospital1 19**] admission 
[**2911-6-27**]->[**2911-7-1**] for hypotension and UTI. During this admission, 
she was admitted for lethargy and found to have a systolic BP in 
the upper 50s. Her hypotension resolved by the time she was 
admitted to the medical team, and the thought was that it may 
have been d/t medicince effect from changes in her 
antihypertensive. Her EKG was without evidence of acute ischemia 
and she ruled out for a myocardial infarction. Her lisinopril, 
atenolol and norvasc were decreased and she remained 
normotensive on this admission. In addition, she was found on 
urine culture to have a Urinary tract infection with E. coli. 
She was treated with levofloxacin, to complete a 7 day course.  
.  
She now presents from NH with hypotension, increasing lethargy, 
diarrhea and fever. ROS and HPI are extremely limited as patient 
is not able to relate history. Initial VS in the ED: 100R, 74, 
61/30 24 95% RA. Initial Lactate was 3.4 which decreased to 2.5 
after IVF fluids. Labs revealing for new leucocytosis (WBC of 
19.9 from 6.2 on discharge) along with new ARF (1.2-->2.8)  
.  
In the ED, the pt was given CTX (which the E coli is susecptible 
to) along with Flagyl. She received aggresse IVF resuscitation 
with increased in her BP to 110s systolic.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) SEPSIS:
Pt was initially treated on floor for UTI but then transferred 
to the ICU for septic shock with hypotension, decreased urine 
output.  Pt was put on broad spectrum antibiotics to cover UTI 
as well as C diff.  She was on ceftriaxone for E/ coli UTI as 
well as IV vanco.
Her hypotension resolved.  She remained AF and WBC normalized.  
Her repeat urine cultures were negative and she completed 10d 
course of ceftriaxone for the UTI.  
.  
2) C DIFF:
Pt had positive C diff toxin early in the admission and was 
started on flagyl and PO vanco.  However, treatment of her Cdiff 
was prolonger by intervening antibiotics for other infections.  
At discharge she requires about 8 more days of vanco and flaygl.
.
3) GI BLEED:
Pt also developed a lower GI bleed while in the ICU. Her hct 
remained stable but she had BRBPR.  A colonoscopy showed C diff 
colitis and ischemic colitis resulting in friable mucosa.  As 
her sepsis resolved and c diff was treated, she had no further 
lower GI bleed.
.
4) ANEMIA:
Initially, her HCt was around 30 and stable.  By discharge, it 
ranged from 23 to 25 but was stable.  Iron studies show anemia 
of chronic disease.  There is no active bleeding.
.
5) PNEUMONIA:  After leaving the ICU, pt developed an elevated 
WBC.  CXR showed possible pneumonia so she was treated with 
ceftriaxone and vanco initially and then switched to cipro.  Her 
WBC normalized and resp secretions decreased.  
.
6) PICC site infection:  She developed exudate at site of PICC.  
Culture showed pseudomonas.  Treated with cipro.  PICC changed 
to new site.
.   
7) cardiac arrhythmia: 
EKG [**7-17**] appeared to be possible a-fib c RVR (105) and compared 
to prior EKG done on admission which was read by a cardiologist 
(sinus rhythm c freq. atrial ectopy), does appear to be more 
irregularly irregular. Pt without symptoms during this episode. 
Subsequently in NSR c frequent PACs. Thus do not believe a-fib 
an element to pt's hypotension. If pt does go into a-fib, would 
not be a good candidate for anticoagulation given current 
bleeding from below and fall risk.  
.  
8) HTN: Holding home antihypertensives (amlodipine 2.5 mg, 
lisinopril 2.5 mg, atenolol 12.5 mg BID) given overall 
malnutrition, initial hypotension.  Can be restarted as outpt 
once BP in stable range.  
.  
9) Dementia/Parkinsons:  For much of the hospitalization, 
sinemet was held due to inability to take POs.  This was 
restarted once PEG placed.  
.  
10) MALNUTRUTION:  Pt suffered from severe malnutrition, likely 
long standing and exacerbated by acute illness.  Albumin<2.0.  
She was likely not getting sufficient nutrition PO.  She is also 
high aspiration risk and should not take any POs.  PEG placed 
and started on TFs.
.
11) ANASARCA:  DEveloped while in septic shock but persisted due 
to hypoalbunemia.  Did not attempt diuresis given low albumin.  
Once nutritional status improved, expect some degree of 
autodiuresis which can be assisted with diuretics if needed.  
.  
12) CODE STATUS:  Initially full code, after family meeting week 
before discharge, made DNR/DNI

     HISTORY:  87-year-old female with acute renal failure.
     
     COMPARISON:  No prior study available for comparison.
     
     RENAL ULTRASOUND:
     
     There are multiple cysts of both kidneys, which makes measurement of overall
     size and cortical thickness unreliable.  A best estimate of the right renal
     size including cysts is 12.8 cm.  The left kidney contains relatively fewer
     cysts, and the best estimated at overall size is 9.2 cm.  Some of the cysts
     have internal echoes, possibly representing hemorrhage.  No definite renal
     stones or hydronephrosis is identified.  The urinary bladder is decompressed
     and contains a Foley catheter.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Multiple bilateral renal cysts with appearance suggestive of
     polycystic kidney disease.  No evidence of hydronephrosis.

     ABDOMEN, Bedside on [**2911-7-11**] at 1:08 p.m.
     
     HISTORY:  C-diff colitis.  Abdominal tenderness.  Possible free air.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Single overhead view of the abdomen shows essentially normal
     intestinal gas pattern and no free intraperitoneal gas.  There is heavy
     atherosclerotic calcification of the aortoiliac system.  Severe degenerative
     change is seen in the mid and lower lumbar spine.

     AP CHEST, 12:57 P.M., [**2911-7-12**].
     
     HISTORY:  Colitis, fever and hypotension.  Rule out free air.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**2911-7-9**].
     
     Small bilateral pleural effusions are new.  Mild atelectasis probably explains
     increasing opacity at both lung bases.  The upper lungs are clear.  Heart size
     top normal.  No pneumothorax.  Right PIC catheter passes as far as the mid
     third of the SVC, but the tip is obscured.
     
     No free subdiaphragmatic gas is  noted.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Left lower quadrant and epigastric pain.  History of Clostridium
     difficile.
     
     COMPARISON:  No radiographs available for comparison.  Report from the renal
     ultrasound dated [**2911-7-6**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained after
     the administration of oral contrast.  IV contrast was not administered
     secondary to lack of IV access.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There are bilateral small pleural
     effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.  There is mild ascites.
     Non-contrast evaluation of the liver otherwise demonstrates no definite focal
     lesions.  The spleen is unremarkable.  There is a likely 1.2 cm splenic artery
     aneurysm.  The adrenal glands are poorly visualized, but likely normal.  The
     left kidney is small with innumerable hyperdense and hypodense lesions.  The
     right kidney has a lobulated contour with innumerable hyperdense and hypodense
     lesions.  There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.  There are extensive
     calcifications of the coronary arteries, aorta, and iliac arteries.
     
     There is probable thickening of the transverse colon extending to the splenic
     flexure and descending colon.  Evaluation of the sigmoid colon is limited due
     to under filling with possible wall thickening.  There are multiple sigmoid
     diverticula.  There is marked wall edema of the rectum with marked surrounding
     inflammatory stranding.  Slight inflammatory stranding is demonstrated
     surrounding the splenic flexure.  There is no definite thickening of the
     ascending colon.  No definite pneumatosis is seen.  Loops of small bowel are
     of normal caliber with no wall thickening.  There are multiple small
     mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes that do not meet CT criteria for
     pathologic enlargement.  There is no intra-abdominal free air.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is air within the bladder,
     presumably secondary to the Foley catheterization.  Marked rectal wall edema
     with surrounding inflammatory change is described above.
     
     Bone windows reveal degenerative changes.  There is a severe compression
     fracture of L2 with a moderate anterior wedge deformity of L1.  There are
     degenerative endplate changes with vacuum disc phenomenon at multiple levels.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Marked wall edema with surrounding inflammatory change of the rectum with
                                                                 (Over)

     TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
     
     INDICATION:  Fever and hypotension, evaluate for pneumonia.
     
     FINDINGS: AP single view has been obtained with patient in semi-upright
     position and is analyzed in direct comparison with a similar preceding study
     of [**2911-7-12**].  No significant interval change can be identified.  The
     accessible mid and apical lung fields do not show new infiltrates and the
     pulmonary vasculature does not show any congestive pattern.  As before, the
     bases are somewhat obscured related to high positioned diaphragms and blunting
     of the lateral pleural sinuses indicating bilateral pleural effusions of
     moderate degree.  Comparison suggests that the right-sided pleural effusion
     has increased slightly but this may also be related to slight changes in
     position.  No new parenchymal infiltrates can be seen.  As before, advanced
     degenerative changes exist in the left shoulder joint.
     
     IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions but no evidence of new parenchymal
     infiltrates or advanced pulmonary congestion.  PICC line unchanged.

     HISTORY:  87-year-old woman with C diff colitis and increased abdominal
     tenderness.
     
     SUPINE ABDOMEN:  There is a normal bowel gas pattern without evidence of
     obstruction.  Retained barium is identified within the colon.  There is no
     evidence of colonic dilatation.  There is some separation of small bowel loops
     in the right lower quadrant which could represent thickening.  No definite
     intraperitoneal free air is identified, however, the upper portions of the
     abdomen are not included on the exam.  Again seen is a collapsed L2 vertebral
     body as well as degenerative changes of other lumbar vertebral levels, the SI
     joints, and hip joints.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of bowel obstruction or megacolon.

     INDICATION:  Assessment of OG tube placement.
     
     Portable AP view of the chest compared to [**7-15**].
     
     The newly taken film is underpenetrated.  The course of NG tube cannot be
     assessed further than hilum of the lungs.  These suggest a new radiograph to
     assess the place of OG tube.  Otherwise, mediastinal and hilar contours are
     normal.  There is stable small bilateral effusion and basilar atelectasis.
     
     IMPRESSION:  OG tube cannot be assessed due to underpenetration and we need
     another study to assess OG tube course.  Otherwise, stable bilateral small
     pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis.

Pt with frequent productive cough but does not swallow and is at severe risk of aspiration due to oral OGT in place. Frequent oral suctioning with yankuer required. Sats are difficult to check due to poor perfusion in fingers and the only place we can get sat is on her forhead and this only works infrequently.

GI: Was getting tube feeds via OGT until she started passing gelatenous bloody stools. Hct checked and was stable at 31.1. GI service saw pt and she may be prepped for colonoscopy tomorrow. I will insert mushroom catheter if she is to get go-lytely prep. Pt was made NPO after NGT lavage was done. IVF NS at 80cc/hr started.

GU: UO is good via foley. Urine in cloudy light yellow.

     History of gastric tube placement.
     
     The distal end of the orogastric tube probably extends below diaphragm but
     cannot be clearly localized on this film, which is suboptimal due to motion
     and underpenetration.  There are bilateral pleural effusions with associated
     atelectases in the lower zones.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Distal end of OG tube not clearly localized on film with marked
     motional blurring and a repeat more penetrated film would be necessary to
     confirm location of tip of OG tube below the diaphragm.

     INDICATION FOR STUDY:  Bilateral pleural effusions.
     
     A single AP view of the chest is obtained on [**2911-7-27**] at 16:00 hours and is
     compared with the prior radiograph of [**2911-7-23**].  Again are seen bilateral large
     pleural effusions which do not appear to have significantly changed in
     appearance since the prior radiograph.  The opacification of the lower thorax
     bilaterally makes it impossible to assess associated atelectasis and/or
     consolidation.  The upper lung zones appear unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Limited evaluation due to large bilateral pleural effusions which do not
     appear to have significantly changed in size since the prior radiograph.

     FINDINGS:  A single supine abdominal portable radiograph of partial abdomen
     was reviewed.  Study is limited secondary to incomplete coverage of the
     abdomen as well as body habitus.  There is a paucity of air-filled bowel
     loops, but no dilated bowel loops are identified.  There is positive air

     the right arm and needs another IV access.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1230**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1243**], the
     attending radiologist who was present and supervising throughout the
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  Since no suitable veins were visible, ultrasound was
     used to identify the left basilic vein that was patent and compressible.  The
     left arm was then prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  After 5 mL
     of 1% lidocaine, the left basilic vein was accessed with a 21-gauge needle
     under ultrasonographic guidance.  A 0.018 guidewire was then advanced into the
     proximal SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was then exchanged for a
     micropuncture sheath.  Based on the markers on the guidewire, it was
     determined that a length of 40 cm would be suitable.  The PICC line was then
     cut to this length and advanced over the wire into the proximal part of the
     SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The peel-away sheath was then removed and
     the line was flushed, heplocked, and Statlocked.  A final fluoroscopic image
     of the thorax demonstrates the tip of the catheter to be located in the
     proximal part of the SVC.  There were no immediate complications.
     
     [**Hospital Unit Name **]: The tip of the catheter was left in the proximal SVC, since no
     progression of the wire was seen( central obstruction?).
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 40 cm long single lumen line placed via
     the left basilic vein with the tip in the proximal SVC. The line is ready for

     INDICATION:  Check PICC line.
     
     AP PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST:  Compared to [**2911-7-28**].  There is a left-sided PICC
     line with its tip likely located within the peripheral subclavian vein.  In
     order to obtain placement in the SVC, it should be advanced at least 12 cm.
     There is no pneumothorax.  There are large bilateral pleural effusions.  The
     cardiac silhouette is largely obscured.  Equivocal consolidation in the right
     upper lobe.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Left PICC tip likely within the left subclavian vein; it should be advanced
     at least 12 cm if placement in the SVC is desired.  Findings discussed with
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 355**].
     2) No significant interval change in large bilateral pleural effusions with
     CHF/volume overload.  Underlying consolidation not excluded.

     INDICATION:  87-year-old woman who is diagnosed with a left lower lobe
     pneumonia at an outside hospital, and clinically was not improving.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2911-8-11**].
     
     SUPINE FRONTAL CHEST:  Patient's position limits evaluation.  The right lung
     appears clear.  A retrocardiac left lower lobe opacity is seen as well as a
     small left-sided pleural effusion.  A tortuous thoracic aorta is
     redemonstrated.  The osseous structures demonstrate diffuse bony
     demineralization.  Degenerative change of the left shoulder is seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac left lower lobe opacity likely representing collapse
     and small left- sided pleural effusion.  A technically better study, ideally
     PA and lateral, is recommended when the patient is able.

     INDICATION FOR EXAM:  This is an 87-year-old woman with poor IV access, needs
     antibiotic therapy.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1230**] and [**Doctor Last Name 1243**], the
     attending radiologist who was present and supervising throughout the
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  Since no superficial veins were visible, ultrasound
     was used to identify the right basilic vein which was patent and compressible.
     The right arm of the patient was then prepped and draped in a standard sterile
     fashion.  After injection of 5 cc of 1% lidocaine, a 21-gauge needle was
     advanced into the right basilic vein under ultrasonographic guidance and hard
     copies of the images were obtained before and after the venipuncture.  A 0.018
     guidewire was then advanced through the needle into the distal part of the SVC
     under fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was then exchanged for a 4.5 French
     micropuncture sheath.  Based on the marker in the guidewire, it was determined
     that a length of 32 cm would be suitable.  The line was then trimmed to this
     length and advanced over the wire into the distal part of the SVC under
     fluoroscopic guidance.  The wire and peel-away sheath were then removed and
     the line was flushed, heplocked and statlocked.  A final fluoroscopic image of
     the chest demonstrates the tip of the catheter to be located in the mid part
     of the SVC.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a PICC line placed via the right basilic
     vein.  Tip in the mid part of the SVC, and the line is ready for use.
