Brief Hospital Course:
1) Tracheobronchomalacia: Repeat bronchoscopy was repeated here 
and confirmed severe tracheobronchomalacia, with 80-90% collapse 
of trachea, right and left mainstem bronchi. It was decided that 
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 8396**] needed a Y stent, but it was decided to wait until 
her COPD was optimized. She was continued on oral prednisone of 
60mg daily. Pt had persistent hypercarbic respiratory failure 
following y-stent placement, required intubation.  After she was 
weaned off ventilator and extubated, she was found to have an 
abg showing 7.07/128/116/39 and was reintubated and ventilated; 
once she had improved, she was re-extubated but again 
ineffectively ventilated and was re-intubated.  Patient was then 
once again weaned, extubated and this time did well.  Pt's 
hypercarbic respiratory failure was believed to be due to a 
combination of severe COPD, tracheobronchomalacia, auto-peeping, 
and anxiety.
After extubation, pt's respiratory status was believed to be at 
baseline, PFTs were done on the day of discharge to determine 
the amount of benefit from the stent placement.  Pt had a small 
amount of hemoptysis following the numerous intubations, however 
this seemed to be improving and was attributed to the trauma 
from the intubations.
.
2) COPD exacerbation: She was continued on oral prednisone 60mg 
QD, accolate (zafirlukast), theophylline and inhalers/nebs 
around the clock (fluticasone/salmeterol, alb nebs, ipratroprium 
nebs). She continued on BiPAP at night. She was also given 
levaquin for possible bronchitis, and also received a course of 
vancomycin after sputum cultures showed MSSA. Theophylline 
levels were checked regularly to insure that they did not become 
toxic while she was taking levaquin.  Pt wil need to weane her 
prednisone, although her goal dose is not clear as she has 
chronically required some steroids.
.
3) IDDM: She was continued on her outpatient insulin regimen 
(NPH + regular QAM and QPM) and was covered with a Humalog 
sliding scale. Despite these measures, her glucose was widely 
variable and difficult to control, partially due to the oral 
prednisone but also due to the fact that the patient would not 
comply with a diabetic diet and ate frequently. Nutrition was 
consulted. 
.
4) Hyperlipidemia/Hypertriglycidemia: She was continued on her 
outpatient dose of pravachol. 
.
5) HTN: She was continued on her outpatient antihypertensive 
regimen of verapamil, and lisinopril. 
. 
6) Oral thrush: She had a history of oral thrush, but on 
admission it seemed to have resolved. She was given nystatin and 
fluconazole while she was on a steroid taper. 
.
7) FEN: She was given a diabetic, low sodium diet, but had poor 
compliance with her diet. Her electrolytes were checked daily 
and repleted as needed. 
.
8) PPX: She was given protonix for GI prophylaxis given her 
chronic steroid usage. For osteoporosis prophylaxis, she was 
given calcium carbonate, vitamin D, and aledronate. For 
constipation prophylaxis, she was given colace, senna, and 
lactulose. For DVT prophylaxis, she was given heparin SQ. 
.
9) Access: She had peripheral IVs.

     CT TRACHEA DATED [**2797-10-10**]
     
     INDICATION:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and dyspnea on exertion.
     
     CT of the central airways was performed according to the CT trachea protocol. 
     Initially, at end inspiration, images were acquired using a standard-dose
     technique without intravenous or oral contrast administration.  Per the CT
     trachea protocol, imaging extended a few centimeters below the carina but did
     not include the entirety of the lung bases.  Subsequently, using a low-dose
     technique, an acquisition was performed over a similar area during dynamic
     expiratory phase of respiration.  Additionally, using cine mode, images were
     acquired from the level of the aortic arch to the carina during a coughing
     sequence.
     
     At end inspiration, the trachea and main stem bronchi are normal in caliber
     and demonstrate no significant wall thickening.  There is evidence of severe
     tracheobronchomalacia, best demonstrated on the coughing sequence images,
     where there is near complete collapse of the trachea, and complete collapse of
     the main stem bronchi and bronchus intermedius during the coughing procedure.
     The tracheomalacia begins at approximately the level of the aortic arch.
     
     Assessment of the imaged portions of the lungs demonstrates severe emphysema
     with centrilobular features.  A noncalcified nodule is observed in the right
     middle lobe just below the minor fissure, best visualized on image 191 of
     series 4, and measuring approximately 5 mm in greatest diameter.  A
     nonspecific area of ground glass opacity is seen in the right upper lobe
     posteriorly adjacent to the major and minor fissures.  Two tiny micronodules
     are seen in the lung apices, and note is also made of small calcified pleural
     plaques bilaterally.
     
     The imaged portions of the soft tissue structures of the thorax reveal no
     significantly enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes.  Within the imaged
     portion of the heart, diffuse coronary artery calcifications are observed.
     
     Skeletal structures reveal degenerative changes within the spine.
     
     MULTIPLANAR AND 3D RECONSTRUCTION IMAGES:  These images confirm the absence of
     tracheal or bronchial stenosis as well as the absence of endoluminal lesions
     within the trachea or main stem bronchi.  They also confirm the presence of
     airway malacia.
     
                                                                 (Over)

Pt 51YO female with significant hx for COPD requiring multiple admissions to [**Hospital3 **]. Last admit [**10-1**] for COPD exacerbation when she underwent bronch reporting tracheomalacia. Pt refered to [**Hospital1 10**] for further eval by IP team for possible intervention. Pt admitted [**10-9**] to [**Hospital Ward Name **] 11 and taken to OR [**10-15**] for placement of Y stent. Post procedure failed extubation with pH 7.09 and PaCo2 >100...reintubated. Pt then hypotensive with drop in UO. Started on neo, given IVF bolus and paralyzed with improvement in oxygenation, BP and urine output. Successfully extubated and transferred to MICU for further monitoring. Started on abx for presumed pna. 

CV: HR 110-120's, ST with no ectopy. ABP via left radial art line 100-130/60-70's. HR 130-140's with increase in SBP 170's with agitation. Pt on verapamil, lisinopril at home. Started on verapamil last evening. Pt able to be calmed with verbal support and reassurance mostly, but has required prn doses of ativan. LSC triple lumen intact with slight oozing of blood noted at insertion site. 

Resp: Pt initially on 3L NC and Face tent. Pt agitated and pulling off face mask with acute drop in sats to 79%. Face tent increased to 70%FiO2 with 3L NC. Pt on 3L O2 at home with use of Bipap at night. Pt placed on Bipap with 4L maintaining sats 94-96%. When pulling at mask and anxious, sats will decrease to 88%. Pt agitated and SOB....ABG 7.44/49/59/34. Given 1mg ativan with good response. BBS clear-coarse and diminished in lower lobes. 

Neuro: Pt alert/oriented x3. Answering questions appropriately, but occasionally making comments such as ""Is there medicine in this"" referring to suction tubing. Very anxious and angry about hospitalization and ""everything I been through"". Gets very worked up and yelling at times. Responds well to verbal support. Pt has baseline anxiety and per patient takes ativan 0.5mg BID at home. 

GI/GU: Abdomen obese, BS present. On clear liquid diet, taking meds and clear well. Pt very concerned about chocking and afraid to have much more than sips of water. Foley cath draining adequate amounts of UO, clear/yellow. Last BM tuesday. Pt started on bowel regimen. 

ID: Pt on levofloxacin and vanco. Afebrile. Pan cx yesterday...sputum cx showing gram + cocci in pairs/clusters, cx still pending. WBC 24.4 from 31.8. 

Endo: Receiving methylprednisolone....BS AC/HS with sliding scale coverage. Should be started on NPH when diet initiated. 

Social: Family to visit last night, husband called this am. Full code.

     HISTORY:  Tracheobronchiomalacia status post stenting.  Preoperative
     evaluation.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2797-10-17**].
     
     PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
     within normal limits.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Mild atelectatic
     changes are noted at the lung bases.  There are no focal consolidations,
     pleural effusions, or pneumothorax noted.  Flattening of the diaphragms and
     increased AP diameter on the lateral view suggest the presence of emphysema.
     The osseous structures are unremarkable.  A stent is faintly visible within
     the trachea and right main stem bronchus.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No evidence for pneumonia or
     congestive heart failure.
                                                                           DFDdp

     The heart size and mediastinal contours are normal limits for technique. 
     There is a new patchy opacity at the right lung base partially obscuring the
     medial aspect of the right hemidiaphragm.  The lungs are otherwise clear, and
     there are no pleural effusions.
     
     IMPRESSION:  New patchy right lower lobe opacity which may relate to patchy
     atelectasis, aspiration, or early pneumonia.  Follow up radiographs may be
     helpful.

     PA and lateral chest.  There is a parenchymal opacity in the right medial
     basal lung which does not obscure the right heart border.  This is poorly
     localized on lateral projection.  Remainder of lungs clear.  Heart normal size
     without vascular congestion and sharp CP angles.  Flattened diaphragms.  The
     right lower lobe process is probably unchanged from bedside exam one day
     previous as well as from exams [**11-11**], and [**2797-8-25**].
     
     IMPRESSION:  Chronic right basal process.  No acute disease. Possible
