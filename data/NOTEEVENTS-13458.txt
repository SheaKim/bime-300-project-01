                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:
     
     67 y/o man who was noted to have the onset of an acute stroke between 4 and
     4:30 P.M.  He was brought to the ER by ambulance and following unenhanced CT
     scan begun on intravenous TPA by the stroke neurology team.  The patient was
     unable to cooperate and for his own safety intubated.  The patient was brought
     for MRI and MRA.  These scans demonstrated a large right middle cerebral
     territory diffusion deficit. There appeared to be little flow in the right
     internal carotid when compared to the left. Stroke Neurology consulted
     Interventional Neuroradiology for possible interventional management of this
     evolving acute stroke .
     
     PROCEDURE:  The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure were
     explained in detail to the patient's wife and a person representing themselves
     as very close to the family over the phone as the family had been unable to
     travel to the hospital. This was done with the aide of the interpreter.  The
     nature of the patient's possible stroke, difficulty in examining the patient,
     and risks of interventional therapy were reviewed in detail. The alternative
     of not approaching via an interventional route were fully discussed in the
     presence of the stroke neuorlogists.  The family, and family friend, clearly
     understood and wished us to proceed giving telephone consent.
     
     The patient was brought to the Interventional Neuroradiology suite urgently
     and placed supine on the table.  Using a micropuncture set a 5 FR arterial
     sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery.  A 5 FR Envoy catheter
     in conjunction with Teriumo glidewire was used to select the combined origin
     of the right and left [**Street Address 8**] map imaging demonstrated a bovine
     origin to the carotid with flow into both the innominate and left carotid
     system.
     
     The catheter was advanced with the aide of the Terumo guide wire into the
     right common carotid artery.  Arteriographic examination was performed. The
     camera was centered over the distal common carotid artery through the
     supraclinoid carotid artery.
     
     There is slow flow into an extremely tortuous cervical carotid artery.  The
     external carotid artery branches fill prior to the internal carotid artery
     branches. There is moderate stenosis in the supraclinoid carotid artery.
     
     The camera is now centered over the head and injection repeated in the right
                                                                 (Over)

     common carotid artery.  This injection demonstrates once again the
     preferential filling of the external carotid to the internal carotid. There is
     abrupt cutoff of the superior division of the right middle cerebral artery.
     There is flow into the right M-1 segment and cutoff of flow as above and to
     the superior division.  In addition, there is failure to fill the right
     anterior cerebral territory although there is cross filling of the left
     anterior cerebral territory.  Thus, angiographically only the inferior
     division of the right middle cerebral artery was effectively filling in the
     entire right circulation.
     
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10**] of Stroke Neurology were on hand for discussion of
     continuing management and were available throughout the procedure.  It was
     felt that given the aggressive nature of this stroke, aggressive management
     with intra arterial TPA was required in order to give the patient the best
     chance for a reasonable recovery.
     
     A Prowler 10 microcatheter in conjuction with an agility 10 wire was advanced
     into the superior division of the right middle cerebral artery.  Extensive
     efforts at mechanical disruption of the clot were performed with both the wire
     and catheter.  The patient then received 5 units of intra arterial TPA
     directly through the microcatheter.  Repeat arteriographic assessment was
     performed after 5 units of intra arterial TPA through the main catheter which
     was still positioned in the common carotid artery on this right side. It
     continued to demonstrate failure of flow into the superior division of the
     MCA.  Again, seen was failure flow into the right sided anterior cerebral
     segment but as before in order to provide the patient with the best possible
     outcome attention was specifically directed to the superior division of this
     right MCA.  Further attempts were made at mechanical disruption of the clot
     with the aide of the microwire and microcatheter.
     
     Hand injected run through the microcatheter demonstrated the distal extent of
     the clot and the microcatheter was successfully able to pass through.
     Injection at these points in the superior division of the right middle
     cerebral artery demonstrated little antegrade flow presumably based on the
     occlusion proximally.
     
     The Envoy catheter was advanced into the right internal carotid artery.  An
     additional 3 units of intra arterial TPA were administered for a total of 8
     units of intra arterial TPA and the catheter was manipulated with the aide of
     the microwire for further mechanical disruption. The microcatheter pulled back
     and additional 3 units of TPA were administered for a total of 11 units of TPA
     directly into the clot.
     
     Arteriographic assessment was performed centered over the head in AP and
     lateral projections through the main catheter which was in the right internal
     carotid artery . This right internal carotid artery injection continued to
                                                                 (Over)

     demonstrate findings described earlier including dense clot in the superior
     division of the right middle cerebral artery.
     
     The discussion continued to ensue with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9**] and it was decided to give
     a total of 4 additional units of TPA which was done at the proximal clot for
     a total of 15U intraarterial TPA.
     
     Final arterial assessment was performed through the main catheter in the right
     internal carotid artery and continued to demonstrate the findings as described
     earlier with cutoff of the superior division of the MCA and failure to fill
     the right ACA.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well and transferred to the Neurointensive
     Care Unit under the care of the stroke Neurology service. The family was
     informed again with the aide of the interpreter at the completion of the
     procedure.  The sheath remains in place and was sutured in position.  The
     patient tolerated the procedure well and without complication.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Slow flow in right internal carotid artery with extensive
     evidence of cerebral vascular insult including cutoff to the superior division
     of the right middle cerebral artery and no flow into the A-2 segments on the
     right side.  Aggressive treatment with intra arterial TPA was attempted as
     described above.

     HISTORY:
     
     67 y/o man who was noted to have the onset of an acute stroke between 4 and
     4:30 P.M.  He was brought to the ER by ambulance and following unenhanced CT
     scan begun on intravenous TPA by the stroke neurology team.  The patient was
     unable to cooperate and for his own safety intubated.  The patient was brought
     for MRI and MRA.  These scans demonstrated a large right middle cerebral
     territory diffusion deficit. There appeared to be little flow in the right
     internal carotid when compared to the left. Stroke Neurology consulted
     Interventional Neuroradiology for possible interventional management of this
     evolving acute stroke .
     
     PROCEDURE:  The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure were
     explained in detail to the patient's wife and a person representing themselves
     as very close to the family over the phone as the family had been unable to
     travel to the hospital. This was done with the aide of the interpreter.  The
     nature of the patient's possible stroke, difficulty in examining the patient,
     and risks of interventional therapy were reviewed in detail. The alternative
     of not approaching via an interventional route were fully discussed in the
     presence of the stroke neuorlogists.  The family, and family friend, clearly
     understood and wished us to proceed giving telephone consent.
     
     The patient was brought to the Interventional Neuroradiology suite urgently
     and placed supine on the table.  Using a micropuncture set a 5 FR arterial
     sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery.  A 5 FR Envoy catheter
     in conjunction with Teriumo glidewire was used to select the combined origin
     of the right and left [**Street Address 8**] map imaging demonstrated a bovine
     origin to the carotid with flow into both the innominate and left carotid
     system.
     
     The catheter was advanced with the aide of the Terumo guide wire into the
     right common carotid artery.  Arteriographic examination was performed. The
     camera was centered over the distal common carotid artery through the
     supraclinoid carotid artery.
     
     There is slow flow into an extremely tortuous cervical carotid artery.  The
     external carotid artery branches fill prior to the internal carotid artery
     branches. There is moderate stenosis in the supraclinoid carotid artery.
     
     The camera is now centered over the head and injection repeated in the right
                                                                 (Over)

     common carotid artery.  This injection demonstrates once again the
     preferential filling of the external carotid to the internal carotid. There is
     abrupt cutoff of the superior division of the right middle cerebral artery.
     There is flow into the right M-1 segment and cutoff of flow as above and to
     the superior division.  In addition, there is failure to fill the right
     anterior cerebral territory although there is cross filling of the left
     anterior cerebral territory.  Thus, angiographically only the inferior
     division of the right middle cerebral artery was effectively filling in the
     entire right circulation.
     
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10**] of Stroke Neurology were on hand for discussion of
     continuing management and were available throughout the procedure.  It was
     felt that given the aggressive nature of this stroke, aggressive management
     with intra arterial TPA was required in order to give the patient the best
     chance for a reasonable recovery.
     
     A Prowler 10 microcatheter in conjuction with an agility 10 wire was advanced
     into the superior division of the right middle cerebral artery.  Extensive
     efforts at mechanical disruption of the clot were performed with both the wire
     and catheter.  The patient then received 5 units of intra arterial TPA
     directly through the microcatheter.  Repeat arteriographic assessment was
     performed after 5 units of intra arterial TPA through the main catheter which
     was still positioned in the common carotid artery on this right side. It
     continued to demonstrate failure of flow into the superior division of the
     MCA.  Again, seen was failure flow into the right sided anterior cerebral
     segment but as before in order to provide the patient with the best possible
     outcome attention was specifically directed to the superior division of this
     right MCA.  Further attempts were made at mechanical disruption of the clot
     with the aide of the microwire and microcatheter.

     common carotid artery.  This injection demonstrates once again the
     preferential filling of the external carotid to the internal carotid. There is
     abrupt cutoff of the superior division of the right middle cerebral artery.
     There is flow into the right M-1 segment and cutoff of flow as above and to
     the superior division.  In addition, there is failure to fill the right
     anterior cerebral territory although there is cross filling of the left
     anterior cerebral territory.  Thus, angiographically only the inferior
     division of the right middle cerebral artery was effectively filling in the
     entire right circulation.
     
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10**] of Stroke Neurology were on hand for discussion of
     continuing management and were available throughout the procedure.  It was
     felt that given the aggressive nature of this stroke, aggressive management
     with intra arterial TPA was required in order to give the patient the best
     chance for a reasonable recovery.
     
     A Prowler 10 microcatheter in conjuction with an agility 10 wire was advanced
     into the superior division of the right middle cerebral artery.  Extensive
     efforts at mechanical disruption of the clot were performed with both the wire
     and catheter.  The patient then received 5 units of intra arterial TPA
     directly through the microcatheter.  Repeat arteriographic assessment was
     performed after 5 units of intra arterial TPA through the main catheter which
     was still positioned in the common carotid artery on this right side. It
     continued to demonstrate failure of flow into the superior division of the
     MCA.  Again, seen was failure flow into the right sided anterior cerebral
     segment but as before in order to provide the patient with the best possible
     outcome attention was specifically directed to the superior division of this
     right MCA.  Further attempts were made at mechanical disruption of the clot
     with the aide of the microwire and microcatheter.
     
     Hand injected run through the microcatheter demonstrated the distal extent of
     the clot and the microcatheter was successfully able to pass through.
     Injection at these points in the superior division of the right middle
     cerebral artery demonstrated little antegrade flow presumably based on the
     occlusion proximally.
     
     The Envoy catheter was advanced into the right internal carotid artery.  An
     additional 3 units of intra arterial TPA were administered for a total of 8
     units of intra arterial TPA and the catheter was manipulated with the aide of
     the microwire for further mechanical disruption. The microcatheter pulled back
     and additional 3 units of TPA were administered for a total of 11 units of TPA
     directly into the clot.
     
     Arteriographic assessment was performed centered over the head in AP and
     lateral projections through the main catheter which was in the right internal
     carotid artery . This right internal carotid artery injection continued to

     HISTORY:
     
     67 y/o man who was noted to have the onset of an acute stroke between 4 and
     4:30 P.M.  He was brought to the ER by ambulance and following unenhanced CT
     scan begun on intravenous TPA by the stroke neurology team.  The patient was
     unable to cooperate and for his own safety intubated.  The patient was brought
     for MRI and MRA.  These scans demonstrated a large right middle cerebral
     territory diffusion deficit. There appeared to be little flow in the right
     internal carotid when compared to the left. Stroke Neurology consulted
     Interventional Neuroradiology for possible interventional management of this
     evolving acute stroke .
     
     PROCEDURE:  The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure were
     explained in detail to the patient's wife and a person representing themselves
     as very close to the family over the phone as the family had been unable to
     travel to the hospital. This was done with the aide of the interpreter.  The
     nature of the patient's possible stroke, difficulty in examining the patient,
     and risks of interventional therapy were reviewed in detail. The alternative
     of not approaching via an interventional route were fully discussed in the
     presence of the stroke neuorlogists.  The family, and family friend, clearly
     understood and wished us to proceed giving telephone consent.
     
     The patient was brought to the Interventional Neuroradiology suite urgently
     and placed supine on the table.  Using a micropuncture set a 5 FR arterial
     sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery.  A 5 FR Envoy catheter
     in conjunction with Teriumo glidewire was used to select the combined origin
     of the right and left [**Street Address 8**] map imaging demonstrated a bovine
     origin to the carotid with flow into both the innominate and left carotid
     system.
     
     The catheter was advanced with the aide of the Terumo guide wire into the
     right common carotid artery.  Arteriographic examination was performed. The
     camera was centered over the distal common carotid artery through the
     supraclinoid carotid artery.
     
     There is slow flow into an extremely tortuous cervical carotid artery.  The
     external carotid artery branches fill prior to the internal carotid artery
     branches. There is moderate stenosis in the supraclinoid carotid artery.
     
     The camera is now centered over the head and injection repeated in the right

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Present symptoms suggest an acute right hemisphere stroke.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2W brain imaging was obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a large area of restricted diffusion within the right
     frontal, insular, temporal and parietal lobes, consistent with an acute area
     of right middle cerebral artery territorial ischemia of the brain.  There is
     negligible corresponding elevation of T2 signal, supporting the acuity of this
     pathologic process.  There are a few punctate foci of high T2 signal within
     both cerebral hemispheres, likely representing chronic microvascular
     infarctions.  There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline
     structures.  No overt areas of extracranial pathology are noted, other than
     fluid within the [**Last Name (un) 2**]- and oropharynx.  Findings likely are secondary to
     intubation.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Acute right middle cerebral artery territory infarct.
     
     MR [**Name13 (STitle) 3**] OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) 4**] AND ITS TRIBUTARIES:
     
     TECHNIQUE:  3D TOF imaging with multiplanar reconstructions.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is limited visualization of the Circle of [**Location (un) **] tributaries,
     probably reflecting reduced stroke volume.  However, there does appear to be
     considerable asymmetry of flow within the ICAs, with reduced flow seen in the
     visualized right ICA.  Additionally, there is virtually no flow within the
     right middle cerebral artery, certainly consistent with the large infarct seen
     on the conventional MR images.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Reduced flow in the right internal carotid artery.  This could
     reflect the reduced distal middle cerebral atery perfusion, as well as a more
     proximally situated stenosis.  Follow-up MR angiography of the neck arterial
     vasculature will help to resolve the issue of more proximally situated
     stenosis.
