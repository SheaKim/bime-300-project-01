CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and cough.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 57 year old
female with past medical history of polychondritis, initially
diagnosed in [**2738-12-21**], when the patient presented
bilateral ear inflammation.  Since the diagnosis, the patient
has been on Prednisone as well as trials of Methotrexate and
Cytoxan which she did not tolerate due to increased pulmonary
symptoms.  Because of cough and shortness of breath, the
patient was seen by a pulmonologist in [**2740-11-21**], who
performed bronchoscopy which revealed dynamic airway
collapse.  The issue of tracheal bronchial stenting was
raised but BIPAP, CPAP ventilation was initiated at that
time.  The patient was seen by rheumatology clinic here at
[**Hospital1 10**] in [**2740-12-21**], and
again in the beginning of January at which time her
Prednisone was decreased to 30 mg from 40 mg once daily.
There was a discussion of CellCept, however, that was not
initiated.

The patient was admitted to [**Hospital 83**] Hospital in [**2741-1-21**], with respiratory decompensation treated with increased
steroids, BIPAP and nebulizers.  She was readmitted on
[**2741-3-14**], with increased shortness of breath at rest,
subacute in nature and progressive.  She denied any chest
pain, syncope, diaphoresis, fever, chills or sputum
production.  She reports not being able to cough up the
sputum.

At the outside hospital, Solu-Medrol, Levofloxacin, Lovenox,
Pepcid, nebulizer treatment and BIPAP were started and the
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 391**].  In addition, the patient was noted to be in rapid
atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response rate of 150s
which was responsive to Diltiazem.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Polychondritis diagnosed in 12/99, with bilateral ear
inflammation, low [**Doctor First Name 99**] and C-negative.  Recently treated with
Prednisone and Methotrexate.  Methotrexate discontinued due
to cough.
2.  History of breast cancer, status post left mastectomy
thirty years ago.
3.  History of thyroid nodule.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin, Sulfa, Hydrochlorothiazide, Benadryl.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Albuterol nebulizer q4hours.
2.  BIPAP.
3.  Diltiazem 15 mg q1hour.
4.  Solu-Medrol 60 mg once daily.
5.  Levofloxacin 500 mg once daily.
6.  Levoxyl 120 mcg once daily.
7.  Robinul 1 mg twice a day.
8.  Lovenox 70 mg subcutaneous once daily.
9.  Digoxin 0.25 mg alternating with 0.125 mg once daily.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient smoked thirty pack years, quit
about six months ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, pulse 88, blood pressure
127/66, respiratory rate 24, oxygen saturation 92 to 94% on
CPAP mask set at 10/5.  Generally, the patient appeared
bloated with moon facies using accessory muscles of
respiration.  Skin was pink with dry mucous membranes.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat examination - Extraocular
movements are intact.  Neck was obese, no obvious jugular
venous distention or lymphadenopathy was noted.  The heart
had distant sounds, regular rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no
obvious murmurs.  The lungs had inspiratory wheezes
bilaterally.  The lungs were without dullness or egophony.
The abdomen was obese, mildly distended with decreased bowel
sounds, nontender.  Extremities showed slight edema, no
cyanosis or clubbing.

LABORATORY DATA:  From outside hospital on [**2741-3-17**], white
blood cells 13.8, hematocrit 38.0, platelet count 311,000.
Chem7 showed sodium 145, potassium 4.5, chloride 102,
bicarbonate 30, blood urea nitrogen 25, creatinine 0.6,
glucose 205. Digoxin level 1.1.

Chest x-ray from outside hospital by report showed left
basilar atelectasis, no congestive heart failure or
infiltrate.  CT of the neck performed in [**2741-1-21**], showed
diffuse tracheal bronchial wall thickening with associated
air soft luminal narrowing with tracheal narrowing most
severe just above the level of the aortic arch and main stem
bronchi, right upper lobe bronchus and bronchus intermedius.
There were also nonspecific patchy ground glass opacities
within the upper lobes.

Electrocardiogram from the outside hospital showed sinus
tachycardia at 100 beats per minute, normal axis and normal
intervals, left atrial abnormality, right atrial abnormality.
No T wave changes or pathological Q waves.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, the patient is a 57 year old
female with relapsing polychondritis, breast cancer, status
post mastectomy, presenting with two months worsening
shortness of breath due to tracheal chondromalacia and
dynamic airway collapse.

During this hospitalization, the patient's issues included:
1.  Respiratory failure - Initially the patient was on BIPAP,
however, in the setting of desaturation to the mid 80s, the
decision was made to intubate.  Following intubation, the
patient underwent bronchoscopy which revealed diffuse airway
collapse especially at the trachea and the main stem bronchi.

The patient's respiratory failure could also have a component
of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease given her thirty
pack year smoking history and a bicarbonate on admission of
35.

For a possibility of infection contributing to the patient's
pulmonary problem, the patient was continued on Levofloxacin
and Flagyl was added.  She was continued on her steroids as
well as Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.

The patient underwent second bronchoscopy on [**2741-3-19**], with
bilateral main stem and tracheal stent placements.  Over the
next few days, her sedation was decreased and trials of
extubation were initiated.  Her sputum culture grew gram
positive cocci for which she was started on Vancomycin in
addition to Levofloxacin and Flagyl.

In light of persistent airway collapse distant to the stents,
at extensive family discussions, the patient's code status
was changed to ""Do Not Resuscitate"".  As sedation was weaned
down, the patient expressed wish to be extubated.  The
patient wished not to be reintubated in case she would not be
able to support herself.  The patient was extubated on
[**2741-3-24**].  She was not able to support her ventilation or
oxygenation and was pronounced dead at 7:16 p.m. on [**2741-3-24**].
The family declined autopsy.

CAUSE OF DEATH:  Respiratory failure due to dynamic airway
collapse from advanced polychondritis leading to
tracheomalacia.

2.  Infectious disease - The patient did spike fevers for
which antibiotics were initiated.  Besides gram positive
cocci in the sputum, all her cultures were negative.

3.  Rheumatoid  disease - Polychondritis - The patient was
continued on steroids with attempts to wean them.
Rheumatology consultation was also following the patient.

4.  Cardiovascular - During this hospitalization, the patient
had runs of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response rate for which she was continued on Diltiazem and
Digoxin.

5.  Endocrine - For her increased blood sugar on steroids,
the patient was maintained on NPH and regular sliding scale
insulin.  For her hypothyroidism, she was continued on
Levoxyl.

6.  Access - On [**2741-3-21**], right IJ was placed without
complications.  In addition, for monitoring of blood pressure
and respiratory status, left radial arterial line was placed.

7.  Prophylaxis - During hospitalization, the patient was
continued on Protonix and subcutaneous Heparin for
prophylaxis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Hypoxic and hypocarbic respiratory failure.
2.  Polychondritis.
3.  Tracheomalacia and dynamic airway collapse, status post
airway stenting.
4.  Breast cancer.
5.  History of thyroid nodule.
6.  Atrial fibrillation.

MICU Nursing Admission Note:
57y.o. female transferred here from [**Hospital **] Hospital for insertion of tracheal stent. Pt has blocked trachea from chronic illness called polychondritis which has caused the cartilage in her trachea to be destroyed and allowed the cartilage to collapse in her trachea and main stem bronchus. The procedure is planned to be done tomorrow.

PMH: COPD, polychondritis, s/p mastectomy 20yrs ago on the left, s/p thyroidectomy, stopped smoking a few months ago.

Allergies: PCN, Sulfa

Pt has had increasing periods of SOB and increasing DOE for past year. Has been helped symptomatically by the use of home by-pap as well as in-pt by-pap. 

Brief ROS: 

Neuro: Arrived very dyspneic, off her [**Hospital1 **] since arriving in the EW via ambulance. Alert and oriented times three. She had been given ativan prior to transfer for anxiety. Much calmer on the [**Hospital1 66**] machine once settled in bed. Visiting with daughter. Team talking to her about the plan which will probably include foley insertion, intubation, line insertion including a-line and central line.

Cardiac: Pt arrived on diltiazem drip due to pt developing RAF this AM into the 150-160's. BP was also elevated with the RAF into the 170's but upon arrival here is down to 130. She is now on dilt at 15mg/hr and her HR is in the 80's NSR.

Resp: On [**Hospital1 **] with O2 sat 93%. Lungs are coarse with some expiratory wheezes noted. RR in the 20's on the [**Hospital1 66**]. Will possibly be intubated this evening. A CT needs to be reviewed which was done previously.

GI: Will be NPO for now until plan is arranged.

GU: Will need foley insertion if she gets intubated. Pt states she has been using bedpan without difficulty.

IV's: Access is difficult. She came with one peripheral IV which was partially hanging out. IVT has inserted a second line but the team will still be inserting a femoral central line this evening.

ID: Pt is afebrile but will start IV antibiotics this evening for possible bronchitis which may be contributing to her SOB.

Social: Daughter [**Name (NI) **] present and aware of the plan.

MICU Nursing Progress Note 7PM-11PM:
Neuro: Pt required intubation shortly after arrival for hypoxic respiratory failure. During intubation was given 100mg IV propofol, 200mcg IV fentanyl and 2mg IV versed. Post intubation pt has been coughing, resp distressed and required large boluses of propofol and increased drip to 75mcg/kg/min as well as fentanyl drip and boluses. Currently drip is at 100mcg/hr. Continues to [**Doctor Last Name 306**] off the vent with high peak airway pressures if disturbed. Moves all extremities.

Cardiac: Vital signs are stable. Shut off the dilt drip shortly before intubation. It is off at present. BP 99/60 HR 70's no VEA. A-line attempted several times unsuccessfully. Still needs to be done.

Resp: Intubated as a difficult airway using the bronchoscopy scope with minimal sedation. Pt was very uncomfortable during intubation. Pt very bronchospastic, suctioned twice for thick pale yellow secretions. It feels like there is much more secretions but they don't come through the catheter despite lavage and bagging. It only seems to cause increased bronchospasm. Currently on AC 12, 80%, TV 500, with 5cm peep. Breathing over the set rate at times.

GI: NGT inserted. Aspirate is OB+. Pt needs GI prophylaxis ordered.

GU: Foley inserted. Initially drained 450cc's then found to have either leaked or she was incontinent prior to the insertion but her bed was soaked so it was changed. 10cc's water in the balloon. Need to follow for further leakage.

Fluids: Pt started on IVF D51/2NS at 75cc/hr. 

Family: Pt's daughter is aware of the intubation. Will notify her father, pt's husband who is still in [**State 4621**].

IV Access: Triple lumen right groin was inserted without difficulty. Pt's right leg thought to be slightly swollen greater than her left so emergent LENS were done at the bedside which were negative. 

ID: Pt afebrile. Due to her secretions she will be started on Levoquin and flagyl for coverage. Levoquin needs ID approval and still needs to be obtained by the team.

MICU NPN 11AM-11PM:
Neuro: Pt sedated on the propofol and fentanly drips most of the day. A short trial off the meds this AM was done by the team to check to see if she would tolerate PSV failed. Pt has required intermittent propofol and fentanyl boluses as well as increase in the propofol to 80mcg/kg/min as well as increase in the fentanyl drip to 200mcg/hr to prevent her from popping off the vent from high peak pressure alarms. 

Cardiac: Her BP is stable ranging 120-170/50-90. HR stable in the 70's. Her electrolytes were stable with this AM labs. IVF was turned to KVO due to her being in positive fluid balance and this afternoon pt was given 40mg IV lasix from which she has diuresed significantly and is currently 1L negative since MN.

Resp: Pt very difficult to ventillate with increased peak airway pressures and high autopeep. Initially pt had adequate oxygenation but soon after pt returned from OR she dropped her sat to 92 and had PO2 of 56. She is currently on the vent on AC 8, TV 500, FIO2 60% with 5cm peep. ABG's show resp acidosis with hypercapnea with CO2 in the 70's. Rigid bronch and stent insertion was done in the OR without difficulty. Pt still very bronchospastic with very prolonged expiratory phase post procedure. Left lung sounds were almost absent and right had insp/exp wheezes throughout with deminished sounds at the bases. Pt transported down for chest CT angiogram to R/O PE. This showed left upper lobe segmental collapse. Her PIP's continue to be elevated. Recruitment maneuver has helped somewhat and improved her breathsounds on the left a little. I have bagged and suctioned her aggressively also in hopes of re-expanding the lobe. Albuterol and atrovent nebs have been given.

GI: Pt NPO. Abdomen is obese. Bowel sounds are infrequent and faint. I aspirated 175cc's brown OB+ liquid once today. She is on protonix.

GU: Foley draining good amts urine.

Social: Pt's daughter was in to visit and I talked to pt's husband who is in [**State 4621**] via phone.

MICU NPN 11AM-11PM:
Neuro/Social: Pt was weaned off the fentanyl drip late this afternoon in preparation for possible extubation this evening. Decision was made at the family meeting to keep her intubated tonight and comfortable on a propofol drip or may use versed if needed. Plan to d/c sedation in AM and extubate her once she is awake. The family has decided to reintubate her if she fails extubation. They have been at her side all day. Husband and son arrived late today from [**State 4621**]. They want to be here when we plan to wake her up. They seem to calm her down nicely and are not in the way. They want to be here when we plan to wake her and extubate her and will return in the morning at around 8AM unless called earlier. Daughter's cell number is on the front of the blue chart.I restarted pt on propofol at 8:30PM at 20mcg/kg/min. She previously needed high doses for comfort but looks good at this time. I gave her 20mg bolus to begin the drip.
