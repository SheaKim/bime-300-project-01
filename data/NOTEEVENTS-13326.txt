Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2149**] 
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital1 **] for venous graft intervention 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cathetherization-stent placement
 
History of Present Illness:
This 72-year old female with an extensive medical history 
including CABG and valve replacement, PVD, CRI, presents here 
from [**Hospital1 **] with chest pain/management of MI.  
Patient reports being admitted for chf exacerbation in mid-May 
at [**Hospital 2752**] with active diuresis and concern 
for ACS, but because of imparied renal function, plan to medical 
manage and not sent to cath lab. Patient discharged to 
independant living.  
On [**4-23**], patient presented to [**Hospital1 **] with cheif complaints of 
left scapular pain and shortness of breath - diagnosed with 
acute decompensated heart failure, subsequently diuresed, ruled 
in for NQWMI with troponin up to 11.4, ck 290, 12% R/I. [**4-27**] 
cardiac cath showed 3-v native disease (RCA not seen), LIMA to 
LAD-40-50% mid disease, SVG to LV branch of prox CX: 80% 
eccentric proximal stenosis which became worse during cath (? 
catheter trauma), SVG to OM: proximal occlusion, with an 
estimated EF 55-60%. Course complicated by ? of TIA vs. stroke 
last Wed [**4-28**] day after cath, with clinical signs of right hand 
weakness, with no other signs/symptoms since that time and CT 
scan negative for acute pathology (no MRI done). On [**4-28**], 
patient had another rise in ck and troponin, with rise back up 
to 12 (previously 2). An Echo on [**4-28**] showed EF 40-45%. A 
carotid u/s showed ""no changes from previous"", but by report, 
unsure of previous findings. Patient has reportedly been chest 
pain free over weekend on ntg and heparin gtts. Right groin site 
clean, dry, and intact. Patient referred for venous graft 
intervention. Vital signs upon transfer BP 170/77, 130/55 
post-hydral and lopressor, hr 60s sinus, afebrile, sat 2lnc 98%. 
Bilateral wheezes.  
In cath lab, cobalt chronium, BMS stent placed in proximal [**12-2**] 
of SVG to RCA, where a 70% stenosis was identified.  
ROS+ for claudication symptoms in her lower extremities after 
walking distance. + nasal symptoms thought [**1-1**] to seasonal 
allergies.  

 
Past Medical History:
1. CAD - MI complicated by cardiogenic shock in [**3006**], leading to 
CABG with LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG to PLV  
2. [**Last Name (un) 1531**] [**Doctor Last Name **] aortic valve replacement.  
3. PVD - s/p aortobifemoral bypass graft with left renal artery 
bypass  
4. Abdominal aortic aneurysm - repaired 2002  
5. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation  
6. Chronic renal insufficiency - baseline Cr 2.5 with acute 
failure with creatinine rise to 5.0. Renal artery angioplasty in 
[**3006**].  
7. GI bleed - unsure of nature of bleed  
8. Hypertension  
9. Hyperlipidemia - untreated due to side effects  
10. Pulmonary hypertension  
11. Right carotid stenosis - CEW 2001  
Cardiac Risk Factors: Dyslipidemia, Hypertension, atrial 
fibrillation  
Cardiac History: CABG - LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG to PLV

Pertinent Results:
CXR - Single AP view of the chest in upright position 
demonstrate patient to be status post CABG. There is pulmonary 
vascular congestion with interstitial edema. No evidence of 
pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is 
enlarged.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion with 
interstitial edema representing CHF.
.
ECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular 
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is mildly depressed (ejection fraction 40-50 percent) 
secondary to severe hypokinesis of the basal and midventricular 
segments of the inferior and posterior walls. There is no 
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is 
normal. Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed. 
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

[**3013-5-8**] ECHO

Conclusions:  
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric 
left  
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top 
 
normal/borderline dilated. There is moderate regional left 
ventricular  
systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral akinesis and 
hypokinesis  
elsewhere. Overall left ventricular systolic function is 
moderately depressed.  
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more 
depressed given  
the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricular 
cavity is  
mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears 
depressed.  
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more 
depressed given  
the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are  
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) 
aortic  
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened.  
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
regurgitation jet is  
eccentric. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
Moderate [2+]  
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic  
hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The 
end-diastolic  
pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting 
pulmonary artery  
diastolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most 
likely  
represents a fat pad.  
  
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**3013-5-4**], the 
left and  
right ventricles are now more dilated and left and right 
ventricular systolic  
function now appears more depressed. Mitral and tricuspid 
regurgitation are  
now more prominent.  

[**3013-5-6**] RENAL ULTRASOUND

RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 9.5 cm. There is 
mild increased echogenicity of the renal cortex. No 
hydronephrosis or stones. Bladder is partially full and 
unremarkable. Left kidney was not visualized, and by report of 
the patient, is scarred and atrophic.

IMPRESSION:
1. Mild increased echogenicity of the renal cortex consistent 
with chronic parenchymal renal disease. No evidence of 
obstruction.
2. Non-visualization of the left kidney.

[**3013-5-3**]  CARDIAC CATH

COMMENTS:     Successful bare metal stenting of a SVG-RCA 
stenosis using 
distal protection followed by a 3.5x15mm Vision stent 
post-dilated to 
20atm using a NC balloon. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Successful bare metal stenting of a SVG-RCA graft using a 
3.5x15mm 
Vision BMS postdilated to 4.0mm.

Brief Hospital Course:
CORONARY - Patient had stent placement in SVG to RCA.  
Integrillin was continued for 18 hrs, initiated on aspirin 325mg 
daily, plavix 75mg daily, and beta blockade.  A statin was not 
started due to her reactions to statins in the past.  An 
echocardiogram post-cath showed mild hypokinesis.  Her cardiac 
enzymes trended down. 
.
CHF: The patient was somewhat volumed overloaded on admission. 
She underwent cath without complications and four hours later 
she went into flash pulmonary edema with no EKG changes. She was 
transferred briefly to the CCU, where she was aggressively 
diuresed and placed on standing hydralazine and isosorbide 
dinitrate. On the floor, she continued to receive 60 mg IV lasix 
bid for diuresis and she stabilized, was comfortable off oxygen 
and ambulatory and wanted to be discharged on [**5-6**]. However, by 
then she had not been at baseline for 24 hours yet, so she was 
encouraged to stay. Early on [**3013-5-7**], she had a NSTEMI with 
troponins up to 7, and went into severe pulmonary edema 
requiring face mask, with severe respiratory distress that did 
not respond to 160 mg IV lasix. She desatted to 87% on 2 L nc. 
She was transferred back to the CCU. She did not respond to a 
total of 180 mg IV lasix and was put on a lasix drip. She also 
received metolazone 10 mg PO. She diuresed 5 liters on this 
regimen however her creatinine bumped to >4 (baseline around 
2.5.) She was on a nitro gtt for 2 days as well in the CCU. She 
was not intubated and required a facemask briefly. She was 
weaned to room air before transfer to the floor on the 11th and 
was transferred off lasix in view of the ARF. On the floor, she 
remained off lasix for 24 hours with no edema. On the 12th, she 
was put on 40 mg PO lasix qd, and she tolerated this regimen 
well, with appropriate diuresis and creatinine down to 3.5. At 
the same time, metoprolol was increased to 75 tid and nitro was 
d/c.
.
NSTEMI: The patient had a cardiac enzyme leak during this 
exacerbation.  Her EKG was unchanged from prior.  This NSTEMI 
may have been causal or a result of her CHF exacerbation.  We 
discussed therapy options with the patient.  She did not want 
any further cardiac catheterizations so we opted to treat 
medically. She also has a hx of A Fibrillation. She remained in 
sinus rhythm, and not on coumadin due to a history of GI bleed.'
.
RENAL FAILURE: Acute on chronic renal impairment: The patient's 
baseline is 2.5, which increased to 3.5 upon diuresis on the 
floor. She went to CCU with creatinine of 3.5 (up from baseline 
of 2.5).  It rose to 4.2 then trended to 4.1 prior to transfer 
back to the floor.  We felt this was most likely c/w contrast 
nephropathy plus possibly some prerenal azotemia in the setting 
of aggressive diuresis.  Thus, the team held off on aggressive 
diuresis the day of transfer to the floor. As above, lasix was 
held for 24 hours, then restarted at 40 mg PO qd, with 
creatinine stabilized at 3.5.
Patient was initially given D5W with bicarb pre-cath and also 
initially post-cath, but had to be discontinued with development 
of flash pulmonary edema.

keep K+>4.2. Repleted prn.

     CHEST, SINGLE AP FILM
     
     History of pulmonary edema.
     
     Status post CABG.  There is cardiomegaly with interstitial pulmonary edema and
     small bilateral pleural effusions.  In the absence of remote studies,
     underlying chronic interstitial disease cannot be ruled out.  No pneumothorax
     or evidence for new confluent airspace consolidation.
     
     IMPRESSION:  CHF with probable interstitial pulmonary edema, but cannot rule
     out underlying chronic interstitial disease.  Slight prominence of both hila
     could be related to pulmonary hypertension.
