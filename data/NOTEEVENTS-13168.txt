                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Large ovarian mass seen on outside CT.
     
     Post menopausal
     
     PELVIC US: A very large cystic pelvic mass with septations demonstrating color
     and doppler flow is identified. It is displacing the uterus anteriorly. It is
     unclear which side of the adnexa it arises from, as it extends across the
     midline and obscures visualization of the ovaries. Its dimensions are roughly
     17.6 x 10.3 x 19.3 cm.
     
     The endometrium is slightly thickened at 9mm, but appears homgenous.
     
     IMPRESSION: Large complex ovarian mass very concerning for neoplasm.

     INDICATION: Pelvic mass.
     
     No prior studies are available for comparison.
     
     PA & LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There is mild left ventriculomegaly without
     evidence of failure. Mediastinal contours are within normal limits. Biapical
     thickening is present. A nonspecific reticular pattern is present in the right
     upper lobe. There is also a small, possible calcified granuloma in the right
     upper lobe. Right lateral pleural thickening is also seen adjacent to the
     right upper lobe. There are changes in the right 7th rib laterally, which may
     represent old fracture. The right lung findings are not indicative of an acute
     process, and may be related to old trauma or infection. No pleural effusions
     are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities. Nonspecific reticular
     pattern, pleural changes, and rib changes in the right upper lobe as described
     above.

Admission Date:  [**3450-12-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**3451-1-6**]

Date of Birth:   [**3389-6-19**]       Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital Ward Name **] ICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an addendum to discharge
summary dated [**3450-12-21**] for [**Known patient firstname **] [**Known patient lastname 8623**], a 61
year-old female with chronic lung and liver disease who
presented with acute adult respiratory distress syndrome
after total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy.  Initial presentation, past medical
history, allergies, medications, social history, family
history, admission physical examination, laboratory studies
and hospital course from [**3450-12-4**] through [**3450-12-21**] has been summarized in prior note.  This addendum
will summarize hospital course from [**12-21**] through
[**1-6**].

1.  Respiratory failure:  The patient received a tracheostomy
on [**12-20**].  She continued a slow weaning off mechanical
ventilation, which required massive diuresis including
Furosemide intravenous drip.  A chest x-ray [**12-27**]
showed persistence of both pulmonary edema and left
retrocardiac opacity.  Aggressive diuresis continued.  It is
noted that she diureses well to Furosemide 80 mg intravenous
push.  Beginning on the evening of [**12-27**] the patient
was able to tolerate tracheostomy collar with oxygen mask for
short periods of time.  Starting on [**1-3**] the patient
was able to tolerate tracheostomy collar and oxygen mask
continuously and has been free of mechanical ventilation for
three days.  Typical vital signs on tracheostomy collar with
Passey Muir speaking valve, respiratory rate 15 to 28, oxygen
saturation 94 to 100% on 10 liter tracheostomy mask, arterial
blood gas 7.49/37/110.  The patient should have her Passy
Muir valve on with tracheostomy cuff deflated during the day
and valve removed with tracheostomy cuff inflated at night.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient had hypotension earlier on
admission as detailed on prior note.  She continued on
Hydrocortisone and Fluticasone for relative adrenal
insufficiency through [**12-24**].  However, after
corticosteroids were stopped, her pressure became mildly low
requiring intravenous Vasopressors.  An infectious workup was
negative.  ACTH stimulation test was repeated and showed 11
mm per deciliter at baseline and 19 mg per deciliter after 60
minutes.  Hydrocortisone was restarted at 50 mg intravenous q
6 hours and continued for another seven days through [**12-31**].  On this regimen the patient was no longer hypotensive
and all pressors were discontinued on [**12-25**] and hs not
been started since.  Arterial line was discontinued on
[**1-4**] and cuff pressures have been stable since.

The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response requiring a Digoxin load earlier in the
admission.  She remained rather tachycardic and level was
checked after several days and found to be 0.4.  Digoxin was
again loaded and the dose was increased to 0.25 mg
intravenous q.d.  The level on this dose was 0.9.  Digoxin
was switched to po on [**1-4**] and the Digoxin level should be
repeated on [**1-9**].  The patient has been on intravenous
heparin anticoagulation throughout her hospital stay.  The
intravenous heparin drip was being discontinued on [**1-6**] and the patient should be started on Warfarin 2.5 mg po q
day tonight.  Prothrombin time was international normalized
ratio should be checked on the morning of [**1-9**] and
adjustments should be made at the discretion of the [**Hospital 101**]
rehab and outpatient medical doctors.

3.  Infectious disease:  The patient remained on Vancomycin
and Ceftazidime from [**12-16**] through [**12-26**] for
ventilator associated pneumonia.  She continued to have
intermittent fevers and leukocytosis.  On [**12-25**]
abdominal CT showed ascites, but no obvious infection.
Temperature was 100.8 on [**12-29**], a urinalysis, chest
x-ray and diagnostic paracentesis were unremarkable for
infection.  Her arterial and central venous access were
resighted repeatedly between [**12-29**] and [**1-6**] in
an effort to minimize source of fever.  On [**12-31**] gram
positive coxae grew in one of four blood culture bottles and
this happened again in one of four bottles on [**1-3**] as
well as gram positive coxae growing from the tip of the
arterial line discontinued on [**12-29**].  All of these
cultures grew skin flora such as coagulase negative
staphylococcus and were felt to be skin contamination.  If
the patient continues to have low grade fevers and
leukocytosis repeat surveillance blood cultures should be
checked next week.  At present the patient has been afebrile
for several days, but continues to have a moderate
leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18 to 22.
However, there was no sign of active infection.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient is known to have cirrhosis
diagnosed from an abdominal CT demonstrating nodular liver
edge and ascites.  She has never had signs of
gastrointestinal bleeding, encephalopathy or spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis.  It is unclear whether her ascites was
due solely to fluid overload from hospitalization or due to
persistent liver disease.  She is discharged on low doses of
Furosemide and Spironolactone.  Her fluid status will need to
be reevaluated on a regular basis to determine her long term
need for this diuretic therapy.  The patient has also
received multiple doses of subcutaneous vitamin K for
elevated INR on this admission.  The last dose being one to
two weeks ago.

5.  Hematologic:  The patient has a stable hematocrit
slightly above 30 and has had no active hematologic issues
other then the coagulopathy and leukocytosis described above.

6.  Endocrine:  The patient has been noted to have
hyperglycemia on this admission.  It is not clear how much of
this is due to corticosteroid therapy (now discontinued) and
how much is due to underlying diabetes mellitus.  We are
currently titrating up the patient's NPH insulin to cover
hypoglycemia caused by nocturnal tube feeds.  As of today her
insulin dose is adjusted up to 8 units subQ q.a.m., 18 units
subQ q 6:00 p.m.  Finger stick blood glucoses should continue
to be monitored and NPH insulin adjusted accordingly.

7.  Neurological:  The patient has experienced gradually
resolving delirium over her hospital stay.  She is beginning
to exhibit signs of anxiety and/or sundowning and has been
started on Sertraline 50 mg po q day with prn Zolpidem.
Further therapy for anxiety and insomnia should be considered
based on the patient's clinical presentation.

8.  Fluid and electrolytes:  The patient received aggressive
Furosemide diuresis as above.  This resulted in multiple
electrolyte abnormalities including hypokalemia requiring
aggressive potassium repletion as well as Acetazolamide for
severe metabolic alkalosis and Spironolactone.  In addition,
the patient developed hypernatremia requiring several liters
per day of free water repletion.  As the patient reached
uvolemia the need for Furosemide, potassium and free water
decreased.  In the last several days the patient has become
hyponatremic with a serum sodium of approximately 130.  All
free water supplementation has been discontinued although
Lasix and Spironolactone are continued at low doses as
described above.  The patient's serum sodium should be
monitored twice weekly along with potassium, and oral
anticoagulation management as described above.  Serum urea
nitrogen and creatinine should be monitored as well.

9.  Nutrition:  The patient tolerated a blue dye swallowing
study without aspiration on [**1-3**].  In addition a
oropharyngeal swallow showed only mild dysphagia with no
aspiration.  A Dobbhoff nasogastric narrow bore feeding tube
was placed and the patient is to be given tube feeds
nocturnally, Promote with fiber at 90 ml per hour until 7:00
p.m. to 7:00 a.m.  D[**MD Number 278**] the day, her Passy Muir valve
should be in and she should be allowed to eat a low sodium
consistent carbohydrate diet of pureed and thin liquids.  She
should only eat with her Passy Muir valve in.  Feeding tube
can be discontinued at such time as the patient is able to
take sufficient po to nourish herself.

10.  Access:  Subclavian central venous and radial arterial
lines have been discontinued.  Tracheostomy dates to [**12-20**].  Dobbhoff dates to [**12-29**].  The patient has had an
indwelling Foley catheter since admission, which should be
discontinued at such time as the patient is able to manage
her own urination.

11.  Prophylaxis:  The patient should receive Coumadin with
monitoring of international normalized ratio for both deep
venous thrombosis and atrial fibrillation prophylaxis.  She
should continue to receive a proton pump inhibitor as she was
on this as an outpatient.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable on transfer to [**Hospital3 8624**] Rehab in [**Location (un) **].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Folic acid 1 mg po q day, Thiamine
100 mg po q day, Lansoprazole 30 mg q day, Metoprolol 25 mg
po b.i.d., Coumadin 2.5 mg po q.h.s. check INR [**1-9**] and
adjust according to results.  Sertraline 50 mg po q.d., NPH
insulin 6 units subcutaneous q.a.m., 18 units subcutaneous q
6:00 p.m., please monitor finger stick blood glucoses and
adjust NPH dose as needed.  Regular insulin sliding scale.
Digoxin 0.25 mg po q day please check Digoxin level on
[**1-9**] and adjust dose if needed.  Furosemide 40 mg po q
day, Spironolactone 100 mg po q day, please monitor daily
weights and fluid status as well as twice weekly serum
electrolytes BUN and creatinine, adjust diuresis as necessary
with the potential with the discontinued diuresis entirely if

     INDICATION: Emphysema. Pulmonary edema.
     
     IMPRESSION: Increased pulmonary edema probably due to congestive heart
     failure. Focal opacity in the left upper lobe and right lower lobe:
     superimposed pneumonia or aspiration versus asymmetric pulmonary edema.
     
     COMMENT: Portable AP radiograph of the chest is reviewed, and compared with
     previous study of [**3450-11-28**].
     
     There is increased pulmonary edema with mild cardiomegaly probably due to mild
     congestive heart failure. In addition, there are patchy opacities seen in the
     left upper lobe and right lower lobe, which is worrisome for superimposed
     pneumonia or aspiration. Alternatively, these opacities could be asymmetric
     pulmonary edema.
     
     Again note is made of biapical thickening which have been described
     previously. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.

     INDICATION: Acute respiratory distress status post line placement.
     
     TECHNIQUE: A single portable AP view of the chest is compared with 3 hours
     prior.
     
     FINDINGS: There has been interval intubation, with the tip 4 cm from the
     carina.  No central lines are visualized.  There is an NG tube with the tip in
     the stomach.  Again seen are bilateral lung opacities with the appearance of
     an alveolar pattern combined with an interstitial pattern, which generally
     looks stble compared to the study of 3 hours prior, although at the right lung
     base there appears to be a slight increase in opacity.  The heart is not
     enlarged.  There is calcification of a normal-appearing aorta.  Metallic clips
     are seen in the right upper quadrant.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Good position of endotracheal tube.
     
     2. Slight worsening of air-space/interstitial opacity, particularly at the
     right lung base.  The etiology is uncertain.  The appearance is less likely
     that of pulmonary edema, and, given the unremarkable appearance of the heart
     and lack of pleural effusions, the appearance seems more appropriate to that
     of an inflammatory/toxic/allergic change.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Acute respiratory distress, s/p Swan-Ganz placement.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Single portable AP view of the chest is compared with 3 hours
     prior.
     
     FINDINGS: There has been interval placement of a right sided Swan-Ganz
     catheter, with the tip in the right main pulmonary artery. ETT is unchanged in
     position, 3 cm from the carina. There is an NG tube in place with the tip in
     the stomach. The cardiac silhouette appears unchanged. There has been interval
     worsening over the last 3 hours of the bilateral air space and interstitial
     process, more on the right than on the left. Also noted at this study is a
     prominence of the azygous vein as compared to the prior studies. Again noted
     are right upper quadrant abdominal clips.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) Interval worsening of pulmonary process as described on prior
     study. 2) Prominence of azygous vein demonstrates increasing right sided heart
     failure, likely due to the pulmonary process.

     FINDINGS:  There has been interval worsening of bilateral patchy air space
     consolidations, suggestive of worsening pulmonary edema.  There may be focal
     opacities in the left upper lung and right middle lobe, such that superimposed
     pneumonia cannot be excluded. There are no pleural effusions.  The heart is
     not enlarged.  No pneumothorax.  The soft tissue and osseous structures are
     unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Worsened, asymmetric congestive failure.  Superimposed pneumonia

NSG PROGRESS NOTE 7p-7a
Restless noc. Neuro: Pt restless and agitated. Opens eyes on command and is oriented X2. Needs reminding of time. Pt was more alert at start of shift and throughout the noc has become increasingly agitated. Ativan given 1mg @ 2200 along with trazadone. Shortly after pt became hypotensive and lethargic so 0200 dose held.  Pt occassionally has lower extremity tremors that self resolve. Ativan 1mg also given in a divided dose @ 0500 d/t restlessness/agitation

CV: As mentioned Bp dropped after giving sedatives. Bp low 68-70's/ 30-40's increased slightly with stimulation. A total of two 250cc NS boluses given with some effect. Since, BP has been maintained in the 90-105/40's (MAPs>60). HR NSR 90's no ectopy noted.  Extremities warm with fair pedal pulses. Two PIV'S patent.

RESP: Lung sounds difficult to assess at times d/t agitation and moaning. At start of shift she was only on 50% FM with sats 88-90% Placed on 6l nc with same effect so FT added with 70%cool air mist. Sats most of the noc have been >95% on these settings. Resp when calm in the 20's, increasing with agitation 30-40's.  Lungs sounds at start of shift were clear with some faint crackles in the bases. Currently her crackles appear to be increasing however she's had no change in sats or resp. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1945**] aware of progressive failure and possible need of lasix, however, her Bp as mentioned is borderline. Will cont to assess. CXR ordered for am.

GI: Pt tolerated small sips of water and actually swallowed her pm meds when she was more alert. ABD very distended ?baseline. No BM.

GU: Urine output very minimal in early evening...amber/clear. Improved somewhat with IVB's and sips H2O. Currently still borderline, ave 25-35/hr.  ? Lasix this am if Bp stable.

SKIN: abdominal sutures intact. No drainage. Right antecube sl. pink d/t tape removal.

RESP: AC with 400 TV, 50%FIO2, PEEP 12.5, RR 22.  There was a problem with sedating her enough b/c her autopeep was at 5.  IT has been down to 1 for the past 24 hrs but now is back up to 4.  PIP around 28 avg. She is not overbreathing the vent much at this point but has needed more suction today.  She yields thin tan from the ETT tube in small amounts but copious oral secretions of bilious yellow.  Br Sounds range from coarse to crackles in the bases.

GI: OG tube to LCS to help control oral secretions. MDs wanted to try tube feedings at 10cc/h even though she has had tons of the same secretions from her OG tube as her mouth. IF she is not hooked up to suction it startes oozing from her mouth.  AT 1700 her residual was greater than 200cc so I clamped her for awhile then hooked her back up to suction when resp. told me her autopeep was going up again and her oral secretions picked up as well.  She has been given lactulose and dulcolax everyday but has not stooled in the four days I have had her except one small bit of liquid stool. She has had absent bowel sounds. Her girth is soft, distended and the OB team said that has been the norm for her and they are not concerned about it.

     INDICATION:  ARDS and persistent hypotension. Evaluate for abdominal abscess
     or bowel obstruction.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases through the pubic symphysis with the administration of oral and IV
     contrast. Additional coronal reformatted images were performed.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There are moderate sized bilateral pleural
     effusions associated with bibasilar atelectasis. There is subtle ground glass
     opacities in both lung bases. The heart appears mildly enlarged. The liver
     demonstrates a slightly nodular contour predominantly involving the left lobe
     without evidence of focal masses. There is a diminuitive left portal vein. The
     patient is status post cholecystectomy.  The pancreas is atrophic. The spleen
     is within the upper limits of normal in size. The adrenal glands and kidneys
     are unremarkable.  There is a large amount of free abdominal and pelvic fluid.
     The abdominal vasculature demonstrates calcifications along the distal aorta
     and iliac arteries.  There is no definite mesenteric or retroperitoneal
     lymphadenopathy.  Incidental note is made of a duodenal diverticulum.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There is extensive subcutaneous edema extending
     along both flank regions to the hips bilaterally. Again noted is the large
     amount of pelvic fluid.  There is scattered sigmoid diverticulae without
     evidence of diverticulitis.  The rectum and bladder are unremarkable. There is
     no definite deep pelvic lymphadenopathy.
     
     The osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) The liver has a slightly nodular contour in association with a diminuitive
     left portal vein and borderline splenomegaly. These findings in conjunction
     with the ascites is concerning for chronic liver disease such as cirrhosis.

     INDICATION:  ARDS and persistent hypotension. Evaluate for abdominal abscess
     or bowel obstruction.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases through the pubic symphysis with the administration of oral and IV
     contrast. Additional coronal reformatted images were performed.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There are moderate sized bilateral pleural
     effusions associated with bibasilar atelectasis. There is subtle ground glass
     opacities in both lung bases. The heart appears mildly enlarged. The liver
     demonstrates a slightly nodular contour predominantly involving the left lobe
     without evidence of focal masses. There is a diminuitive left portal vein. The
     patient is status post cholecystectomy.  The pancreas is atrophic. The spleen
     is within the upper limits of normal in size. The adrenal glands and kidneys
     are unremarkable.  There is a large amount of free abdominal and pelvic fluid.
     The abdominal vasculature demonstrates calcifications along the distal aorta
     and iliac arteries.  There is no definite mesenteric or retroperitoneal
     lymphadenopathy.  Incidental note is made of a duodenal diverticulum.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There is extensive subcutaneous edema extending
     along both flank regions to the hips bilaterally. Again noted is the large
     amount of pelvic fluid.  There is scattered sigmoid diverticulae without
     evidence of diverticulitis.  The rectum and bladder are unremarkable. There is
     no definite deep pelvic lymphadenopathy.
     
     The osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) The liver has a slightly nodular contour in association with a diminuitive
     left portal vein and borderline splenomegaly. These findings in conjunction
     with the ascites is concerning for chronic liver disease such as cirrhosis.
     2) Diverticulosis without evidnece of diverticulitis.
     3) Extensive arterial calcifications.
     4) Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
     5) No evidence of abdominal abscess.
     6) Anasarca.
                                                                 (Over)

     There is no significant interval change in position of the lines and tubes.
     The cardiac size is prominent. The mediastinal contour is also prominent,
     presumably due to the portable technique. Again, there is bilateral diffuse
     interstitial and alveolar opacities, indicative of pulmonary edema (including
     cardiogenic or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema). There is no new confluent area
     of airspace consolidation when compared to the prior study. There is probable
     small right pleural effusion.

     edema), no significant interval change.

     INDICATION:  Acute respiratory distress after hysterectomy.  Question
     progression of infiltrates.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest was compared with one day
     prior.
     
     FINDINGS:  The ETT remains 4 cm from the carina.  There is a right-sided IJ
     catheter, terminating in the mid SVC.  Again, an NGT terminates within the
     stomach.  There is continuing opacification of the bilateral lungs, with loss
     of parenchymal detail at the right lung base.  Additionally, there is an
     increasing dense opacity of the left lung base, with air bronchogram.  Again
     seen is cardiomegaly.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Interval opacification of the bilateral lungs with an alveolar
     pattern.  Left lower lobe and lingula consolidation.  The right lower lobe
     likely represents a pleural effusion; LV failure cannot be excluded.

     INDICATION:  Acute respiratory distress following tracheostomy.
     
     The heart, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable in appearance since the
     prior study.  There is unchanged consolidation/collapse at the left lower lobe
     retrocardiac space and costophrenic angle.  There is otherwise decreased
     perihilar haziness and hazy bilateral opacities.  There is a subtle lucency
     along the right cardiophrenic angle, not seen on the prior study.  There has
     been interval removal of the endotracheal tube and placement of a trcheostomy
     tube with tip approximately 4 cm above the carina.  A right IJ catheter tip
     extends to the mid-SVC.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Unchanged left lower lobe consolidation/collapse.
     2)  Improving pulmonary edema.
     3)  Subtle lucency along the right cardiophrenic angle is new since the prior
     study.  Given the patient's history, it is difficult to entirely exclude an
     anteromedial pneumothorax. Recommend repeat radiograph in upright or
     decubitus position for further assessment of this finding.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Respiratory distress following surgery due to volume overload. 
     
     Compared to previous study of two days earlier.
     
     The radiograph is suboptimal due to exclusion of the lung apices from the
     film.  The distal-most tip of a tracheostomy tube is identified and appears to
     abut the lateral wall of the trachea, but this may relate to rotation of the
     patient rather than true asymmetric positioning.  A right IJ central venous
     catheter is in satisfactory position.
     
     The heart remains enlarged, and there is persistent vascular engorgement and
     perihilar haziness.  No confluent areas of consolidation are seen in either
     lung.  There has been interval improved aeration in the left retrocardiac
     region.
     
     Previously reported right cardiophrenic angle lucency is no longer visualized.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Slight improvement in degree of CHF with residual perihilar haziness and
     vascular engorgement.

     COMPARISON:  [**3450-12-25**]
     
     FINDINGS:  This exam is extremely limited due to underpenetration and patient
     rotation.  Left subclavian line tip cannot be definitely identified due to
     numerous other overlying wires.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours as well as
     lung fields cannot be evaluated due to extreme rotation.  Repeat examination
     is recommended after repositioning external wires.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Left subclavian tip cannot be assessed due to overlying wires.
     Recommend repeat once wires have been repositioned.

     left subclavian line placement.
     
     Single frontal chest radiograph is compared with prior chest radiograph dated
     [**3450-12-24**].
     
     There is interval placement of a left subclavian catheter, terminating in the
     junction of the SVC and right atrium. There is no definite evidence of
     pneumothorax.  The chest radiograph is grossly degraded by respiratory motion.
     There is no interval significant change in positions of the right IJ catheter
     and tracheostomy tube. There is a possible supporting tube in the upper
     abdomen, which could represent the NG tube but is difficult to visualize due
     to motion. There is persistent cardiomegaly and probably interval improvement
     of CHF. This is difficult to evaluate due to motion.

     INDICATION:  Acute respiratory distress after hysterectomy.  S/P line
     placement.
     
     PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST, [**12-31**] at approximately 9:20 P.M.:  Exam is compared to
     earlier study of approximately 8 P.M.  Central line has been inserted with the
     tip now in the region of the right atrium.  Tracheostomy tube and NGT remain
     in place.  Compared to the study approximately 11 hours earlier there are
     increasing effusions.  The slightly mottled appearance to the lung fields with
     suggestion air bronchogram, in particular as seen in the upper lung zones,
     suggests interstitial fluid vs. pattern of ARDS superimposed on
     failure/effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Advancement of the central line into the region of the right
     atrium.  Increased haziness to the lung fields suggesting increasing pleural
     effusions vs. increasing congestive failure.  Note should be made that
     consideration should be given to the presence of ARDS.  Clinical correlation
     advised.

     INDICATION:  61 year old woman on vent with slow to wean.  Post-surgical ARDS.
      Confirm NG tube placement.
     
     PORTABLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Comparison [**3451-1-2**].  A left-sided central
     venous line is present with its tip in the right atrium, unchanged compared to
     prior.  A nasogastric tube is present with its tip extending into the proximal
     stomach.  If a side port is present, this likely resides in the region of the
     gastroesophageal junction.  Tracheostomy tube is present.  There has been
     interval improvement in bilateral lung aeration, although there are persistent
     increased bilateral interstitial markings.
     
     Cholecystectomy clips are present within the right upper quadrant.  Contrast
     material outlines loops of non-distended large bowel.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Nasogastric tube with tip in the proximal stomach.  Recommend
     advancement of tube.
