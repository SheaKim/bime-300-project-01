                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  73-year-old man with lesion along the right optic tract and
     chiasm.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior studies from [**Hospital6 3610**] not
     available for comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1-weighted images with gadolinium enhancement through
     the brain.  Additional 3D time-of-flight MR angiogram images with 3D
     reconstructions.
     
     MRI BRAIN FINDINGS:  There is a subtlely enhancing mass centered over the
     right optic tract and chiasm.  The enhancement also spreads anteriorly
     involving the right optic nerve.  Prior studies not available for comparison.
     There is at least one other focal area of enhancement in the left temporal
     parietal lobe.  Superiorly in the right parietal lobe near the vertex, there
     is a punctate area of possible enhancement, which may be artifactual.  These
     lesions are not well appreciated on the MP-RAGE sequences.
     
     MRA HEAD FINDINGS:  MR angiogram images demonstrate patency and normal signal
     flow patterns of the anterior and posterior vasculature without
     hemodynamically significant stenosis or aneurysmal dilation.  The mass
     centered in the right optic tract and chiasm does not invade or involve the
     local adjacent vessels.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Subtlely enhancing lesion centered on the right optic chiasm and tract,
     with at least one other small focus of enhancement in the left
     temporal/parietal lobe, and a question of punctate enhancement in the right
     superior parietal lobe. Old studies are not available for comparison, however,
     the imaging characteristics are concerning for metastatic disease or less
     likely lymphoma.  Glioma appears much less likely, however, our assessment is
     limited without T2-weighted imaging.
     2) Normal-calibered and patent cerebral vasculature.

Head MRI;[**3300-7-10**] 
Showed an enhancing lesion in the 
right optic nerve, right optic tract, and the optic chiasm. 
There was also an enhancing spot in the left parietal white 
matter, as well as increase FLAIR and T2 signals in the left 
cerebral peduncle and the left insula. 

EEG: [**3300-8-9**] 
Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the persistent and 
somewhat rhythmic bursts of slowing with some sharp features 
broadly 
over the right hemisphere. This suggests a focal subcortical 
abnormality, likely of a structural or distructive nature. The 
rhythmic 
appearance of slowing and occasional sharp features raises 
concern for 
the possibility of lateralized epileptogenesis, but there were 
no clear 
seizures during the recording. An atomic correlation would be of 

interest if clinically indicated. Reflective of some drowsiness, 

over the left side.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 year-old male underwent right craniotomy for resection of 
right optic track glioma, and tissue biopsy  under general 
anesthesia on 8/25/5.No intraoperative complications occurred. 
easily extubated. Patient closely monitored  in the PACU for Q1 
hour neuro check and SBP goal of 100-140 mmHg ovenight.Star [**Male First Name (un) **] 
to taper his Decadron POD#1 to mg BID until [**Doctor Last Name **] in the brain 
tumor clinic. Postop  Head MRI with/without gadolinium revealed 
status post craniotomy, mass in the optic chiasm is visualized. 
No evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect or hydrocephalus. Signal 
abnormalities in the brain stem and left insular region. No 
evidence of acute infarct.

Patient developed hyponatremia on POD#3, Na 121, started 3% 
sodioum IV fluid restriction initiated and salt tabs able to 
normolize sodium level.On [**8-13**] Na:132 borderline low, continue 
fluid restriction to 1000ml a day. Check serum sodium level 
periodically in rehab. Advanced his diet as tolareted, able to 
void without any difficulty.POD#5 ([**8-9**]) Patient had a 
whitnessed seizure activity by staff, potable EEG showed 
abnormal EEG, dilantin 1 gm load then, 100mg TID 
started.Dilantin 7.6 [**8-11**], [**8-12**] Dilantin level 18 on current 
dose.Reloaded and dose increased to 200mg BID.

On [**3300-8-12**] on morning rounds patient was slow to respond on 
neuro exam , repeated Head CT was stable, later in the day neuro 
exam was better. Spiked a low grade fever 101 pan cultures 
obtained. Urine dipsitick showed trace blood, tr ketone, tarce 
protein, glucose 250, urobil: 12, no leukocit. blod culutere an 
durine cultures are pending, if they becaome postive will 
contact with patient for treatment.Bilateral lower extremity 
doppler study was negative for DVT. Stures removed on [**3300-8-13**].

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  74-year-old man with history of glioma, right-sided chest pain and
     new interstitial infiltrate.  Rule out PE.
     
     There are no previous CT scans available for comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT angiogram of the chest.  Precontrast, low dose images were
     obtained followed by images at the  pulmonary artery phase.  Coronal and
     sagittal images are also provided.
     
     FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  Mild atherosclerotic changes are seen
     within the aorta.  Multiple pulmonary emboli are seen arising at the division
     of the right pulmonary artery, throughout the upper, middle, and inferior
     lobes with less compromised in the later one, associated with wedge shaped
     subpleural areas of infiltration consistent with pulmonary infarcts.  In the
     left hemithorax, there is also pulmonary emboli with less compromise compared
     to the right side, but also associated with small peripheral subpleural areas
     probably resolving infarcts.  Subplaural emphysematous changes are seen in
     upper lobes. There is no pleural effusion.  Multiple lymphadenopathies are
     seen in the prevascular and peritracheal regions.  The biggest is located
     pretracheal and measuring 6 mm.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pulmonary embolism associated with peripheral pulmonary
     infarcts.
     
     The findings were discussed with Dr. [**Known patient firstname 2684**] [**Known patient lastname 3613**] at the moment of the
     dictation.

     MRI OF THE BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST ON [**11-8**].
     
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Anaplastic astrocytoma treated with surgery, chemotherapy
     and radiation therapy.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted images, axial T2-
     weighted, susceptibility FLAIR and diffusion-weighted images were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:
     There is an enhancing mass centered in the right optic chiasm and tract, which
     is decreased in size slightly compared to [**3300-7-30**].  The enhancement has become
     more intense.  The surrounding FLAIR hyperintensity is approximately
     unchanged.
     
     Where subtle enhancement was seen in the left superior temporal gyrus,
     posteriorly, there is now an enhancing 5-mm nodule.  No edema surrounds this
     lesion.  The punctate lesion in the anterior superior right parietal lobe is
     less conspicuous.  Again, there is no edema associated with this lesion.
     
     There is patchy T2 hyperintensity in the deep cerebral white matter.  There is
     cortical T2 hyperintensity in the posterior half of the left Insula,
     unchanged.  There is bilateral brainstem T2 hyperintensity, more prominent in
     the left where there is involvement of the cerebral peduncle in the inferior
     extension into the pons, both of which appear somewhat swollen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  The enhancing nodule in the posterior superior left temporal lobe has
     enlarged.
     
     2.  The enhancing tumor in the right optic chiasm and tract has decreased
     somewhat in size and there is less mass effect on the right aspect of the
     third ventricle.  The degree of enhancement has increased compared to the
     prior study.
     
     3.  The punctate enhancing lesion in the superior right parietal lobe is
     unchanged.
     
     4.  There remain areas of abnormal T2 hyperintensity in the left Insula and in
     the brainstem.
     
     5.  The right craniotomy and underlying slight dural enhancement are again
     noted.  There is new opacification of the left maxillary sinus.
                                                                 (Over)

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted sequences were obtained through
     the brain with multiplanar post-gadolinium T1 imaging as well as arterial
     spin-labeled perfusion imaging.
     
     HISTORY:  Right optic anaplastic astrocytoma status post chemo, whole brain
     radiation and craniotomy.
     
     FINDINGS:  Today's examination is compared with the prior from [**3300-11-8**].  Since the prior examination, there has been no significant change in
     either the pattern of enhancement or the pattern of T2 signal abnormality.
     Again, there is a additional small focus of enhancement within the mid left
     temporal lobe, which is stable.  The enhancing tumor at the right optic chiasm
     and tract is stable in size and enhancement pattern.  The mild mass effect
     upon third ventricle persists.  The adjacent T2 signal hyperintensities are
     stable, including the three rounded foci of increased T2 signal within the
     brainstem. Two of these appear in the left cerebral peduncle and one within
     the right peduncle, as before. Multiple foci of increased T2 signal within the
     periventricular white matter of both cerebral hemisphres and the centrum
     semiovale of both sides, as well as along the left insular surface.  Again,
     these changes are stable.
     
     No new areas of abnormal enhancement are appreciated.  There is no evidence of
     hydrocephalus, and the size and the shape of the lateral ventricles are
     stable.  There is a small epidural collection just deep to the right-sided
     craniotomy, which is also stable since the prior examination.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No significant change since prior examination.  No new areas of
     enhancement.
     
     The enhancing tumor in the right optic chiasm and tract is stable in size and
     enhancement pattern.
     
     There is a stable enhancing nodule in the posterior-superior left temporal
     lobe, as before.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Fall, evaluate progression of tumor.  
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain were obtained.
     Gadolinium and diffusion-weighted images were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  Todays examination is compared to the MRI of [**3300-11-8**] and
     [**3300-12-20**].  The enhancing tumor at the right optic chiasm and tract is
     stable in size and enhancement pattern.
     
     There has been increase in the size of the previously identified left temporal
     lesion, which now measures 1.5 x 1.1 cm and previously measured 0.6 x 0.4 cm.
     The lesion is hyperintense on T1- and T2- weighted images and shows a rim of
     susceptibility artifact.  There is increased T2 signal in the parenchyma
     adjacent to this focus, which may represent edema or post- radiation change.
     
     Again seen are multiple T2 signal hyperintensities including three rounded
     foci of increased T2 signal within the brainstem.  The appearance is unchanged
     compared to the prior MRI studies.
     
     No new areas of abnormal enhancement are appreciated. There is no evidence of
     hydrocephalus. Again seen is a small epidural collection just deep to the
     right-sided craniotomy, which is stable compared to the prior examinations.
     There is a air-fluid level in the left maxillary sinus and thickening of the
     right maxillary sinus and left ethmoid air cells.
     
     IMPRESSION:  
     1.  No significant change in appearance of right optic chiasm tumor.
     2.  Increased size of mass in the posterior-superior left temporal lobe. New
     T1 hyperintensity in this may may indicate hemorrhage.  Enhancement cannot be
     assessed.  This may represent enlarging tumor or a focus of radiation treated
     tumor.
     3.  Air fluid level in left maxillary sinus.
     
     
     
     
     
                                                                 (Over)
