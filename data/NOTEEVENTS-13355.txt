                                     FINAL REPORT
     CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:
     
     INDICATION:  Right upper lobe infiltrate.  [**Female First Name (un) 9710**] line sepsis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial chest CT was performed following administration of 100 cc of
     Optiray IV.
     
     CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is diffuse patchy ground-glass attenuation
     involving all pulmonary lobes.  There is thickening of the intralobular
     septae, with a somewhat nodular appearance.  These most likely represent
     pulmonary edema, although [**Female First Name (un) **] pneumonia could have this appearance.  In
     the posterolateral aspect of the right upper lobe, there is a pleurally-based,
     wedge-shaped consolidation with a small focus of low attenuation centrally.
     This may represent pneumonia with central necrosis, vs. aseptic embolus.
     
     On soft tissue windows, vascular stents are noted within the brachiocephalic
     veins.  The heart size is normal.  Right hilar adenopathy is noted, measuring
     2.3 X 1.5 cm.  Soft tissue density is noted to surround the right hilar
     vessels, likely indicating lymphadenopathy.  There appears to be attenuation
     of the pulmonary arteries, distally.  This raises the suspicion for pulmonary
     emboli.  However, this is not a dedicated CT angiogram.  An additional filling
     defect is noted within the left portion of the left atrium, measuring 10 mm.
     Correlation with echocardiography is recommended to exclude thrombotic
     phenomenon.
     
     Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen reveals hepatosplenomegaly, which can
     be seen in the setting of sepsis.
     
     Bone windows reveal no suspicious osseous abnormalities.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Diffuse ground-glass attenuation involving all lobes, with a reticular
     nodular appearance, most likely indicating pulmonary edema, although this can
     be seen with [**Female First Name (un) **] pneumonia.
     
     2)  Right upper lobe peripheral consolidation with central low attenuation
     that is concerning for pneumonia with central necrosis vs. septic embolus.
     
     The clinical team caring for Ms. [**Known patient lastname 14980**] was notified of these findings at
     the time of the exam.

     INDICATION:  Chronic short gut syndrome on TPN with question of septic emboli
     by chest CT.  Evaluate for intraabdominal source of sepsis.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT torso [**3095-2-8**]
     
     TECHNIQUE: Multiple axial images from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis
     were obtained following the administration of oral contrast as well as 150 cc
     of optiray due to patient debility.
     
     ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The lung bases are unremarkable.  The spleen appears
     enlarged.  There are multiple small foci of gas within the biliary system. The
     bile ducts do not appear dilated.  There are no focal liver abnormalities.
      The patient is status post cholecystectomy.  Percutaneous gastrostomy tube is
     noted within the stomach.  The pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are
     unremarkable.  The bowel enhances, but does not appear dilated.
     
     PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Suprapubic tube is noted within the bladder.  Left
     sided femoral line and vascular stent are noted.  The bladder and uterus are
     unremarkable.  There are no adnexal masses.  There is trace free pelvic fluid.
      No inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.  Note
     is made however of two small pockets of gas within the subcutaneous tissues of
     the right abdomen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Gas within  nondilated biliary tree.  Per discussion with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 14982**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14983**], there has been NO recent ERCP or other instrumentation to account
     for this. The etiology is unclear.

     INDICATIONS:  Systemic vasculitis.  Right upper lobe consolidation. Systemic
     [**Female First Name (un) **]. 
     
     TECHNIQUE:   Axial chest CT was performed following the administration of 100
     cc of Optiray for indication of multiple allergies.
     
     COMPARISONS:  [**3-12**] CT chest.
     
     CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: Compared to the prior exam, there has been interval
     decrease in the size of the right upper lobe consolidation, currently
     measuring 3 x 1.2 cm  (previously 4.0 x 3.6 cm).  In addition, the background
     of ground glass attenuation throughout both upper and lower lobes bilaterally
     has slightly decreased in the interval. The overall appearance of ground glass
     attenuation suggesting pulmonary edema is now improved.  The reticulo-nodular
     interstitial pattern also remains, but is significantly decreased in
     conspicuity, indicating a process in resolution. No new consolidations or
     pathologic processes are identified.  There is no pleural effusion.
     
     Soft tissue windows again demonstrate central venous stents.  The previously
     described filling defect in the left atrium is no longer identified. The heart
     appears normal. There is no significant lymphadenopathy. There is no
     pericardial effusion. A small 6 mm nodule in the subcutaneous tissues of the
     medial right breast is unchanged in the interval. The clinical significance of
     this finding is unknown.
     
     Extremely limited views of the upper abdomen again demonstrates
     hepatosplenomegaly.  An IVC line terminates at the IVC atrial junction.
     
     Bone windows reveal no suspicious osseous abnormalities.
     
     IMPRESSION:   Overall improvement in pattern of right upper lobe pulmonary
     consolidation, diffuse ground glass attenuation and diffuse reticular nodular
     opacities. Although each of these characteristics remain visible, the severity
     of these findings is significantly decreased compared to the [**3-12**] exam. The
     resolution of the right upper lobe consolidation may indicate the possibility
     that this was a septic embolus. If the patient has received appropriate
                                                                 (Over)

     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous serial axial images were obtained through the lungs at
     5 mm collimation.  Reconstructions were performed at 5 mm intervals.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There are small axillary lymph nodes that do
     not meet CT requirement for pathologic enlargement.  There are multiple small
     mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, not significantly changed compared to prior
     study.  There is slightly prominent residual thymic tissue.  Patient is status

     multifocal areas of ill defined opacity within the anterior left upper lobe
     and right upper lobe.  The diffuse ground-glass opacity and thickening of the
     septal lines has increased compared to prior study.  There has been interval
     increase in the innumerable tiny diffuse micronodular densities.  There is no
     pleural effusion.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Thrombosed right internal jugular vein with
need for total parenteral alimentation for internal jugular
vein thrombolysis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 25 year old
female with a complex past medical history with short gut
syndrome requiring chronic venous access for total parenteral
alimentation and subsequent numerous line infections.  The
patient had a temprary left femoral line placed in early March
through
which she gets intravenous fluids and total
parenteral nutrition. She had cleared an infection and had
negatove cultures after antibiotic therapy.  The decision was
made to change to a
right internal jugular line and discontinue the patient's old
left femoral line secondary to increased risk of infection.
In the past the patient has had numerous line infections with
[**Female First Name (un) **] Serratia, Klebsiella and Staphylococcus epidermidis,
and it was thought that keeping a left femoral line in place
would increase the risk of infection greatly.  Over the last
few days the patient admits to increased fatigue and
somnolence and lowgrade temperatures, but denies high fevers,
rigors, purulence, erythema, or tenderness to the left
femoral site.  The patient was taken by Interventional
Radiology this morning to get a right internal jugular line
placed but it was noted that the internal jugular vein was
occluded.  Interventional Radiology performed a high right
internal jugular stick and started TPA infusion with the hope of
lysing the thrombus and a
re-attempt of placing a working right internal jugular on
[**3095-4-10**] and subsequent removal of the patient's
indwelling left femoral line.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Gastrointestinal dysmotility
beginning at age 13, diagnosed with gastrointestinal motility
study, status post colectomy status post secondary to
gastrointestinal vasculitis which has resulted in short cut
syndrome and the need for chronic total parenteral nutrition.
2.  Status post gastrostomy tube, placed for gastric
decompression.  3.  Bladder atony with chronic suprapubic
catheter.  4.  The patient is wheelchair bound secondary to
neuropathic vasculitis.  5.  Chronic pain syndrome in the
lower half of the body maintained on chronic Dilaudid PCA at
home with large doses of Benadryl.  6.  Recurrent line
infections, [**Female First Name (un) **] Serratia, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus
epidermidis on the past secondary to line infections.  7.
Chronic venous access managed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 8946**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at
Interventional Radiology, status post multiple central line
placements and status post numerous recannulation attempts,
most recent the patient had a femoral line placed on [**3095-3-5**].  9.  Anemia of chronic disease.  10.  Eosinophilia and
leukopenia.  11.  Status post cholecystectomy.  12.  Left
salpingo-oophorectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  1.  Dilaudid PCA 4 mg/hr basal with
1.5 mg bolus q. 15 minutes, maximum 15 mg q. hour; 2.
Famotidine 40 mg b.i.d; 3.  Reglan 10 mg intravenously q. 12
hours; 4.  Zofran 10 mg intravenously five times a day; 5.
Benadryl 100 mg q. 3 hours prn, not to exceed 600 mg daily;
6.  Ativan 3 mg intravenous push q. 4 hours; 7.  Vitamin K 10
mg q. Monday; 8.  Multivitamins; 9.  Lovenox 60 mg
subcutaneously b.i.d.; 10. Estraderm patch 0.1 mg Monday and
Thursday; 11. Epogen 5000 units subcutaneously Tuesday and
Thursday; 13.  Paxil suppositories 10 mg per rectum t.i.d.;
14.  Neosporin irrigation 650 cc, suprapubic catheter.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with parents and receives
nursing home services.

ALLERGIES:  Cephalosporin, Scalpicin, Penicillin, unknown
reaction.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation - Vital signs 91/48,
heartrate 119, respirations 13, oxygen saturation 100%.
Neurological examination, alert and oriented times three.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, mucous
membranes moist, right internal jugular line in place.
Cardiac examination, tachycardiac, rate normal, no murmurs,
rubs or gallops appreciated.  Lungs, clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen, positive bowel sounds, soft,
nontender, nondistended.  No rebound or guarding.  Suprapubic
catheter in place.  Extremities, left femoral line in place,
no purulence, erythema or tenderness with palpation.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory studies upon admission, revealed
white blood cell count 3.6, hematocrit 30.2, platelets 136,
PT 13.8, PTT 40.6, INR 1.2, fibrinogen 322, sodium 139,
potassium 3.6, chloride 105, bicarbonate 25, BUN 7,
creatinine 0.5, glucose 97, calcium 8.7, phosphorus 4.6,
magnesium 1.7.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit Service for tpa (tissue plasminogen
activator infusion) therapy in the hopes that the patient's right
internal
jugular line could be passed once the thrombus in the
internal jugular vein could be lysed.  The patient's
fibrinogen levels, INR and platelets were monitored very
closely over the next day.  The morning of [**4-10**], the
patient was taken to Interventional Radiology where they
found that the thrombus was only minimally lysed and it was
decided to give the patient a further day of total parenteral
alimentation.  The patient remained stable on the floor and
had further infusion of total parenteral alimentation with no
laboratory abnormalities.  On [**4-11**], the patient was taken
to Interventional Radiology once again.  It was noted that
the total parenteral alimentation port was cracked in her
femoral line.  The left femoral line was changed over a wire
without difficulty.  Upon inspection of the right internal
jugular vein it was noticed that the internal jugular vein
was still occluded and was completely collapsed and there
would be no hope of placing a functional right internal
jugular line in the patient at this time.  The internal
jugular line was pulled at that time.  Pressure was applied
and the patient was sent back to Intensive Care Unit.  The
plan at that time was to bring the patient back in two to
three weeks at which time they would try once again to obtain
more stable and a cleaner site for central venous access for
the patient's total parenteral nutrition and numerous
intravenous medications.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  No change from admission.

DISCHARGE PLAN:
1.  The patient was to follow up with her primary care
physician in one to two weeks.
2.  The patient would be contacted by Interventional
Radiology in two to three weeks for reattempt at placement of
another central line.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY: 25 year old female with history of short gut syndrome and
     TPN dependency with poor IV access. The study was initially planned to be a
     tunneled right IJ central venous catheter.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 127**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2500**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 131**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 126**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 126**] being the attending
     radiologist who was present throughout the entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE: The benefits and risks of the procedure were explained to the
     patient and signed written consent was obtained. The patient's right neck was
     prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and the anesthesiologist
     provided sedation throughout the procedure. Given the patient's known history
     of poor IV access, ultrasound guidance was used to identify the right internal
     jugular vein. The limited ultrasound revealed a thickened and irregular wall
     of the internal jugular vein above a patent superior vena cava stent. On
     ultrasound, the stent was found to be patent. A transverse cervical collateral
     was noted. A micropuncture set was used to access the high right internal
     jugular vein under ultrasound visualization very high in the neck above at the
     level of this collateral where there was still patent lumen of the jugular
     vein. A .018 guidewire was placed through the 21 gauge needle and did not pass
     freely into the stented SVC. The 21 gauge needle was replaced for the 3 french
     inner dilator from the micropuncture set. The .018 guidewire was then replaced
     for an SV 8 wire which too did not pass into the SVC as seen under
     fluoroscopic visualization. The 3 french inner dilator was then removed and
     replaced with the 4.5 french dilator from the micropuncture set and this was
     used to place a .035 [**Doctor Last Name 133**] wire. Again, under fluoroscopic guidance, the [**Doctor Last Name 133**]
     wire could not be passed into the SVC due to obstructing clot. A 4 french
     sheath was then positioned using the [**Doctor Last Name 133**] guidewire and a 4 french Cobra with
     a superstiff glidewire was advanced under fluoroscopic guidance and this was
     successfully passed through the obstructing clot through the stented SVC into
     the right atrium.
     
     Contrast was injected and a venogram demonstrated a narrowed irregular mid to
     lower internal jugular vein which was normal in appearance above a
     transcervical collateral. Patency within the SVC stent was confirmed. The
     decision was made to hold off on placement of a tunneled central line as
     originally planned and instead to infuse TPN into the IVC in an attempt to
     dissolve clot and improve patency. A 40 cm 4 french MTI sidehole infusion
     catheter (sidehole length 5 cm) was placed over the guidewire after removal of
     the Cobra catheter with the sideholes positioned in the lower internal jugular
     vein. The guidewire was removed and the effusion catheter was afixed with a
     stat lock and multiple steri-strips and occlusive dressing. An infusion of TPA
                                                                 (Over)

     at a rate of 1 milligram per hour was begun and the patient was transferred to
     the ICU for further care. There are no immediate post procedural
     complications. Interval labs were ordered to followup on patient's
     coagulability status.
     
     IMPRESSION: Given the degree of narrowing and occlusion in the right internal
     jugular vein, the original plan to place a tunneled catheter in the internal
     jugular vein was abandoned and instead TPA infusion was begun in this region
     in hopes of improving patency of the right IJ. A followup venogram is planned
     for the following day.

     HISTORY:  Short gut syndrome.  Occluded right IJ.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 11508**] [**Doctor Last Name **] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1242**] [**Doctor Last Name 1243**] performed the procedure.  The
     attending physician is present and supervising the procedure throughout.
     
     PROCEDURE:  A right internal jugular venogram is performed with IV contrast
     through the existing right internal jugular catheter.  The right internal
     jugular catheter is removed and hemostasis is achieved with manual
     compression.
     
     A .018 glidewire is advanced through the existing left femoral line and the
     left femoral catheter is removed.  A 10 French peel-away sheath is advanced
     over the wire using fluoroscopic guidance.  A 10 French double lumen catheter
     is trimmed to the appropriate length and is advanced over the peel-away
     sheath using fluoroscopic guidance. The peel- away sheath is then removed. The
     distal tip of the catheter is confirmed by a single chest radiograph and the
     tip is in the IVC. The catheter is demonstrated to flush and withdraw. The
     line is secured to the skin with O- Proline suture.  The patient tolerated the
     procedure without immediate complication.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  1% local Lidocaine.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Right IJ venogram demonstrates nearly complete collapse of the right IJ
     and the right IJ catheter is removed.
     
     2)  Replacement of a double lumen 10 French central venous line over the wire,
     with the tip in the IVC.  The line is ready for use.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     to past infection she had removal of her right internal jugular catheter.
     Lysis of the occluded right internal jugular vein had been tried a week
     before.  The initial goal was to recannulate the IJ and place a stent for
     future access.
     
     PROCEDURE: The right chest wall and right neck were prepped in sterile
     fashion. The left groin region over the indwelling left transfemoral central
     line was also prepped in sterile fashion.  The procedure was performed under
     anesthesia. The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 126**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 126**]
     being present throughout.
     
     The left sided femoral line was pulled partially out of the skin.  It was cut.
     Over an Amplatz glidewire exchange was made for a 10 french, 40 cm bright
     tipped sheath.  Since the goal was to dilate the internal jugular vein with a
     cutting balloon an 8 french guiding catheter with a coaxially loaded
     headhunter catheter were advanced over the glidewire into the right
     brachiocephalic stent.  There was a firm occlusion at the upper end of the
     stent.  With the glidewire it was possible to gain entry into the markedly
     scarred right internal jugular vein.  A venogram of the jugular vein was
     performed.  It demonstrated that there was basically absent flow in this
     vessel which was entirely static.
     
     In the attempt to find another free piece of that vein ultrasound was used.

     ultrasonographic guidance.  An 0.018 guidewire entered through the stent.
     Since there was concern that it would not provide enough stiffness the
     decision was made to stiffen it with a snare.  From the left transfemoral
     access a 15 mm Amplatz snare was advanced into the right brachiocephalic
     stent.  In a foreign body retrieval maneuver the tip of the 0.018 guidewire
     was snared.  With this arrangement it was possible to advance a 4.5 french
     micropuncture system through the subclavian vein.  Then a 260 cm long exchange
     wire was advanced through the outer sheath part of the micropuncture set and
     was brought out in a through-and-through maneuver via the left groin.  The
     tract was then dilated first to 10 french and a 10 french peel-away sheath was
     placed.
     
     Preparations were made for tunnelling of the right chest wall.  At a site that
     the patient had located previously local anesthesia was placed for the exit
     site of the catheter.  An incision was made and a connection between the exit
     site and the subclavian puncture site was created after blunt dissection of
     the subclavian site and passage of a blunt [**Last Name (un) 56**] needle.  Over an 0.038
     guidewire a 10 french peel-away sheath was placed.  A double lumen [**Doctor Last Name 14414**]
     catheter was advanced through the tunnel and the cuff was placed in the mid
     level of the tunnel.  The catheter was then cut with fluoroscopic correlation
     so that its tip would end up in the cavoatrial junction.  Attempts to pass the
     tip of the catheter through the peel-away sheath failed since it kinked at the
     entry site into the stent.  Since also the dilator would not pass again, a 4
     french catheter with an 0.035 glidewire was used to gain access again into the
     brachiocephalic vein.  It was snared again with the Amplatz snare and brought
     out through the left femoral access.  Exchange was then made over the system
     for a 260 cm long exchange wire.  Then a 12 cm peel- away sheath was placed
     under the hope that leaving this guidewire for straightening it would be
     possible to advance the 10 french [**Doctor Last Name 14414**] next to it. This turned out to be
     possible.  The peel-away sheath was removed.  A good position was achieved
     with the tip at the cavoatrial junction and final adjustment was done under
     fluoroscopy.  The guidewire was removed.  The neck site was rinsed with
     hydrogen peroxide.  Closure over the subclavian site was performed with
     Dermabond.  The eixt site of the catheter was closed with a 20 Vicryl suture.
     The final chest radiograph was obtained.  It demonstrated the catheter in good
     location at the cavoatrial junction, ready for use. There was no pneumothorax.
     There are still some patchy infiltrates in the right lung that are known and
     are currently investigated medically.
     
     The femoral line was removed and hemostasis was achieved.  There were no
     immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION: Placement of a right subclavian line through the brachiocephalic
     stent with tip at the cavoatrial junction.  Completely static right internal

     to past infection she had removal of her right internal jugular catheter.
     Lysis of the occluded right internal jugular vein had been tried a week
     before.  The initial goal was to recannulate the IJ and place a stent for
     future access.
     
     PROCEDURE: The right chest wall and right neck were prepped in sterile
     fashion. The left groin region over the indwelling left transfemoral central
     line was also prepped in sterile fashion.  The procedure was performed under
     anesthesia. The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 126**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 126**]
     being present throughout.
     
     The left sided femoral line was pulled partially out of the skin.  It was cut.
     Over an Amplatz glidewire exchange was made for a 10 french, 40 cm bright
     tipped sheath.  Since the goal was to dilate the internal jugular vein with a
     cutting balloon an 8 french guiding catheter with a coaxially loaded
     headhunter catheter were advanced over the glidewire into the right
     brachiocephalic stent.  There was a firm occlusion at the upper end of the
     stent.  With the glidewire it was possible to gain entry into the markedly
     scarred right internal jugular vein.  A venogram of the jugular vein was
     performed.  It demonstrated that there was basically absent flow in this
     vessel which was entirely static.
     
     In the attempt to find another free piece of that vein ultrasound was used.
     With ultrasound it was possible to see the markedly thickened wall of the
     internal jugular vein.  There was a minimum amount of potential flow artifact

                                     FINAL REPORT
     to past infection she had removal of her right internal jugular catheter.
     Lysis of the occluded right internal jugular vein had been tried a week
     before.  The initial goal was to recannulate the IJ and place a stent for
     future access.
     
     PROCEDURE: The right chest wall and right neck were prepped in sterile
     fashion. The left groin region over the indwelling left transfemoral central
     line was also prepped in sterile fashion.  The procedure was performed under
     anesthesia. The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 126**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 126**]
     being present throughout.
     
     The left sided femoral line was pulled partially out of the skin.  It was cut.
     Over an Amplatz glidewire exchange was made for a 10 french, 40 cm bright
     tipped sheath.  Since the goal was to dilate the internal jugular vein with a
     cutting balloon an 8 french guiding catheter with a coaxially loaded
     headhunter catheter were advanced over the glidewire into the right
     brachiocephalic stent.  There was a firm occlusion at the upper end of the
     stent.  With the glidewire it was possible to gain entry into the markedly
     scarred right internal jugular vein.  A venogram of the jugular vein was
     performed.  It demonstrated that there was basically absent flow in this
     vessel which was entirely static.
     
     In the attempt to find another free piece of that vein ultrasound was used.
     With ultrasound it was possible to see the markedly thickened wall of the
     internal jugular vein.  There was a minimum amount of potential flow artifact
     in this vessel.  Under ultrasonographic guidance a 21 gauge needle was
     advanced into this vessel and an 0.018 guidewire was advanced.  This
     demonstrated however that it was basically meetings the area recanalized from
     inferior and that also from here no flow could be observed.  Since it was not
     possible to regain entry into a patent vessel a decision was made to advance
     in this access.
     
     During probing in the stent it became obvious there was still inflow from the
     right subclavian vein.  Therefore ultrasound was used and the right subclavian
     vein was identified.  It was entered with a micropuncture needle under
                                                                 (Over)

     ultrasonographic guidance.  An 0.018 guidewire entered through the stent.
     Since there was concern that it would not provide enough stiffness the
     decision was made to stiffen it with a snare.  From the left transfemoral
     access a 15 mm Amplatz snare was advanced into the right brachiocephalic
     stent.  In a foreign body retrieval maneuver the tip of the 0.018 guidewire
     was snared.  With this arrangement it was possible to advance a 4.5 french
     micropuncture system through the subclavian vein.  Then a 260 cm long exchange
     wire was advanced through the outer sheath part of the micropuncture set and
     was brought out in a through-and-through maneuver via the left groin.  The
     tract was then dilated first to 10 french and a 10 french peel-away sheath was
     placed.
     
     Preparations were made for tunnelling of the right chest wall.  At a site that
     the patient had located previously local anesthesia was placed for the exit
     site of the catheter.  An incision was made and a connection between the exit
     site and the subclavian puncture site was created after blunt dissection of
     the subclavian site and passage of a blunt [**Last Name (un) 56**] needle.  Over an 0.038
     guidewire a 10 french peel-away sheath was placed.  A double lumen [**Doctor Last Name 14414**]
     catheter was advanced through the tunnel and the cuff was placed in the mid
     level of the tunnel.  The catheter was then cut with fluoroscopic correlation
     so that its tip would end up in the cavoatrial junction.  Attempts to pass the
     tip of the catheter through the peel-away sheath failed since it kinked at the
     entry site into the stent.  Since also the dilator would not pass again, a 4
     french catheter with an 0.035 glidewire was used to gain access again into the
     brachiocephalic vein.  It was snared again with the Amplatz snare and brought
     out through the left femoral access.  Exchange was then made over the system
     for a 260 cm long exchange wire.  Then a 12 cm peel- away sheath was placed
     under the hope that leaving this guidewire for straightening it would be
     possible to advance the 10 french [**Doctor Last Name 14414**] next to it. This turned out to be
     possible.  The peel-away sheath was removed.  A good position was achieved
     with the tip at the cavoatrial junction and final adjustment was done under
     fluoroscopy.  The guidewire was removed.  The neck site was rinsed with
     hydrogen peroxide.  Closure over the subclavian site was performed with
     Dermabond.  The eixt site of the catheter was closed with a 20 Vicryl suture.
     The final chest radiograph was obtained.  It demonstrated the catheter in good
     location at the cavoatrial junction, ready for use. There was no pneumothorax.
     There are still some patchy infiltrates in the right lung that are known and
     are currently investigated medically.
     
     The femoral line was removed and hemostasis was achieved.  There were no
     immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION: Placement of a right subclavian line through the brachiocephalic
     stent with tip at the cavoatrial junction.  Completely static right internal
     jugular vein that was not amenable to recanalization (including maneuvers such
     as use of glidewires and even an 0.014 fine wire).
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     to past infection she had removal of her right internal jugular catheter.
     Lysis of the occluded right internal jugular vein had been tried a week
     before.  The initial goal was to recannulate the IJ and place a stent for
     future access.
     
     PROCEDURE: The right chest wall and right neck were prepped in sterile
     fashion. The left groin region over the indwelling left transfemoral central
     line was also prepped in sterile fashion.  The procedure was performed under
     anesthesia. The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 126**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 126**]
     being present throughout.
     
     The left sided femoral line was pulled partially out of the skin.  It was cut.
     Over an Amplatz glidewire exchange was made for a 10 french, 40 cm bright
     tipped sheath.  Since the goal was to dilate the internal jugular vein with a
     cutting balloon an 8 french guiding catheter with a coaxially loaded
     headhunter catheter were advanced over the glidewire into the right
     brachiocephalic stent.  There was a firm occlusion at the upper end of the
     stent.  With the glidewire it was possible to gain entry into the markedly
     scarred right internal jugular vein.  A venogram of the jugular vein was
     performed.  It demonstrated that there was basically absent flow in this
     vessel which was entirely static.
     
     In the attempt to find another free piece of that vein ultrasound was used.
     With ultrasound it was possible to see the markedly thickened wall of the
     internal jugular vein.  There was a minimum amount of potential flow artifact
     in this vessel.  Under ultrasonographic guidance a 21 gauge needle was
     advanced into this vessel and an 0.018 guidewire was advanced.  This
     demonstrated however that it was basically meetings the area recanalized from
     inferior and that also from here no flow could be observed.  Since it was not
     possible to regain entry into a patent vessel a decision was made to advance
     in this access.
     
     During probing in the stent it became obvious there was still inflow from the
     right subclavian vein.  Therefore ultrasound was used and the right subclavian
     vein was identified.  It was entered with a micropuncture needle under
                                                                 (Over)

     ultrasonographic guidance.  An 0.018 guidewire entered through the stent.
     Since there was concern that it would not provide enough stiffness the
     decision was made to stiffen it with a snare.  From the left transfemoral
     access a 15 mm Amplatz snare was advanced into the right brachiocephalic
     stent.  In a foreign body retrieval maneuver the tip of the 0.018 guidewire
     was snared.  With this arrangement it was possible to advance a 4.5 french
     micropuncture system through the subclavian vein.  Then a 260 cm long exchange
     wire was advanced through the outer sheath part of the micropuncture set and
     was brought out in a through-and-through maneuver via the left groin.  The
     tract was then dilated first to 10 french and a 10 french peel-away sheath was
     placed.
     
     Preparations were made for tunnelling of the right chest wall.  At a site that
     the patient had located previously local anesthesia was placed for the exit
     site of the catheter.  An incision was made and a connection between the exit
     site and the subclavian puncture site was created after blunt dissection of
     the subclavian site and passage of a blunt [**Last Name (un) 56**] needle.  Over an 0.038
     guidewire a 10 french peel-away sheath was placed.  A double lumen [**Doctor Last Name 14414**]
     catheter was advanced through the tunnel and the cuff was placed in the mid
     level of the tunnel.  The catheter was then cut with fluoroscopic correlation
     so that its tip would end up in the cavoatrial junction.  Attempts to pass the
     tip of the catheter through the peel-away sheath failed since it kinked at the
     entry site into the stent.  Since also the dilator would not pass again, a 4
     french catheter with an 0.035 glidewire was used to gain access again into the
     brachiocephalic vein.  It was snared again with the Amplatz snare and brought
     out through the left femoral access.  Exchange was then made over the system
     for a 260 cm long exchange wire.  Then a 12 cm peel- away sheath was placed
     under the hope that leaving this guidewire for straightening it would be
     possible to advance the 10 french [**Doctor Last Name 14414**] next to it. This turned out to be
     possible.  The peel-away sheath was removed.  A good position was achieved
     with the tip at the cavoatrial junction and final adjustment was done under
     fluoroscopy.  The guidewire was removed.  The neck site was rinsed with
     hydrogen peroxide.  Closure over the subclavian site was performed with
     Dermabond.  The eixt site of the catheter was closed with a 20 Vicryl suture.
     The final chest radiograph was obtained.  It demonstrated the catheter in good
     location at the cavoatrial junction, ready for use. There was no pneumothorax.
     There are still some patchy infiltrates in the right lung that are known and
     are currently investigated medically.
     
     The femoral line was removed and hemostasis was achieved.  There were no
     immediate complications.

     tract was then dilated first to 10 french and a 10 french peel-away sheath was
     placed.
     
     Preparations were made for tunnelling of the right chest wall.  At a site that
     the patient had located previously local anesthesia was placed for the exit
     site of the catheter.  An incision was made and a connection between the exit
     site and the subclavian puncture site was created after blunt dissection of
     the subclavian site and passage of a blunt [**Last Name (un) 56**] needle.  Over an 0.038
     guidewire a 10 french peel-away sheath was placed.  A double lumen [**Doctor Last Name 14414**]
     catheter was advanced through the tunnel and the cuff was placed in the mid
     level of the tunnel.  The catheter was then cut with fluoroscopic correlation
     so that its tip would end up in the cavoatrial junction.  Attempts to pass the
     tip of the catheter through the peel-away sheath failed since it kinked at the
     entry site into the stent.  Since also the dilator would not pass again, a 4
     french catheter with an 0.035 glidewire was used to gain access again into the
     brachiocephalic vein.  It was snared again with the Amplatz snare and brought
     out through the left femoral access.  Exchange was then made over the system
     for a 260 cm long exchange wire.  Then a 12 cm peel- away sheath was placed
     under the hope that leaving this guidewire for straightening it would be
     possible to advance the 10 french [**Doctor Last Name 14414**] next to it. This turned out to be
     possible.  The peel-away sheath was removed.  A good position was achieved
     with the tip at the cavoatrial junction and final adjustment was done under
     fluoroscopy.  The guidewire was removed.  The neck site was rinsed with
     hydrogen peroxide.  Closure over the subclavian site was performed with
     Dermabond.  The eixt site of the catheter was closed with a 20 Vicryl suture.
     The final chest radiograph was obtained.  It demonstrated the catheter in good
     location at the cavoatrial junction, ready for use. There was no pneumothorax.
     There are still some patchy infiltrates in the right lung that are known and
     are currently investigated medically.
     
     The femoral line was removed and hemostasis was achieved.  There were no
     immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION: Placement of a right subclavian line through the brachiocephalic
     stent with tip at the cavoatrial junction.  Completely static right internal
     jugular vein that was not amenable to recanalization (including maneuvers such
     as use of glidewires and even an 0.014 fine wire).

     to past infection she had removal of her right internal jugular catheter.
     Lysis of the occluded right internal jugular vein had been tried a week
     before.  The initial goal was to recannulate the IJ and place a stent for
     future access.
     
     PROCEDURE: The right chest wall and right neck were prepped in sterile
     fashion. The left groin region over the indwelling left transfemoral central
     line was also prepped in sterile fashion.  The procedure was performed under
     anesthesia. The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 126**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 126**]
     being present throughout.
     
     The left sided femoral line was pulled partially out of the skin.  It was cut.
     Over an Amplatz glidewire exchange was made for a 10 french, 40 cm bright
     tipped sheath.  Since the goal was to dilate the internal jugular vein with a
     cutting balloon an 8 french guiding catheter with a coaxially loaded
     headhunter catheter were advanced over the glidewire into the right
     brachiocephalic stent.  There was a firm occlusion at the upper end of the
     stent.  With the glidewire it was possible to gain entry into the markedly
     scarred right internal jugular vein.  A venogram of the jugular vein was
     performed.  It demonstrated that there was basically absent flow in this
     vessel which was entirely static.
     
     In the attempt to find another free piece of that vein ultrasound was used.
     With ultrasound it was possible to see the markedly thickened wall of the
     internal jugular vein.  There was a minimum amount of potential flow artifact
     in this vessel.  Under ultrasonographic guidance a 21 gauge needle was
     advanced into this vessel and an 0.018 guidewire was advanced.  This
     demonstrated however that it was basically meetings the area recanalized from
     inferior and that also from here no flow could be observed.  Since it was not
     possible to regain entry into a patent vessel a decision was made to advance
     in this access.
     
     During probing in the stent it became obvious there was still inflow from the
     right subclavian vein.  Therefore ultrasound was used and the right subclavian
     vein was identified.  It was entered with a micropuncture needle under
                                                                 (Over)

     ultrasonographic guidance.  An 0.018 guidewire entered through the stent.
     Since there was concern that it would not provide enough stiffness the
     decision was made to stiffen it with a snare.  From the left transfemoral
     access a 15 mm Amplatz snare was advanced into the right brachiocephalic
     stent.  In a foreign body retrieval maneuver the tip of the 0.018 guidewire

     ultrasonographic guidance.  An 0.018 guidewire entered through the stent.
     Since there was concern that it would not provide enough stiffness the
     decision was made to stiffen it with a snare.  From the left transfemoral
     access a 15 mm Amplatz snare was advanced into the right brachiocephalic
     stent.  In a foreign body retrieval maneuver the tip of the 0.018 guidewire
     was snared.  With this arrangement it was possible to advance a 4.5 french
     micropuncture system through the subclavian vein.  Then a 260 cm long exchange
     wire was advanced through the outer sheath part of the micropuncture set and
     was brought out in a through-and-through maneuver via the left groin.  The
     tract was then dilated first to 10 french and a 10 french peel-away sheath was
     placed.
     
     Preparations were made for tunnelling of the right chest wall.  At a site that
     the patient had located previously local anesthesia was placed for the exit
     site of the catheter.  An incision was made and a connection between the exit
     site and the subclavian puncture site was created after blunt dissection of
     the subclavian site and passage of a blunt [**Last Name (un) 56**] needle.  Over an 0.038
     guidewire a 10 french peel-away sheath was placed.  A double lumen [**Doctor Last Name 14414**]
     catheter was advanced through the tunnel and the cuff was placed in the mid
     level of the tunnel.  The catheter was then cut with fluoroscopic correlation
     so that its tip would end up in the cavoatrial junction.  Attempts to pass the
     tip of the catheter through the peel-away sheath failed since it kinked at the
     entry site into the stent.  Since also the dilator would not pass again, a 4
     french catheter with an 0.035 glidewire was used to gain access again into the
     brachiocephalic vein.  It was snared again with the Amplatz snare and brought
     out through the left femoral access.  Exchange was then made over the system
     for a 260 cm long exchange wire.  Then a 12 cm peel- away sheath was placed
     under the hope that leaving this guidewire for straightening it would be
     possible to advance the 10 french [**Doctor Last Name 14414**] next to it. This turned out to be
     possible.  The peel-away sheath was removed.  A good position was achieved
     with the tip at the cavoatrial junction and final adjustment was done under
     fluoroscopy.  The guidewire was removed.  The neck site was rinsed with
     hydrogen peroxide.  Closure over the subclavian site was performed with
     Dermabond.  The eixt site of the catheter was closed with a 20 Vicryl suture.
     The final chest radiograph was obtained.  It demonstrated the catheter in good
     location at the cavoatrial junction, ready for use. There was no pneumothorax.
     There are still some patchy infiltrates in the right lung that are known and
     are currently investigated medically.
     
     The femoral line was removed and hemostasis was achieved.  There were no
     immediate complications.

     to past infection she had removal of her right internal jugular catheter.
     Lysis of the occluded right internal jugular vein had been tried a week
     before.  The initial goal was to recannulate the IJ and place a stent for
     future access.
     
     PROCEDURE: The right chest wall and right neck were prepped in sterile
     fashion. The left groin region over the indwelling left transfemoral central
     line was also prepped in sterile fashion.  The procedure was performed under
     anesthesia. The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 126**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 126**]
     being present throughout.
     
     The left sided femoral line was pulled partially out of the skin.  It was cut.
     Over an Amplatz glidewire exchange was made for a 10 french, 40 cm bright
     tipped sheath.  Since the goal was to dilate the internal jugular vein with a
     cutting balloon an 8 french guiding catheter with a coaxially loaded
     headhunter catheter were advanced over the glidewire into the right
     brachiocephalic stent.  There was a firm occlusion at the upper end of the
     stent.  With the glidewire it was possible to gain entry into the markedly
     scarred right internal jugular vein.  A venogram of the jugular vein was
     performed.  It demonstrated that there was basically absent flow in this

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Line infection, purulent dranage from tunnel right subclavian
     central venous catheter, sepsis.
     
     MEDICATION AND CONTRAST:  General MAC anesthesia is provided by the
     anesthesiology department.  A total of 6 cc 1% subcutaneous lidocaine is
     administered to the right chest and right groin.  20 cc 60% nonionic contrast
     administered due to generalized debiliatation.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE:  Patient's mother is informed of the details and
     associated risks of the procedure and written consent was obtained.  The
     patient was place supine on an angiographic table and the right neck, chest
     wall, and groin were sterile prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The
     initial assessment of the tunneled right subclavian central venous catheter
     demonstrates erythema at the tunnel site and expressible purulent drainage.
     The proximal incision is opened following the administration of 1%
     subcutaneous Lidocaine and a moderate amount of purulent drainage is expressed
     from the site.  The site is bluntly dissected and aspirated and the
     subcutaneous tunnel is flushed with orthopedics antibiotic solution.  The cuff
     of the central venous catheter is bluntly dissected and the catheter withdrawn
     and hemostasis obtained.  The tip of the catheter is sent for culture.
     
     Ultrasonography demonstrates a patent and compressible right  common femoral
     vein.  Under ultrasonographic guidance the right common femoral vein is
     accessed using a 19 gauge single wall puncture needle under ultrasonographic
     observation.  Through this needle a O 35 inch [**Last Name (un) 193**] wire is advanced a short
     distance into the common femoral vein and a 3-French dilator is exchanged for
     the single wall puncture needle.  Next the O 35 inch [**Last Name (un) 193**] wire is exchanged
     for a angled O 35 [**Last Name (un) **] glidewire and the glidewire advanced into a large
     pelvic collateral vessel.  A 4-French sheath is then exchanged for the 3-
     French dilator and contrast administration demonstrates multiple large caliber
     collaterals with occluded common iliac vein as demonstrated on previous
     studies.  The O 35 inch angled glidewire is advanced into a large pelvic
     collateral vein and the 3-French sheath is exchanged for a 7-French triple
     lumen catheter.  The catheter is demonstrated to flush and aspirate well and
     is secured in place with 0 Prolene.  The tip of the catheter is within a large
     pelvic collateral vein, and is not in the central venous system due to the
     occlusion and multiple collateral veins.  There were no immediate
     complications and the patient tolerated the procedure well.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1. Removal of tunneled right subclavian central venous catheter,
     the tip was sent for culture and sensitivity.
                                                                 (Over)

                  2. Incision and drainage of fair amount of purulent material from
     the subcutaneous tunnel and subsequent flushing with orthopedic antibiotic
     solution.
                  3.  Again it is demonstrated at the right common femoral vein is
     patent and empties into large caliber pelvic collateral veins.  A 7-French
     triple lumen catheter is advanced with tip within a large caliber pelvic
     collateral vein, the tip is not within the central venous system, IVC.  These
     findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at the time of the study.

      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein
                                                                 (Over)

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now
                                                                 (Over)

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced
                                                                 (Over)

      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct

     Reconstruction of a pseudo-right common iliac vein through collaterals that
     were dilated and stented to 10 mm. Stenting of inrernal iliac vein and its
     collaterals to provide a pseudo-external iliac vein. Stenting and dilatation
     of the collateral intervening between this area and teh external iliac vein. A
     final venogram demonstrated patency of the segment. Because of some mild
     residual clot, an additional 5 mg TPA was given and Heparin infusion was
     started for the patient.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      26 year old woman with GI vasculitis, multiple line infections admitted with 
      Hickman line infection with MSSA. Hickman removed, afebrile, nl WBC count, neg 
      cx x 5 days.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      central line placement for TPN. Any line.                                       
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient has short gut syndrome and life-long TPN dependency. She
     had multiple prior occlusions of central vessels and their reconstruction.
      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein
                                                                 (Over)

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now
                                                                 (Over)

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced
                                                                 (Over)

     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now
                                                                 (Over)

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced
                                                                 (Over)

      26 year old woman with GI vasculitis, multiple line infections admitted with 
      Hickman line infection with MSSA. Hickman removed, afebrile, nl WBC count, neg 
      cx x 5 days.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      central line placement for TPN. Any line.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient has short gut syndrome and life-long TPN dependency. She
     had multiple prior occlusions of central vessels and their reconstruction.
      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein
                                                                 (Over)

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      26 year old woman with GI vasculitis, multiple line infections admitted with 
      Hickman line infection with MSSA. Hickman removed, afebrile, nl WBC count, neg 
      cx x 5 days.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      central line placement for TPN. Any line.                                       
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient has short gut syndrome and life-long TPN dependency. She
     had multiple prior occlusions of central vessels and their reconstruction.
      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein
                                                                 (Over)

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now
                                                                 (Over)

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced
                                                                 (Over)

     Reconstruction of a pseudo-right common iliac vein through collaterals that
     were dilated and stented to 10 mm. Stenting of inrernal iliac vein and its
     collaterals to provide a pseudo-external iliac vein. Stenting and dilatation
     of the collateral intervening between this area and teh external iliac vein. A
     final venogram demonstrated patency of the segment. Because of some mild
     residual clot, an additional 5 mg TPA was given and Heparin infusion was
     started for the patient.

     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced
                                                                 (Over)

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      26 year old woman with GI vasculitis, multiple line infections admitted with 
      Hickman line infection with MSSA. Hickman removed, afebrile, nl WBC count, neg 
      cx x 5 days.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      central line placement for TPN. Any line.                                       
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient has short gut syndrome and life-long TPN dependency. She
     had multiple prior occlusions of central vessels and their reconstruction.
      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein
                                                                 (Over)

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now
                                                                 (Over)

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later

      cx x 5 days.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      central line placement for TPN. Any line.                                       
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient has short gut syndrome and life-long TPN dependency. She
     had multiple prior occlusions of central vessels and their reconstruction.
      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein
                                                                 (Over)

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now
                                                                 (Over)

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced
                                                                 (Over)

     were dilated and stented to 10 mm. Stenting of inrernal iliac vein and its
     collaterals to provide a pseudo-external iliac vein. Stenting and dilatation
     of the collateral intervening between this area and teh external iliac vein. A
     final venogram demonstrated patency of the segment. Because of some mild
     residual clot, an additional 5 mg TPA was given and Heparin infusion was
     started for the patient.

     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further

     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was

     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      26 year old woman with GI vasculitis, multiple line infections admitted with 
      Hickman line infection with MSSA. Hickman removed, afebrile, nl WBC count, neg 
      cx x 5 days.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      central line placement for TPN. Any line.                                       
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient has short gut syndrome and life-long TPN dependency. She
     had multiple prior occlusions of central vessels and their reconstruction.
      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein
                                                                 (Over)

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now
                                                                 (Over)

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced
                                                                 (Over)

     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now
                                                                 (Over)

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced
                                                                 (Over)

      26 year old woman with GI vasculitis, multiple line infections admitted with 
      Hickman line infection with MSSA. Hickman removed, afebrile, nl WBC count, neg 
      cx x 5 days.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      central line placement for TPN. Any line.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient has short gut syndrome and life-long TPN dependency. She
     had multiple prior occlusions of central vessels and their reconstruction.
      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein
                                                                 (Over)

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      26 year old woman with GI vasculitis, multiple line infections admitted with 
      Hickman line infection with MSSA. Hickman removed, afebrile, nl WBC count, neg 
      cx x 5 days.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      central line placement for TPN. Any line.                                       
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient has short gut syndrome and life-long TPN dependency. She
     had multiple prior occlusions of central vessels and their reconstruction.
      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein
                                                                 (Over)

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now
                                                                 (Over)

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced
                                                                 (Over)

     of the collateral intervening between this area and teh external iliac vein. A
     final venogram demonstrated patency of the segment. Because of some mild
     residual clot, an additional 5 mg TPA was given and Heparin infusion was

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced
                                                                 (Over)

      26 year old woman with GI vasculitis, multiple line infections admitted with 
      Hickman line infection with MSSA. Hickman removed, afebrile, nl WBC count, neg 
      cx x 5 days.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      central line placement for TPN. Any line.                                       
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient has short gut syndrome and life-long TPN dependency. She
     had multiple prior occlusions of central vessels and their reconstruction.
      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein
                                                                 (Over)

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now
                                                                 (Over)

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      26 year old woman with GI vasculitis, multiple line infections admitted with 
      Hickman line infection with MSSA. Hickman removed, afebrile, nl WBC count, neg 
      cx x 5 days.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      central line placement for TPN. Any line.                                       
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient has short gut syndrome and life-long TPN dependency. She
     had multiple prior occlusions of central vessels and their reconstruction.
      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein
                                                                 (Over)

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now
                                                                 (Over)

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced
                                                                 (Over)

     Reconstruction of a pseudo-right common iliac vein through collaterals that
     were dilated and stented to 10 mm. Stenting of inrernal iliac vein and its
     collaterals to provide a pseudo-external iliac vein. Stenting and dilatation
     of the collateral intervening between this area and teh external iliac vein. A
     final venogram demonstrated patency of the segment. Because of some mild
     residual clot, an additional 5 mg TPA was given and Heparin infusion was
     started for the patient.

     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      26 year old woman with GI vasculitis, multiple line infections admitted with 
      Hickman line infection with MSSA. Hickman removed, afebrile, nl WBC count, neg 
      cx x 5 days.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      central line placement for TPN. Any line.                                       
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient has short gut syndrome and life-long TPN dependency. She
     had multiple prior occlusions of central vessels and their reconstruction.
      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein
                                                                 (Over)

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now
                                                                 (Over)

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the

     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now
                                                                 (Over)

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced
                                                                 (Over)

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      central line placement for TPN. Any line.

     HISTORY:  The patient has short gut syndrome and life-long TPN dependency. She
     had multiple prior occlusions of central vessels and their reconstruction.
      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein
                                                                 (Over)

     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the

     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.

     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      26 year old woman with GI vasculitis, multiple line infections admitted with 
      Hickman line infection with MSSA. Hickman removed, afebrile, nl WBC count, neg 
      cx x 5 days.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      central line placement for TPN. Any line.                                       
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient has short gut syndrome and life-long TPN dependency. She
     had multiple prior occlusions of central vessels and their reconstruction.
      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein
                                                                 (Over)

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now
                                                                 (Over)

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced
                                                                 (Over)

     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced
                                                                 (Over)

      26 year old woman with GI vasculitis, multiple line infections admitted with 
      Hickman line infection with MSSA. Hickman removed, afebrile, nl WBC count, neg 
      cx x 5 days.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      central line placement for TPN. Any line.                                       
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient has short gut syndrome and life-long TPN dependency. She
     had multiple prior occlusions of central vessels and their reconstruction.
      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein
                                                                 (Over)

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      26 year old woman with GI vasculitis, multiple line infections admitted with 
      Hickman line infection with MSSA. Hickman removed, afebrile, nl WBC count, neg 
      cx x 5 days.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      central line placement for TPN. Any line.                                       
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient has short gut syndrome and life-long TPN dependency. She
     had multiple prior occlusions of central vessels and their reconstruction.
      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein
                                                                 (Over)

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now
                                                                 (Over)

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced
                                                                 (Over)

     collaterals to provide a pseudo-external iliac vein. Stenting and dilatation
     of the collateral intervening between this area and teh external iliac vein. A
     final venogram demonstrated patency of the segment. Because of some mild
     residual clot, an additional 5 mg TPA was given and Heparin infusion was
     started for the patient.

     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced
                                                                 (Over)

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      26 year old woman with GI vasculitis, multiple line infections admitted with 
      Hickman line infection with MSSA. Hickman removed, afebrile, nl WBC count, neg 
      cx x 5 days.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      central line placement for TPN. Any line.                                       
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient has short gut syndrome and life-long TPN dependency. She
     had multiple prior occlusions of central vessels and their reconstruction.
      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein
                                                                 (Over)

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now
                                                                 (Over)

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was

     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region

     and would not point upward.

     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now
                                                                 (Over)

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced
                                                                 (Over)

     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      26 year old woman with GI vasculitis, multiple line infections admitted with 
      Hickman line infection with MSSA. Hickman removed, afebrile, nl WBC count, neg 
      cx x 5 days.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      central line placement for TPN. Any line.                                       
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient has short gut syndrome and life-long TPN dependency. She
     had multiple prior occlusions of central vessels and their reconstruction.
      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein
                                                                 (Over)

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now
                                                                 (Over)

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced
                                                                 (Over)

     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now
                                                                 (Over)

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced
                                                                 (Over)

      26 year old woman with GI vasculitis, multiple line infections admitted with 
      Hickman line infection with MSSA. Hickman removed, afebrile, nl WBC count, neg 
      cx x 5 days.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      central line placement for TPN. Any line.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient has short gut syndrome and life-long TPN dependency. She
     had multiple prior occlusions of central vessels and their reconstruction.
      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein
                                                                 (Over)

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      26 year old woman with GI vasculitis, multiple line infections admitted with 
      Hickman line infection with MSSA. Hickman removed, afebrile, nl WBC count, neg 
      cx x 5 days.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      central line placement for TPN. Any line.                                       
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient has short gut syndrome and life-long TPN dependency. She
     had multiple prior occlusions of central vessels and their reconstruction.
      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein
                                                                 (Over)

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now
                                                                 (Over)

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced
                                                                 (Over)

     Reconstruction of a pseudo-right common iliac vein through collaterals that
     were dilated and stented to 10 mm. Stenting of inrernal iliac vein and its
     collaterals to provide a pseudo-external iliac vein. Stenting and dilatation
     of the collateral intervening between this area and teh external iliac vein. A
     final venogram demonstrated patency of the segment. Because of some mild
     residual clot, an additional 5 mg TPA was given and Heparin infusion was
     started for the patient.

     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced
                                                                 (Over)

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      26 year old woman with GI vasculitis, multiple line infections admitted with 
      Hickman line infection with MSSA. Hickman removed, afebrile, nl WBC count, neg 
      cx x 5 days.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      central line placement for TPN. Any line.                                       
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient has short gut syndrome and life-long TPN dependency. She
     had multiple prior occlusions of central vessels and their reconstruction.
      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein
                                                                 (Over)

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now
                                                                 (Over)

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later

      cx x 5 days.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      central line placement for TPN. Any line.                                       
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient has short gut syndrome and life-long TPN dependency. She
     had multiple prior occlusions of central vessels and their reconstruction.
      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein
                                                                 (Over)

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now
                                                                 (Over)

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced
                                                                 (Over)

     were dilated and stented to 10 mm. Stenting of inrernal iliac vein and its
     collaterals to provide a pseudo-external iliac vein. Stenting and dilatation
     of the collateral intervening between this area and teh external iliac vein. A
     final venogram demonstrated patency of the segment. Because of some mild
     residual clot, an additional 5 mg TPA was given and Heparin infusion was
     started for the patient.

     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further

     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was

     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      26 year old woman with GI vasculitis, multiple line infections admitted with 
      Hickman line infection with MSSA. Hickman removed, afebrile, nl WBC count, neg 
      cx x 5 days.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      central line placement for TPN. Any line.                                       
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient has short gut syndrome and life-long TPN dependency. She
     had multiple prior occlusions of central vessels and their reconstruction.
      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein
                                                                 (Over)

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now
                                                                 (Over)

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced
                                                                 (Over)

     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now
                                                                 (Over)

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced
                                                                 (Over)

      26 year old woman with GI vasculitis, multiple line infections admitted with 
      Hickman line infection with MSSA. Hickman removed, afebrile, nl WBC count, neg 
      cx x 5 days.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      central line placement for TPN. Any line.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient has short gut syndrome and life-long TPN dependency. She
     had multiple prior occlusions of central vessels and their reconstruction.
      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein
                                                                 (Over)

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      26 year old woman with GI vasculitis, multiple line infections admitted with 
      Hickman line infection with MSSA. Hickman removed, afebrile, nl WBC count, neg 
      cx x 5 days.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      central line placement for TPN. Any line.                                       
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient has short gut syndrome and life-long TPN dependency. She
     had multiple prior occlusions of central vessels and their reconstruction.
      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein
                                                                 (Over)

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now
                                                                 (Over)

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced
                                                                 (Over)

     of the collateral intervening between this area and teh external iliac vein. A
     final venogram demonstrated patency of the segment. Because of some mild
     residual clot, an additional 5 mg TPA was given and Heparin infusion was

     projecting into the left iliac stent, using a combination of a 4 French and a
     5 French glide catheter, a stiff glide wire, a soft glide wire, a Roadrunner
     guide wire, a Sos catheter. It was possible to gain entry into the space
     around the stent in the left common iliac vein; however, the connection
     between the upper extent of the left-sided iliac stent abutting the right
     caval wall was too firm to be traversed. Therefore, the decision was made to
     stent into the left- sided 14-mm stent with the initial attempt to then later
     extend another stent from this location into the IVC, while at the same time a
     parallel stent would be placed from the left iliac system to provide catheter
     advancement from both sides. For this purpose a 40 mm stent was placed.
     
     A repeat venogram demonstrated greater inflow into the IVC; however, there was
     still a kink with tortuosity at the lower pelvic level, from which the
     catheter was inserted.  Therefore, it became necessary to extend this area
     with another 10 x 60 mm stent in an overlapping fashion.  Even after that it
     was not possible to advance the 12 French sheath, which in the meantime had
     started to kink somewhat.  An additional stent extension was therefore
     performed around the curvature of the collateral that initially connected to
     the femoral vein on the right side.  An angioplasty to 10 mm of the entire
     region was performed.  Since there was still concern for potential bleeding, a
     10 mm x 80 mm balloon was used, that then could be possibly taken for
     tamponade.  This improved the lumen; however, there was residual stenosis at
     the upper pseudo- common iliac vein.  Therefore, dilatation with a 10 x 2 mm
     balloon was performed.  After all the stents were placed, adaptation of lumen
     to the inflow in the pelvis became necessary, which was performed with a 12-mm
     balloon.
     
     Now efforts were directed towards bringing the right-sided stent component,
     which poked mildly into the left-sided 14-mm stent toward superiorly. Multiple
     attempts were made to direct it firmly upward; however, even when this was
     achieved, there was not enough stiffness to lead this stent segment clearly
     cranially.  At this time we did not desire to place a jugular approach to
     facilitate this.  A subsequent attempt was then made by pushing the stent end
     superiorly and therefore provide enough stiffness for equipment to advance
     superiorly if the inferior direction was blocked.  For this purpose, a balloon
     occlusion balloon was fully inflated and moved up within the stented region
     from the left femoral vein. However, the stent would slip off from the balloon
     and would not point upward.
      This, however, also gave a good indication that even large-bore equipment
     could be moved past the stent and at this point it may seem wiser not to
     extend the stent further cranially and end up with kissing stents within the
     already present 14-mm stent.
     
     The right-sided sheath was exchanged over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] guide wire for an 8 French
     sheath.  This sheath now ended relatively easily to the stented region.  It
     was connected to a side arm.  A double-lumen PICC line was then advanced
                                                                 (Over)

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      26 year old woman with GI vasculitis, multiple line infections admitted with 
      Hickman line infection with MSSA. Hickman removed, afebrile, nl WBC count, neg 
      cx x 5 days.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      central line placement for TPN. Any line.                                       
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient has short gut syndrome and life-long TPN dependency. She
     had multiple prior occlusions of central vessels and their reconstruction.
      Most recently a right femoral line was placed with the tip in a large pelvic
     collateral to provide transient access until another tunneled line can be
     placed.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Through the indwelling right quadruple-lumen catheter a venogram
     of the pelvis was performed.  It demonstrated that the vessel in which the
     catheter was indwelling was now very small, and at its tip was a large
     globular thrombus, which impaired the inflow into the main internal iliac vein
                                                                 (Over)

     segment that provides outflow from the right lower extremity.  The decision
     was therefore made to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.  Since the catheter
     would only accept an 018 guide wire, such was inserted, the line was removed
     and a micropuncture 4.5 French sheath set was advanced.  After removal of the
     inner dilator, a repeat injection was performed and TPA lysis was initiated
     with an infusion of 5 mg TPA.  After this infusion, the decision was made to
     proceed with mechanical maceration of the residual clot.  A glide wire was
     advanced, which found with entry into the right internal iliac vein.  Over
     some additional collaterals it was then possible to gain access into the left-
     sided common iliac vein stent.  Since a long time we had not been able to gain
     recanalization of the right lower extremity , therefore the decision was made
     to proceed.  With anesthesia in the room the patient was now fully intubated.
     Blood was typed and crossed and brought to the room.  Over the glide wire a 12
     French sheath was placed after intermittent facial dilatation.
      The large upsizing was necessary to be able to place a stent graft in case
     dilatation of the collaterals resulted in catastrophic rupture.
     
     The glide wire in the left common iliac vein still would not permit further
     advancement of the dilators or the sheath from the right groin, a foreign body
     retrieval maneuver to provide a through-and-through access became necessary.
     
     The left groin was prepped in sterile fashion.  The left femoral vein was
     punctured with a 19-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] guide wire an 8 French
     sheath was placed.  A 15-mm Amplatz snare was advanced, with which the glide
     wire was captured, and it was brought out the left femoral vein.  Having now a
     through-and-through access permitted some further advancement of the 12 French
     sheath.  Subsequently, angioplasty was performed with a small vessel balloon.
     To be able to place an 018 guide wire, which in case of need for placement of
     a coated stent, also would need to be less than 035, a glide catheter was used
     to be advanced over the 035 through-and-through wire.  After that a 300 cm SVA
     guide wire was placed.  Over this guide wire balloon angioplasty of the
     recanalized left iliac region was performed from centrally towards distally
     with a 6 mm balloon.  A venogram with injection at the upper-most extent of
     the recanalized region showed that there was now good flow into the IVC next
     to the inflow defect through the stent from the left lower extremity, from
     which unopacified blood was flowing into the IVC.  After this initial
     dilatation, the decision was made to place a stent so that if there should be
     catastrophic bleeding, placement of a wall graft could be performed.  A 10 mm
     x 80 mm Cordis Smartstent was placed from the recanalized right pseudo-common
     iliac vein.  Then, a second stent of the same size was placed in an
     overlapping fashion to lead further into the right-sided internal iliac vein.
     A repeat venogram was performed, which demonstrated some patency through this
     area without extravasation.  The ultimate goal was still to provide direct
     connection into the IVC, and the goal would have been to provide a parallel
     system to the stent that was indwelling from the left side.  Multiple
     maneuvers were attempted to pass by the upper exent of the  stent now
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Short-gut syndrome, recanalization of iliac veins and stenting on
     [**3095-5-22**].
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 192**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 2500**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 126**], the Attending Radiologist,
     who was present and supervising the entire procedure.
     
     MEDICATION AND CONTRAST: MAC was provided by the anesthesiology department.  A
     total of 5 cc 1% subcutaneous lidocaine was administered.  A total of 140 cc
     nonionc contrast were administered due to patient's generalized debilitation.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE:  Informed consent was obtained from patient's mother. The
     patient was placed supine on the angiographic table and bilateral groins and
     right neck were sterile prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Through the
     previously placed right sided common femoral vein 6 french sheath an initial
     venogram was obtained and demonstrated rapid flow through the patent
     reconstructed right iliac vein with rapid flow into the inferior vena cava and
     into multiple pelvic venous collaterals.  Previously placed stents are
     demonstrated to be widely patent and no filling defects suggestive of thrombus
     were demonstrated. There was however a stenosis in the right external iliac
     vein/ femoral vein peripheral to the stent. The decision was made to
     angioplasty and stent this area. Because of the close proximity to the entry
     site an access from contralateral became necessary.
     
     The location of the proximal entry site of the right sided common femoral vein
     sheath was determied and it was decided that the approach be made from the
     contralateral, left, common femoral vein previously placed sheath.  The
     previously placed PICC line is removed.  Through the left common femoral vein
     8 french sheath [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] wire and C2 Cobra catheter were advanced through the
     stented left common iliac vein crossing the bifurcation and entering the right
     reconstructed stented iliac vein.  The catheter and guidewire were then
     advanced to the level of the right common femoral vein.  The catheter was then
     exchanged for a 10 mm balloon over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] wire and the proximal stented
     common femoral vein is dilated again.  The right common femoral vein sheath is
     then removed and hemostasis was obtained.
                                                                 (Over)

     A 12 mm x 80 mm self expandable stent is then deployed under fluoroscopic
     observation spanning from the stented right reconstructed external iliac vein
     to the right common femoral vein, just proximal to the superficial femoral
     vein.  This stent is then dilated with a 10 mm balloon.  Subsequent venogram
     through the deflated ballon which was advancd into the superficial femoral
     vein demonstrates a widely patent stented iliac veins with good flow of
     contrast into a widely patent superficial femoral vein.  The balloon catheter
     is then withdrawn.
     
     Under ultrasonographic and fluoroscopic observation the stented superior vena
     cava is then entered using a 21 gauge micropuncture needle via the right neck.
     1% subcutaneous lidocaine was administerd prior to the access.  An 0.018
     guidewire was then advanced into the stented superior vena cava and the
     puncture needle exchanged for a 4.5 french sheath and then exchanged over a
     [**Doctor Last Name 133**] 6 and 8 mm dilators under fluoroscopic observation.  The dilator was
     then exchanged for an 8 french triple lumen central venous catheter with tip
     demonstrated to be within the right atrium.  The catheter is demonstrated to
     flush and aspirate well and is secured with 0 Prolene.  Post procedure chest
     fluoroscopy demonstrates the tip of the catheter to be within the right atrium
     and no pneumothorax is demonstrated.
     
     The left common femoral vein catheter is then withdrawn and hemostasis is
     obtained.  There were no immediate complications and the patient tolerated the
     procedure well.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Extension of right iliac stent to a level just proximal to the right
     superficial femoral vein with a 12 mm x 80 mm Smart, self expandable stent
     with subsequent balloon dilatation to 10 mm.
     
     2) Good flow demonstrated within the reconstructed iliac vein and no filling
     defects suggestive of thrombus.
     
     3) Successful placement of right IJ triple lumen central venous catheter with
     tip in the right atrium.  The catheter is ready for use.

     [**3095-5-22**].
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 192**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 2500**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 126**], the Attending Radiologist,
     who was present and supervising the entire procedure.
     
     MEDICATION AND CONTRAST: MAC was provided by the anesthesiology department.  A
     total of 5 cc 1% subcutaneous lidocaine was administered.  A total of 140 cc
     nonionc contrast were administered due to patient's generalized debilitation.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE:  Informed consent was obtained from patient's mother. The
     patient was placed supine on the angiographic table and bilateral groins and
     right neck were sterile prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Through the
     previously placed right sided common femoral vein 6 french sheath an initial
     venogram was obtained and demonstrated rapid flow through the patent
     reconstructed right iliac vein with rapid flow into the inferior vena cava and
     into multiple pelvic venous collaterals.  Previously placed stents are
     demonstrated to be widely patent and no filling defects suggestive of thrombus
     were demonstrated. There was however a stenosis in the right external iliac
     vein/ femoral vein peripheral to the stent. The decision was made to
     angioplasty and stent this area. Because of the close proximity to the entry
     site an access from contralateral became necessary.
     
     The location of the proximal entry site of the right sided common femoral vein
     sheath was determied and it was decided that the approach be made from the
     contralateral, left, common femoral vein previously placed sheath.  The
     previously placed PICC line is removed.  Through the left common femoral vein
     8 french sheath [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] wire and C2 Cobra catheter were advanced through the
     stented left common iliac vein crossing the bifurcation and entering the right
     reconstructed stented iliac vein.  The catheter and guidewire were then
     advanced to the level of the right common femoral vein.  The catheter was then
     exchanged for a 10 mm balloon over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] wire and the proximal stented
     common femoral vein is dilated again.  The right common femoral vein sheath is
     then removed and hemostasis was obtained.
                                                                 (Over)

     A 12 mm x 80 mm self expandable stent is then deployed under fluoroscopic
     observation spanning from the stented right reconstructed external iliac vein
     to the right common femoral vein, just proximal to the superficial femoral
     vein.  This stent is then dilated with a 10 mm balloon.  Subsequent venogram
     through the deflated ballon which was advancd into the superficial femoral
     vein demonstrates a widely patent stented iliac veins with good flow of
     contrast into a widely patent superficial femoral vein.  The balloon catheter
     is then withdrawn.
     
     Under ultrasonographic and fluoroscopic observation the stented superior vena
     cava is then entered using a 21 gauge micropuncture needle via the right neck.
     1% subcutaneous lidocaine was administerd prior to the access.  An 0.018
     guidewire was then advanced into the stented superior vena cava and the
     puncture needle exchanged for a 4.5 french sheath and then exchanged over a
     [**Doctor Last Name 133**] 6 and 8 mm dilators under fluoroscopic observation.  The dilator was
     then exchanged for an 8 french triple lumen central venous catheter with tip
     demonstrated to be within the right atrium.  The catheter is demonstrated to
     flush and aspirate well and is secured with 0 Prolene.  Post procedure chest
     fluoroscopy demonstrates the tip of the catheter to be within the right atrium
     and no pneumothorax is demonstrated.
     
     The left common femoral vein catheter is then withdrawn and hemostasis is
     obtained.  There were no immediate complications and the patient tolerated the
     procedure well.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Extension of right iliac stent to a level just proximal to the right
     superficial femoral vein with a 12 mm x 80 mm Smart, self expandable stent
     with subsequent balloon dilatation to 10 mm.
     
     2) Good flow demonstrated within the reconstructed iliac vein and no filling
     defects suggestive of thrombus.
     
     3) Successful placement of right IJ triple lumen central venous catheter with
     tip in the right atrium.  The catheter is ready for use.

     A 12 mm x 80 mm self expandable stent is then deployed under fluoroscopic
     observation spanning from the stented right reconstructed external iliac vein
     to the right common femoral vein, just proximal to the superficial femoral
     vein.  This stent is then dilated with a 10 mm balloon.  Subsequent venogram
     through the deflated ballon which was advancd into the superficial femoral
     vein demonstrates a widely patent stented iliac veins with good flow of
     contrast into a widely patent superficial femoral vein.  The balloon catheter
     is then withdrawn.
     
     Under ultrasonographic and fluoroscopic observation the stented superior vena
     cava is then entered using a 21 gauge micropuncture needle via the right neck.
     1% subcutaneous lidocaine was administerd prior to the access.  An 0.018
     guidewire was then advanced into the stented superior vena cava and the
     puncture needle exchanged for a 4.5 french sheath and then exchanged over a
     [**Doctor Last Name 133**] 6 and 8 mm dilators under fluoroscopic observation.  The dilator was
     then exchanged for an 8 french triple lumen central venous catheter with tip
     demonstrated to be within the right atrium.  The catheter is demonstrated to
     flush and aspirate well and is secured with 0 Prolene.  Post procedure chest
     fluoroscopy demonstrates the tip of the catheter to be within the right atrium
     and no pneumothorax is demonstrated.
     
     The left common femoral vein catheter is then withdrawn and hemostasis is
     obtained.  There were no immediate complications and the patient tolerated the
     procedure well.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Extension of right iliac stent to a level just proximal to the right
     superficial femoral vein with a 12 mm x 80 mm Smart, self expandable stent
     with subsequent balloon dilatation to 10 mm.
     
     2) Good flow demonstrated within the reconstructed iliac vein and no filling
     defects suggestive of thrombus.
     
     3) Successful placement of right IJ triple lumen central venous catheter with
     tip in the right atrium.  The catheter is ready for use.

     INDICATION: Short-gut syndrome, recanalization of iliac veins and stenting on
     [**3095-5-22**].
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 192**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 2500**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 126**], the Attending Radiologist,
     who was present and supervising the entire procedure.
     
     MEDICATION AND CONTRAST: MAC was provided by the anesthesiology department.  A
     total of 5 cc 1% subcutaneous lidocaine was administered.  A total of 140 cc
     nonionc contrast were administered due to patient's generalized debilitation.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE:  Informed consent was obtained from patient's mother. The
     patient was placed supine on the angiographic table and bilateral groins and
     right neck were sterile prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Through the
     previously placed right sided common femoral vein 6 french sheath an initial
     venogram was obtained and demonstrated rapid flow through the patent
     reconstructed right iliac vein with rapid flow into the inferior vena cava and
     into multiple pelvic venous collaterals.  Previously placed stents are
     demonstrated to be widely patent and no filling defects suggestive of thrombus
     were demonstrated. There was however a stenosis in the right external iliac
     vein/ femoral vein peripheral to the stent. The decision was made to
     angioplasty and stent this area. Because of the close proximity to the entry
     site an access from contralateral became necessary.
     
     The location of the proximal entry site of the right sided common femoral vein
     sheath was determied and it was decided that the approach be made from the
     contralateral, left, common femoral vein previously placed sheath.  The
     previously placed PICC line is removed.  Through the left common femoral vein
     8 french sheath [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] wire and C2 Cobra catheter were advanced through the
     stented left common iliac vein crossing the bifurcation and entering the right
     reconstructed stented iliac vein.  The catheter and guidewire were then
     advanced to the level of the right common femoral vein.  The catheter was then
     exchanged for a 10 mm balloon over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] wire and the proximal stented
     common femoral vein is dilated again.  The right common femoral vein sheath is
     then removed and hemostasis was obtained.

     INDICATION: Short-gut syndrome, recanalization of iliac veins and stenting on
     [**3095-5-22**].
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 192**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 2500**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 126**], the Attending Radiologist,
     who was present and supervising the entire procedure.
     
     MEDICATION AND CONTRAST: MAC was provided by the anesthesiology department.  A
     total of 5 cc 1% subcutaneous lidocaine was administered.  A total of 140 cc
     nonionc contrast were administered due to patient's generalized debilitation.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE:  Informed consent was obtained from patient's mother. The
     patient was placed supine on the angiographic table and bilateral groins and
     right neck were sterile prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Through the
     previously placed right sided common femoral vein 6 french sheath an initial
     venogram was obtained and demonstrated rapid flow through the patent
     reconstructed right iliac vein with rapid flow into the inferior vena cava and
     into multiple pelvic venous collaterals.  Previously placed stents are
     demonstrated to be widely patent and no filling defects suggestive of thrombus
     were demonstrated. There was however a stenosis in the right external iliac
     vein/ femoral vein peripheral to the stent. The decision was made to
     angioplasty and stent this area. Because of the close proximity to the entry
     site an access from contralateral became necessary.
     
     The location of the proximal entry site of the right sided common femoral vein
     sheath was determied and it was decided that the approach be made from the
     contralateral, left, common femoral vein previously placed sheath.  The
     previously placed PICC line is removed.  Through the left common femoral vein
     8 french sheath [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] wire and C2 Cobra catheter were advanced through the
     stented left common iliac vein crossing the bifurcation and entering the right
     reconstructed stented iliac vein.  The catheter and guidewire were then
     advanced to the level of the right common femoral vein.  The catheter was then
     exchanged for a 10 mm balloon over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] wire and the proximal stented
     common femoral vein is dilated again.  The right common femoral vein sheath is
     then removed and hemostasis was obtained.
                                                                 (Over)

     A 12 mm x 80 mm self expandable stent is then deployed under fluoroscopic
     observation spanning from the stented right reconstructed external iliac vein
     to the right common femoral vein, just proximal to the superficial femoral
     vein.  This stent is then dilated with a 10 mm balloon.  Subsequent venogram
     through the deflated ballon which was advancd into the superficial femoral
     vein demonstrates a widely patent stented iliac veins with good flow of
     contrast into a widely patent superficial femoral vein.  The balloon catheter
     is then withdrawn.
     
     Under ultrasonographic and fluoroscopic observation the stented superior vena
     cava is then entered using a 21 gauge micropuncture needle via the right neck.
     1% subcutaneous lidocaine was administerd prior to the access.  An 0.018
     guidewire was then advanced into the stented superior vena cava and the
     puncture needle exchanged for a 4.5 french sheath and then exchanged over a
     [**Doctor Last Name 133**] 6 and 8 mm dilators under fluoroscopic observation.  The dilator was
     then exchanged for an 8 french triple lumen central venous catheter with tip
     demonstrated to be within the right atrium.  The catheter is demonstrated to
     flush and aspirate well and is secured with 0 Prolene.  Post procedure chest
     fluoroscopy demonstrates the tip of the catheter to be within the right atrium
     and no pneumothorax is demonstrated.
     
     The left common femoral vein catheter is then withdrawn and hemostasis is
     obtained.  There were no immediate complications and the patient tolerated the
     procedure well.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Short-gut syndrome, recanalization of iliac veins and stenting on
     [**3095-5-22**].
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 192**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 2500**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 126**], the Attending Radiologist,
     who was present and supervising the entire procedure.
     
     MEDICATION AND CONTRAST: MAC was provided by the anesthesiology department.  A
     total of 5 cc 1% subcutaneous lidocaine was administered.  A total of 140 cc
     nonionc contrast were administered due to patient's generalized debilitation.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE:  Informed consent was obtained from patient's mother. The
     patient was placed supine on the angiographic table and bilateral groins and
     right neck were sterile prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Through the
     previously placed right sided common femoral vein 6 french sheath an initial
     venogram was obtained and demonstrated rapid flow through the patent
     reconstructed right iliac vein with rapid flow into the inferior vena cava and
     into multiple pelvic venous collaterals.  Previously placed stents are
     demonstrated to be widely patent and no filling defects suggestive of thrombus
     were demonstrated. There was however a stenosis in the right external iliac
     vein/ femoral vein peripheral to the stent. The decision was made to
     angioplasty and stent this area. Because of the close proximity to the entry
     site an access from contralateral became necessary.
     
     The location of the proximal entry site of the right sided common femoral vein
     sheath was determied and it was decided that the approach be made from the
     contralateral, left, common femoral vein previously placed sheath.  The
     previously placed PICC line is removed.  Through the left common femoral vein
     8 french sheath [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] wire and C2 Cobra catheter were advanced through the
     stented left common iliac vein crossing the bifurcation and entering the right
     reconstructed stented iliac vein.  The catheter and guidewire were then
     advanced to the level of the right common femoral vein.  The catheter was then
     exchanged for a 10 mm balloon over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] wire and the proximal stented
     common femoral vein is dilated again.  The right common femoral vein sheath is
     then removed and hemostasis was obtained.
                                                                 (Over)

     A 12 mm x 80 mm self expandable stent is then deployed under fluoroscopic
     observation spanning from the stented right reconstructed external iliac vein
     to the right common femoral vein, just proximal to the superficial femoral
     vein.  This stent is then dilated with a 10 mm balloon.  Subsequent venogram
     through the deflated ballon which was advancd into the superficial femoral
     vein demonstrates a widely patent stented iliac veins with good flow of
     contrast into a widely patent superficial femoral vein.  The balloon catheter
     is then withdrawn.
     
     Under ultrasonographic and fluoroscopic observation the stented superior vena
     cava is then entered using a 21 gauge micropuncture needle via the right neck.
     1% subcutaneous lidocaine was administerd prior to the access.  An 0.018
     guidewire was then advanced into the stented superior vena cava and the
     puncture needle exchanged for a 4.5 french sheath and then exchanged over a
     [**Doctor Last Name 133**] 6 and 8 mm dilators under fluoroscopic observation.  The dilator was
     then exchanged for an 8 french triple lumen central venous catheter with tip
     demonstrated to be within the right atrium.  The catheter is demonstrated to
     flush and aspirate well and is secured with 0 Prolene.  Post procedure chest
     fluoroscopy demonstrates the tip of the catheter to be within the right atrium
     and no pneumothorax is demonstrated.
     
     The left common femoral vein catheter is then withdrawn and hemostasis is
     obtained.  There were no immediate complications and the patient tolerated the
     procedure well.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Extension of right iliac stent to a level just proximal to the right
     superficial femoral vein with a 12 mm x 80 mm Smart, self expandable stent
     with subsequent balloon dilatation to 10 mm.
     
     2) Good flow demonstrated within the reconstructed iliac vein and no filling
     defects suggestive of thrombus.
     
     3) Successful placement of right IJ triple lumen central venous catheter with
     tip in the right atrium.  The catheter is ready for use.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     
     
     This is a 26 year old female who has short bowel syndrome and is in need of
     paraenteral nutrition.  A short catheter had previously been placed in the
     right internal jugular vein with the tip lying in the distal SVC for IV
     medication.  Because there was a question of infection and the patient was not
     febrile, decision as made to place a long-term tunneled catheter.
     
     Informed consent was obtained.  The right internal jugular and infraclavicular
     area was prepped with Betadine and a drape placed.  The spot for the tunnel
     was selected and a small 5 mm incision was made in the skin.  The tissues were
     spread and a tunnel was made from the infraclavicular area to the skin site
     where the previous placed catheter was placed.  A guidewire was advanced
     through the tunnel and the tunnel dilated with a peel away sheath to 9 French.
     The 7 French dual lumen Hickman with a cuff was placed in satisfactory
     position and the tunnel jugular catheter eventually removed and replaced with
     a 9 French peel away sheath.  The guidewire and stilette was removed from the
     peel away sheath and the tunneled catheter was passed through the peel away
     into the right internal jugular vein.  The tip is in excellent position at the
     inferior edge of the previously placed superior vena cava stent at the orifice
     of the right internal jugular vein.  A chest film was taken to demonstrate th
     exact location.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Successful tunneling of a 7 French Hickman into the SVC.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      CHANGE RIGHT HICKMAN OVER WIRE FOR PRESUMED LINE SEPSIS                         
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  GI vasculitis.  Admitted with gram negative bacteremia.  Indwelling
     Hickman.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 2165**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1243**] with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 1243**] present and supervising throughout.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  General Anesthesia and local Lidocaine.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Written consent was obtained prior to beginning the procedure.
     Patient was placed supine on the angiographic table, and the right chest and
     neck were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  An 035 guide wire
     could not passed through the indwelling 7 French double-lumen Hickman
     catheter.  As such, an incision was made over the original puncture site and
     the hub of the catheter was excised.  The catheter was secured to the skin and
     the proximal portions of the catheter were threaded through the tunnel.  An
     018 guide wire was then advanced without difficulty through the remaining
     portion of the indwelling catheter. This was exchanged for a 4 French sheath
     over the wire.  An 035 guide wire was then advanced without difficulty into
     the IVC using fluoroscopic guidance.  The 4 French sheath was then exchanged
     for an 8 French Peel- Away sheath and a new 7 French double-lumen Hickman was
     advanced through the tunnel in the anterior chest wall on the right.  The wire
     and dilator were removed, and the double-lumen Hickman, trimmed to 46 cm, was
     advanced through the Peel- Away sheath using fluoroscopic guidance.  A chest
     film was obtained. The incision over the puncture site was closed with two 2-0
     Prolene sutures. A single 2-0 Prolene suture was placed next to the exit site
     of the catheter from the tunnel.
     
     FINDINGS:  The procedure was successful with the tip of the Hickman catheter
     projecting in the distal portion of the stented SVC.  Both ports flush easily
     and aspirate easily.
     
     The tip of the indwelling catheter was sent for culture.
     
     There were no immediate postprocedure complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful exchange of double-lumen 7 French Hickman tunneled
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     PHYSICIANS: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2598**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1243**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1243**] was present and supervising
     throughout the procedure.
     
     INDICATION: 26-year-old woman with history of short gut syndrome needing
     chronic TPN. Patient presents for exchange of right internal jugular tunneled
     central venous line.
     
     ANESTHESIA: MAC and local anesthesia.
     
     PROCEDURE: Signed and informed consent was obtained. The patient was brought
     to the angiography suite with the assistance of the anesthesia team and placed
     supine on the table. The right upper chest wall was prepped and draped in the
     usual sterile fashion. A .018 glidewire was advanced through the existing
     catheter and into the inferior vena cava. 2 cc of 1% lidocaine was used to
     anesthetize the skin overlying the tunneled catheter at the right internal
     jugular vein entrance site. A 1/2 cm incision was made with a scalpel and
     blunt dissection performed with a mosquito clamp. The catheter was exposed.
     The hub of the catheter was then cut off and the line was pulled through the
     tunnel. The catheter was then withdrawn over the guidewire. A 4 Fr sheath was
     then advanced over the wire and the wire was exchanged for a .035 [**Last Name (un) 193**]
     wire.  The sheath was exchanged for a 9 Fr peelaway sheath. The new double
     lumen 7 Fr catheter was cut to the same size as the previous catheter. The
     line was advanced through the tunnel in the right upper chest wall. The
     cannula and wire were then removed and the tip of the catheter was placed
     through the sheath and into the superior vena cava. The sheath was peeled
     away. The lines were flushed. A postprocedure chest x-ray confirmed the tip of
     the line to be in the superior vena cava, immediately above the right atrium.
     
     The right neck incision was closed using a single zero silk suture. A single
     zero silk suture was also used at the right upper chest wall exit site to
     secure the catheter. The lines were heplocked.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: No complications.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful exchange of right internal jugular 7 Fr double lumen
     central venous line, with tip at the superior vena cava immediately above the
     right atrium. The line is ready for use.

     staff radiologist present and supervising throughout the entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE:  Informed written consent was obtained.  The patient was
     placed supine on the angiography table with the right chest and catheter
     prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Patient was placed under
     General Anesthesia.  Good aspiration and flush was seen from both ports of the
     tunneled line.  The cuff was dissected from the subcutaneous tissues.  An 018
     wire was then advanced down the distal tip of the tunneled line. The line was
     removed, leaving the 018 wire in place.  A 4 French sheath was advanced over
     the wire.  This was a difficult exchange due to the lack of stiffness of the
     018 wire.  The 4 French dilator was removed.  An injection was performed
     through the angiographic sheath.  This demonstrated patency of the SVC.  There
     was also tenuous access to the right IJ vein, where the angiographic sheath
     was located.  An 018 wire was then attempted to pass through the angiographic
     sheath without success.  The catheter had obviously become dislodged during
     injection.  At this point pressure was held at the puncture point in the right
     IJ vein.  Ultrasound was performed to relocate the IJ vein.  Through an
     anesthetized skin approach and utilizing a micropuncture set, access was
     obtained into the right IJ vein. The micropuncture wire was advanced in the
     IVC.  The existing tunnel tract was used but cannulated with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 56**] needle
     and blunt tip, after removing the angiographic sheath.  The blunt tip was
     removed, and an Amplatz Super-stiff wire was passed through the [**Last Name (un) 56**]
     needle. The [**Last Name (un) 56**] needle was removed.  A 9 French tunneled sheath was placed
     over the Amplatz through the tunnel tract.  The inner dilator was removed, and
     the 7 French dual-lumen tunneled catheter was advanced through the Peel-Away
     sheath.  The Peel-Away sheath was removed but exchanged for the tunneled
     catheter.  The cuff was appropriately placed after sizing the tunneled
     catheter to 16 cm, tip to cuff.  Then, attention was refocused to the right IJ
     vein puncture.  Subsequent dilatation was performed over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] wire to place
     the 9 French Peel-Away sheath in the IJ vein.  The inner dilator was removed.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  26 y/o female with chronic vasculitis syndrome with question of
     new left upper lobe cavitary mass.
     
     COMMENTS: Enhanced CT scan of the chest was performed following the uneventful
     intravenous administration of 100 cc of Optiray.  Spiral CT scan was performed
     encompassing both lungs.
     
     Comparison is made to previous study [**3095-4-1**].
     
     Again noted is diffuse ground glass opacities consistent with patient's
     history of 'vasculitis and eosinophilia'. The differential diagnosis again
     include Churg-[**Last Name (un) **] syndrome, microscopic PN, [**Last Name (un) 129**]-occlusive diseas . There
     is evidence of biopsy in the right lower lobe.
     
     Note is made of new moderate sized left pleural effusion. In addition, there
     are multiple bilateral peripheral opacities identified.  The air seen in the
     recent chest X-ray is probably in the main PA, which has decreased in size
     since [**3095-11-20**], which was detected by chest X-ray.  There is evidence of
     tracheal bronchomalacia.  There is hepatosplenomegaly with heterogeneous
     enhancement of the liver in the earlier phase of the  CT scan.  There is air
     seen in the branching structure at the center portion of the liver, which
     is probably in the biliary system, less likely in the portal system.  With
     history of short gut syndrome, the possibility of ischemic bowel with portal
     vein air cannot be excluded.  Please also correlate any history of the
     cholecystectomy or papillotomy in this patient.
     
     Incidental note is made of malrotation of the right kidney.
     
     The air in the main pulmonary artery could be related to injection of contrast
     or patient's indwelling hickman catheter.  Small amount of air is also seen in
     the right atrium and right ventricle.  The above mentioned bilateral
     multifocal peripheral opacity could be due to pulmonary embolism or septic
     emboli.
     
     The patient has stents in both innominate veins and superior vena cava. The
     tip of the hickman catheter is identified in the superior vena cava.
     
     No apparent bony abnormalities are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Diffuse ground glass abnormality consistent with patient's history of
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION: Chronic vasculitic syndrome with new left upper lobe cavitary mass
     and with possible pulmonary embolus on prior study.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helical axial images of the chest were obtained without and with IV
     contrast. 100 cc Optiray contrast was administered. Nonionic contrast was used
     secondary to rapid bolus technique. Reformatted images were obtained in
     multiple planes.
     
     COMPARISON: [**3095-11-22**] chest CT.
     
     CHEST CT WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The images are slightly degraded
     secondary to motion artifact. The pulmonary vasculature is adequately
     visualized down to the main branches. No intraluminal filling defects are
     present. Bilateral small hilar lymph nodes are present. There is otherwise no
     significant mediastinal lymph node enlargement. Endovascular stents are again
     seen in the right and left brachiocephalic veins and inferior vena cava.
     
     Extensive bilateral ground glass opacities are present. There are also
     scattered small focal areas of consolidation in both lungs. The appearance of
     this has not significantly changed in the interval. A left pleural effusion is
     present which has decreased in size in the interval. A compression fracture is
     present at the T4 level. There is no spondylolisthesis or evidence of
     dislocation at this level.  No cavitary pulmonary lesions are seen.
     
     The osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     The trachea and bronchi are unchanged in appearance.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Reformatted images in multiple planes confirm the above
     mentioned findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism in the main pulmonary arterial branches.
     
     2. Diffuse ground glass opacities and scattered small areas of consolidation
     in both lungs, unchanged in the interval. These are consistent with patient's
     history of vasculitis.

     intravenous administration and oral administration of contrast.
     
     CONTRAST:  120 cc of intravenous Optiray.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is patchy
     atelectasis at both lung bases.  On the few limited images of the right
     posterior lung base there is a curvilinear high attenuation material
     suggestive of a prior wedge resection.  The liver, pancreas, spleen, adrenal
     glands and right kidney are unremarkable. Again incidentally noted is at least
     a high duplex left renal collecting system.  The kidney is otherwise
     unremarkable.  There is no free air or ascites.  Again noted is the
     gastrostomy tube.  There are no abnormally dilated loops of small bowel. There
     are scattered lymph nodes, which do not meet CT criteria for pathologic
     enlargement.
     
     CT PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The rectum, sigmoid colon
     and uterus are unremarkable.  There is a suprapubic catheter again noted
     within the bladder.  The distal IVC and left femoral vein stent is unchanged.
     There has been interval placement of a right femoral venous stent.  There is
     no free pelvic fluid or deep pelvic lymphadenopathy.
     
     The osseous structures are unremarkable.  There are multiple buttock granuloma
     bilaterally.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      26 year old woman with underlying GI motility pathology, has Hickman x12yr for 
      meds, TPN, in ED s/p Hickman falling out.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      placement of Hickaman                                                           
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  A 26-year-old woman with underlying GI abnormality, has Hickman
     catheter for TPN  since [**04**] years.  The patient is here today in emergency
     department status post Hickman catheter falling out.  The patient needs access
     for medications, TPN.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 321**], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1242**] [**Name (STitle) 1243**], the attending radiologist
     present and supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     ANESTHESIA/MEDICATIONS:  The procedure was performed under MAC anesthesia.
     Local with 1% Lidocaine.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was explained to the patient and informed
     consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the angiography suite and
     placed supine on the angiography table and MAC anesthesia was given by the
     anesthesiology service.  The left groin was prepped and draped in the usual
     sterile fashion.  Using  fluoroscopic guidance, the left common femoral vein
     was accessed using a 19-gauge single- wall puncture needle.  A .018 guide wire
     was then advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.  A
     left iliac stent was in place.  The needle was then exchanged for a micro-
     puncture sheath.  The inner dilator and .018 guide wire were then removed and
     a J-tipped wire was then advanced through the sheath into the inferior vena
     cava.  The sheath was removed and the tract was dilated with a 7-French
     dilator.  A 7-French dual-lumen Hickman catheter was then advanced over a
     Peel-Away sheath into the inferior vena cava.  Both ports were aspirated and
     flushed with ease. An x-ray obtained following placement documents the tip to
     be in the inferior vena cava.  The line was secured to the patient's skin
     using an 0-Prolene suture. An Op-Site was then placed over the catheter.  The
     line is ready for use.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of left femoral 7-French dual-lumen Hickman
     catheter via left common femoral vein, tip in the IVC. The line is ready for
     use.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: Short gut syndrome. The patients prior central line had ""fallen
     out"" earlier, and the  patient had a temporary left femoral line and was
     treated with antibiotics. She now needs other access for TPN fluids.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed with MAC Anesthesia .  The right neck
     and left groin were prepared in a sterile fashion.  Ultrasound was used to
     identify the right IJ vein.  As previously, the right IJ vein was occluded.
     The lower part of the right brachycephalic vein was patent and the struts of
     an indwelling stent were visible. After application of 3 ml of 1% Lidocaine,
     ultrasound was used to target the occluded segment of the IJ vein and
     fluoroscopy was then used to angle the needle further down into the stented
     region. It was possible to pass a .018 guide wire into the SVC.  The neck
     incision was enlarged. Then, a tunnel was created in the lateral right chest
     wall to an exit site that the patient beforehand indicated, which was about at
     the level of the nipples.  Local anesthesia was applied over the entire tract.
     An incision was made over the chest wall.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 56**] needle was made to tunnel
     pass through the very firm subcutaneous tissue and was brought out the jugular
     incision site.  A .035 guide wire was placed, followed by a 12 French Peel-
     away sheath.  Through this sheath, a double-lumen Hickman catheter was placed.
     Now, the neck site was dilated.  An Amplatz Super-stiff guide was advanced
     into the IVC.  Sequential dilatations were performed at 5, 7, 9, and 10
     French, then a 10 French Peel-away sheath was placed.  The internal length of
     the catheter was determined and superfluous catheter material was cut off.
     After placement of the 10 French sheath, the Hickman catheter was fed into the
     SVC.  The curve of the catheter material was buried in the tunnel after
     blunt dissection of a pocket over the right IJ incision site. Appropriate
     positioning was demonstrated on fluoroscopy.  The neck incision was closed
     with Dermabond.  The incision site at the lower neck was closed with 2-0
     Vicryl.  Then, a Steri-Strip was placed around the exit site of the catheter
     and sutured to the skin with 0-Prolene.  A winged Stat-lock mechanism was then
     brought to the adjacent segment of external catheter and this also was sutured
     to the skin.
     
     A final chest radiograph was obtained.  It demonstrated the tip of the
     catheter in the superior vena cava passing through the brachycephalic and SVC
     stents.  There was no pneumothorax.  As previously seen, there are some patchy
     infiltrates bilaterally.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a tunneled right IJ line.
                                                                 (Over)

     HISTORY:  26 year old woman with right IJ tunneled Hickman catheter for TPN
     access.  One of the ports of the catheter had been damaged.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  This procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1323**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1243**]
     who was present and supervising throughout.  After induction of general
     anesthesia, the patient's right neck and chest were prepped and draped in
     standard sterile fashion.  A 0.018 wire was advanced through the undamaged
     lumen into the IVC.  Next, lidocaine was infused at the right IJ puncture
     site.  A small incision was made with an 11-blade scalpel and the catheter was
     exposed with blunt dissection.  Proximal and distal control of the catheter
     was obtained with [**Doctor Last Name 2391**] clamps and the catheter was cut around the 0.018 wire.
      The intravascular portion of the Hickman catheter was then removed over the
     wire and exchanged for a 4-French catheter.  The tunneled portion of the
     Hickman was then removed and discarded.  A new 10-French Hickman catheter was
     attached to a tunneling device and after submerging in orthopedic solution the
     catheter was tunneled from the upper chest incision to the right IJ puncture
     site.  The 0.018 wire and dilator were removed from the 4-French catheter and
     [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] wire was advanced into the IVC.  The 4-French catheter was exchanged
     for a 10-French peel-away sheath.  The wire and dilator were subsequently
     removed.  The catheter was advanced and the peel-away sheath was removed.  The
     catheter tip was positioned at the distal superior vena cava.  The neck
     incision was closed with Dermabond and the line was secured with a StatLock
     and 3-0 Prolene sutures.  The catheter was then flushed and heplocked.  The
     patient was then extubated and transferred to the Recovery Room in stable
     condition.  There were no immediate post-procedure complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful exchange for new 10-French Hickman catheter via right
     IJ access with the tip in distal SVC using fluoroscopic guidance.  The line is
     ready for use.

     tunnel Hickman catheter for TPN access.  The cuff of the Hickman catheter was
     out of the exit site.  Patient is here today for catheter exchange.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 321**], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1242**] [**Name (STitle) 1243**], attending radiologist
     present and supervised throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  Informed written consent was obtained.  The procedure was
     performed with MAC anesthesia.  The right neck and upper chest wall were
     scrubbed and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Under fluoroscopic guidance
     it was noted that the Hickman catheter is completely out of the vein.
      Decision was made to place a new IJ tunnel Hickman catheter.  Ultrasound was
     used to identify the right IJ vein.  The right internal jugular vein was
     occluded and the lower part of the right brachiocephalic vein was patent stent
     visible.  Through anesthetized skin approach and ultrasonographic guidance
     access was gained into the occluded segment of the right internal jugular
     vein.  An 0.018 guidewire was then advanced through the needle into the
     superior vena cava.  The needle was then exchanged for a micropuncture set.
     The previously placed Hickman catheter was pulled out and the same tract was
     used for tunnelling the new Hickman catheter.  A new 10 french Hickman
     catheter was then attached to the tunneller after submerging in orthopedic
     solution the catheter was tunnelled from the upper chest incision to the right
     IJ puncture site.  The 0.018 guidewire and inner dilator of the micropuncture
     set were removed and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 133**] wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava.
     The micropuncture sheath was then exchanged for a 10 french peel-away sheath.
     The wide end dilator was subsequently removed and the catheter was advanced
     through the peel-away sheath.  The catheter tip was positioned in the superior
     vena cava. A final chest x-ray was obtained demonstrating the tip of the
     catheter in the distal superior vena cave.  Both ports of the catheter was
     aspirated and flushed.  The catheter was secured to the skin with 20 Prolene
     and 0 silk suture.  The neck incision was also sutured with 20 Prolene suture.
     A stat-lock was applied and the stat-lock was secured to the skin with the 20
     silk suture.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.
     
     ANESTHESIA/MEDICATIONS: MAC anesthesia was provided by the anesthesiology
     service.  No contrast was used.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of 10 french tunneled Hickman catheter via
     right IJ access, tip in distal superior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.
     The line is ready for use.
