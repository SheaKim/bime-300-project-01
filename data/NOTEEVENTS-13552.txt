Admission Date:  [**2974-6-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2974-6-28**]

Date of Birth:   [**2880-2-5**]       Sex:  F

Service:  ACOVE

ADDENDUM:
1. Neurology:  The patient was scheduled to go to [**Hospital3 2592**] facility on [**2974-6-22**] after being worked up for
failure to thrive.  However at 12 PM on [**2974-6-22**], the patient
was noted to have acute mental status changes.  She was
moaning, but was unable to speak.  The patient was not able
to follow any directions.  She was noted to have a
right-sided facial droop.  In addition, she was noted to have
right-sided hemiparesis.  On further neurological
examination, the patient was noted to have left-sided gaze
deviation.  The patient was immediately thought to be having
an acute stroke.  The stroke team was called.  A head CT was
obtained because the patient was not able to get a head MR
secondary to her pacer.  The official read of the head CT was
read as normal with no acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
However the stroke fellow commented on subtle signs of early
ischemia such as a loss of insular ribbon, some sulcal
effacement in the left temporal and frontal peri-insular
region.  He also noted a subtle left MCA sign.  Because of
these acute changes in her mental status and neurological
examination combined with the subtle CT results, the stroke
service conferred with the attending internist and family.  Since
the family strongly believed that the patient would not want
to live in a severely debilitated state due to a stroke, they
agreed, after reviewing the risks and benefits, that the
patient should receive tissue plasminogen activator.  This
occurred 105 minutes after the event was presumed to have begun.
The patient received a total of 45 mg of TPA with 4.5 mg bolus
and then the remaining 40.5 mg over one hour.  The patient
was transferred to the intensive care unit for blood pressure
management.  The patient initially showed only moderate
response to the TPA.  The goal blood pressure set for her was
systolic of 140 to 180.  Because she was going over 180, the
patient received IV labetalol.  Over the next several days,
the patient had remarkable improvement in both her mental
status and neurological examination.  Follow-up head CT on
[**2974-6-23**] showed no acute hemorrhage or mass effect, no acute
infarction.  Unexpectedly, the patient returned back to her
prestroke baseline.  She was once again able to walk with a
walker, was easily able to verbalize, and her right-sided
hemiparesis and gaze deviation resolved.  The patient
remained with a baseline dementia which she appears to have
had on admission and several months prior to that point.  The
patient was started on aspirin.  The stroke team also
recommended that she be started on Plavix.  The patient
doesn't likely need any special stroke rehabilitation as she
has come back to her prestroke state.

2. Atrial fibrillation:  The patient was noted to be atrially
paced at 70 beats per minute on admission.  She was not in
atrial fibrillation.  The patient's stroke is likely embolic
in nature.  Its origin is unknown.  The patient was not
anticoagulated after her pacer placement, which may have led
to clot formation.  The patient may also have thrown a piece
of atheroma from one of her large vessels.  Anticoagulation
with Coumadin was closely considered and discussed with the
family.  It was explained that the patient has a reasonably
high risk of having another stroke given that she already
threw an embolus.  It is tough to exactly quantify her risk
for reembolization, but it is probably around 10% per year.
The patient likely has at least 3-5% improvement with
Coumadin over aspirin alone per year.  However, the morbidity
associated with Coumadin in someone who is a genuine fall
risk has to be closely considered.  At this point in time,
the family has decided not to pursue anticoagulation with
Coumadin.  For this reason, the patient does not receive any
further work-up for her embolism.  In the future, if Coumadin
is even considered, she will need an echocardiogram and
likely carotid ultrasound.  The patient doubtfully would be a
carotid stent candidate.

3. Failure to thrive:  As already discussed in prior
discharge summary, the patient was found to be subclinically
treated for her hypothyroidism given her admission TSH of 40.
The patient's Levoxyl dose was increased to 75 mcg p.o. q.d.
The patient's TSH was rechecked on [**2974-6-27**] and she was still
found to have a TSH of 41.  It is likely that this is an
increase in circulating thyroid hormone and thus suppression
of her TSH will occur over a few weeks' time.  Currently it
is probably premature to further increase her levothyroxine
dose, especially given her history of atrial tachycardia and
the secondary risk of further embolism.  Given the patient's
progressing dementia, Aricept may be considered once again,
especially once she is euthyroid again.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Neurontin 100 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Toprol XL 12.5 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Artificial Tears 1-2 drops OU p.r.n.
5. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6. Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Levothyroxine 75 mcg p.o. q.d.
9. Tylenol 325 to 650 mg p.o. q. 4-6 hours p.r.n.
10. Digoxin 0.0625 mg p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was discharged to [**Hospital3 2592**] facility.  She will need to have her TSH
rechecked two weeks from [**2974-6-28**] to assess her progress with
the increased levothyroxine dose.  If her TSH is still high,
her free T4 should also be rechecked and consider increasing
her levothyroxine dose to 100 mcg p.o. q.d.  The patient
should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her cardiologist.  The
patient's Neurontin dose is currently 100 mg p.o. q.d., this
is for her trigeminal neuralgia.  This can be titrated up to
400 mg p.o. q.d. as tolerated.  It should be held for
sedation or mental status changes.  The patient should
continue aspirin and Plavix for her post stroke care.  As
already discussed, she will take no Coumadin at this point in
time.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Acute left MCA stroke.
2. Atrial fibrillation, status post pacer placement.
3. History of atrial tachycardia.
4. Hypothyroidism.
5. Anorexia.
6. Dementia.

     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior chest radiograph of [**2974-4-23**].
     
     This exam is limited by patient positioning with the patient in a somewhat
     lordotic position and slightly rotated to the right.  There is a pacemaker
     overlying the left hemithorax with pacemaker wires in stable position. The
     heart size and mediastinal contours are stable. The pulmonary vascularity is
     normal with no evidence of failure.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or
     pleural effusion.  Visualized portions of the lung fields are clear with no
     evidence of parenchymal consolidation or pulmonary nodules.  The left lower
     lung zone is obscured by an overlying pacemaker.  There is probable
     atelectasis at the left lung base.
     
     Bone windows show diffuse osteopenia with extensive degenerative change within
     the thoracic spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Limited exam secondary to patient positioning. No evidence of
     definite pneumonia.

     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the prior study of [**2974-6-23**].
     Intraparenchymal hemorrhage is present within the left posterior temporal
     lobe, measuring 3 cm in diameter.  There is minimal associated mass effect, as
     the patient has age-appropriate generalized atrophy of the brain parenchyma.
     There is no shift of the normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.  The
     appearance of this hemorrhage is most consistent with underlying amyloid
     angiopathy.
     
     There is moderate mucosal thickening within the ethmoid air cells bilaterally.
     Prominent calcification is present within the cavernous carotid arteries.  The
     visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Left temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, as described above.

     Neuro:  Neuro checks ecvery 1 hr as of this time.  So far no changes noted since arrival to Micu.  Pt recieved dilantin load and is to recieve dose every 8 hrs, dilantin lvel 18.2 at 2000.  Repeat head ct at 2000 showed no icrease in size of bleed.  

     Social:  Daghters and granddaughters in with pt, daughter stayed in rm all night.  Appear very caring and appropriatly concerned, do understand the potential outcomes.  Advised that removing c-collar could be detrimental to mothers wellbeing.  Daughter who is hcp reports understanding the risk of removing hard collar and placing soft collar on pt.  Wants mother to be comfortable.  NSICU team aware of daughters decision.  

     Integument:  Skin appears to be in very good condition, no areas of breakdown noted.   Pt appear to have foot drop in lt foot, may be sequelie of polio.
