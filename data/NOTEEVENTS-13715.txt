Admission Date:  [**2696-4-11**]     Discharge Date:  [**2696-4-27**]

Date of Birth:   [**2616-12-5**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 79-year-old male
with history of hypertension transferred to the Coronary Care
Unit following respiratory failure and hypercapnia on the
floor requiring intubation.  History from spouse since the
patient is intubated and sedated reports approximately 1-1.5
weeks ago the patient started to complain of a cold (with
productive cough, increased shortness of breath, and dyspnea
on exertion).  Called the PCP who started Zithromax for
presumed community acquired pneumonia, no chest x-ray, no
culture, or data.

The patient's symptoms increased to the point where he is not
able to [**Doctor Last Name 292**] secondary to shortness of breath.  No chest
pain, no palpitations, no weight changes, or lower extremity
edema.  Wife reports increased dyspnea on exertion.  He could
not walk in the room without becoming extremely short of
breath, fatigue, and decided the morning of admission to go
to the Emergency Department.  In the Emergency Department,
the patient was found to be nonresponsive.  Arterial blood
gas showed 7.14, 72, 109 on CPAP.  Laboratories showed a BMP
of 690, normal less than 150 with a chest x-ray showing
bilateral pulmonary edema.  The patient was started on CPAP
and diuresed with Lasix.  His symptoms improved and the
patient was transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for further care.

Upon arrival to the floor, he was found to be lethargic with
decreased responsiveness.  Arterial blood gas showed 7.10,
96, and 41.  The patient was intubated and transferred to the
CCU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Hyperlipidemia.
3. Osteomyelitis at age 14.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Timolol 10 mg bid.
2. Norvasc 5 mg po q day.
3. Lipitor 10 mg q day.
4. Zithromax for two days.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Rectal cancer and coronary artery disease.
Smoker quit 30 years ago, approximately 60 pack years.
Patient no alcohol use.  Lives at home with wife, two
children in area.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  He was sedated and intubated, no
jugular venous distention, no lymphadenopathy.  Oropharynx is
clear.  Mucous membranes moist.  Cardiovascular:
Tachycardic, III/VI systolic murmur radiating to both
carotids.  PMI increased, but not to place, soft S2.
Pulmonary:  Unable to properly assess.  Abdomen is soft,
nontender, nondistended, bowel sounds positive.  Extremities:
 No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 13.3, hematocrit 39.1,
platelets 267, INR of 1.2.  Urine is positive for blood.
Chem-7:  Sodium 141, potassium 3.8, chloride 104, CO2 25, BUN
18, creatinine of 1, platelets of 292, magnesium of 1.6, PO4
is 6.2, calcium 8.7.  AST 88, ALT of 44, LDH 231, alkaline
phosphatase 109.  T bilirubin of 0.7, lactate of 1.6.  CK 86
increased to 102, troponin 3.3, MB index of 9.8.

Electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm, normal axis, left
ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial abnormality, ST changes
in precordial leads, ST depressions in V5 and V6, ST
elevations, normal intervals.  More pronounced when
tachycardic.

A transthoracic echocardiogram for this patient showed severe
aortic stenosis with approximate valve area of 0.7.  This was
followed by a cardiac catheterization on [**2696-4-13**] and found
to have a pulmonary capillary wedge of 14 with severe aortic
stenosis, mean gradient of 65 mm and a valve area of 0.54.
He also had diffuse coronary artery disease with 20% left
main, a 60% left anterior descending artery, a mid and
proximal circumflex lesion of approximately 30%, right
coronary artery of mid 40% and 100% distal right coronary
artery.

The patient did rule in for myocardial infarction.  CT Surgery
was consulted to assess for aortic valve replacement and CABG. CT
Surgery agreed that aortic valve replacement/CABG  was indicated
in this patient.
Preoperative evaluation revealed a 90-100% stenosis of the
right coronary artery. In view of the heavily calcified aorta and
therefore the need for circulatory arrest during surgery it was
felt that the risk of stroke was high and would require carotid
intervention prior to that. After careful review of the options
carotid stenting was recommended. This was successfully performed
on [**4-16**]. He was then put on aspirin and Plavix with
plans to wait two weeks for the surgery while controlling the
patient's heart failure on the floor.  Patient was extubated
and did well in the CCU.  He was transferred to the PCU
subsequently.
While in the PCU the patient had a recurrent episode of pulmonary
edema requiring transfer back to the CCU as well as reintubation
He also developed hemoptysis which was evaluated and felt to be
predominantly related to his CHF.An IABP was place on [**4-21**] to
optimize his hemodynamics and surgery was scheduled for [**4-23**].
Prior to the scheduled surgery the patient developed a
leukocytosis with gm + cocci in his sputum. The surgery was
cancelled by the cardiac surgical team and the patient evaluated
by ID. Antibiotic treatment was advised and their recommendations
followed. Although there was a concern about a positive blood
culture as well that was ultimately concluded to probably be a
contaminant.
The patient was successfully extubated on [**4-24**]. While in the CCU
the patient had some recurrent hemoptysis (evaluated by
pulmonary) and he began to develop renal insufficiency.On [**4-26**] he
was noted to have an ischemic left lower extremity despite being
on systemic heparin . He was evaluated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 134**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]-
the IABP was removed. The renal service was also consulted due to
a rising creatinine and they felt that the acute renal failure
was possibly related to emboli from the IABP/aorta.CT surgery did
not feel there was any role for urgent cardiac surgery at this
time.

On the night of 05/04, patient developed high
grade transaminitis with AST and ALTs in the thousands, mild
scleral icterus with bilirubin approximately 1.5. Lactate was
initially stable throughout the night in the range of 2-3, but
then rose dramatically to 9.

In addition, the patient began to decompensate with
hypotension requiring Neo-Synephrine and dopamine drips as
well as fluid boluses to maintain MAPS above 90.  He was also
having seizure-like activity and required increased doses of
Fentanyl, diazepam, and Haldol for sedation.

As the patient's condition deteriorated, CCU fellow and
attending were contacted as well as Surgery to evaluate for a
possible mesenteric ischemia and acute abdomen.  The team was
united in feeling that any intervention at this time would be
a high risk of mortality and more likely that would not only
prolong an inevitable decline.  The family was contacted and
told of the patient's grave prognosis and instructed to come
in as soon as possible.

Family arrived, and the seriousness of the condition and
prognosis were explained to them.  After discussion, the
family decided that it would not be consistent with the
wishes of Mr. [**Known patient lastname 9550**] to become dialysis dependent or
prolonged existence on a ventilator.  Spiritual counseling
was brought in the early morning of 05/05.  The family
decided to withdraw care.  Given the underlying medical
conditions, the Medical and Surgical teams involved fully
agreed with this decision.  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 9550**] passed away at 7:45 am
on [**4-27**].

CAUSE OF DEATH:  Respiratory arrest secondary to congestive
heart failure and renal failure.

HOSPITALIZATION DIAGNOSES:
1. Critical aortic stenosis.
2. Congestive heart failure.
3. Coronary artery disease.
4. Pneumonia.
5. Hemoptysis.
6. Acute renal failure.
7. Acute hepatitis.
8. Lower extremity vascular arterial thromboembolism.
9. Probable mesenteric ischemia.
10. Hypertension.
11. Atrial fibrillation.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Aneurysm.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images of the chest, abdomen
     and pelvis using a CTA protocol.
     
     CONTRAST:  150 cc Optiray IV due to fast bolus.
     
     CHEST CTA FINDINGS:  There is diffuse atherosclerotic disease of the ascending
     and descending aorta. There is a focal linear endoluminal abnormality
     identified along the left posterior aspect of the descending aorta, Series 3,
     Image 32.  This may represent a small focal dissection or ulcerative plaque.
     At the level of the main pulmonary artery, the ascending aorta is 4.0 x 3.9
     cm, the descending aorta is 2.6 x 2.3 cm, and the main pulmonary artery is 3.0
     cm.  There is dense calcification of the aortic valve.  There is mild
     cardiomegaly.  There is no pericardial effusion.
     
     There are bilateral pleural effusions, moderate in size, right greater than
     left. There is bilateral septal thickening with ground-glass opacity. The
     findings likely represent congestive heart failure.  There is a 1 cm pleural-
     based opacity in the right upper lobe laterally, Series 3, Image 23, which may
     represent focal atelectasis.  Mild emphysematous changes are also identified
     bilaterally, particularly at the apices.  Tracheobronchial tree is patent.
     There are small mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest in the AP window,
     measuring 1.5 x 0.7 cm.
     
     ABDOMINAL CT WITH IV CONTRAST FINDINGS:
     
     There are multiple calcifications in the liver and spleen, consistent with
     calcified granuloma.  No enhancing liver lesions are identified.  There is
     mild atrophy of the pancreas. There is significant vascular calcification. The
     gallbladder, adrenal glands are unremarkable.  There are bilateral simple
     renal cysts.  There is a hypodense lesion in the inferior pole of the right
     kidney measuring 1.1 cm with a high-density centrally. This may represent
     calcification; however, it is incompletely evaluated on this CT examination.
     Therefore, ultrasound or a dedicated renal CT is recommended for further
     evaluation.  There is no free fluid.  There is no infrarenal AAA. There is
     diffuse atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta. The celiac axis, SMA
     and [**Female First Name (un) **] are patent.  There are two right renal arteries. There is a single
     left renal artery.  Visualized loops of bowel are normal in contour and
     caliber.
                                                                 (Over)

     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST FINDINGS:
     
     There is a Foley catheter within the bladder. There is minimal air within the
     bladder, likely from Foley catheter insertion.  There is no free fluid.  The
     large bowel is normal in contour and caliber.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate degenerative changes throughout the lower thoracic
     and lumbar spine.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     There is ectasia of the ascending aorta, as described above.  There is diffuse
     atherosclerotic disease of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta. There
     is severe atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta.
     
     There is a focal linear abnormality along the posterior left aspect of the
     descending aorta as described above. This may represent a focal dissection or
     ulcerated plaque.
     
     Septal thickening with ground-glass opacity in the lungs and bilateral pleural
     effusions, likely represent CHF.
     
     Calcified granuloma in the liver and spleen.
     
     Bilateral simple cysts.  There is a hypodense lesion in the inferior pole of
     the right kidney posteriorly with a central high attenuation focus, which may
     represent calcification.  Dedicated ultrasound or CT is recommended for
     further evaluation of this finding.
     
     Multiplanar reformations were essential in delineating the anatomy and
     pathology as described above.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Aneurysm.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images of the chest, abdomen
     and pelvis using a CTA protocol.
     
     CONTRAST:  150 cc Optiray IV due to fast bolus.
     
     CHEST CTA FINDINGS:  There is diffuse atherosclerotic disease of the ascending
     and descending aorta. There is a focal linear endoluminal abnormality
     identified along the left posterior aspect of the descending aorta, Series 3,
     Image 32.  This may represent a small focal dissection or ulcerative plaque.
     At the level of the main pulmonary artery, the ascending aorta is 4.0 x 3.9
     cm, the descending aorta is 2.6 x 2.3 cm, and the main pulmonary artery is 3.0
     cm.  There is dense calcification of the aortic valve.  There is mild
     cardiomegaly.  There is no pericardial effusion.
     
     There are bilateral pleural effusions, moderate in size, right greater than
     left. There is bilateral septal thickening with ground-glass opacity. The
     findings likely represent congestive heart failure.  There is a 1 cm pleural-
     based opacity in the right upper lobe laterally, Series 3, Image 23, which may
     represent focal atelectasis.  Mild emphysematous changes are also identified
     bilaterally, particularly at the apices.  Tracheobronchial tree is patent.
     There are small mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest in the AP window,
     measuring 1.5 x 0.7 cm.
     
     ABDOMINAL CT WITH IV CONTRAST FINDINGS:
     
     There are multiple calcifications in the liver and spleen, consistent with
     calcified granuloma.  No enhancing liver lesions are identified.  There is
     mild atrophy of the pancreas. There is significant vascular calcification. The
     gallbladder, adrenal glands are unremarkable.  There are bilateral simple
     renal cysts.  There is a hypodense lesion in the inferior pole of the right
     kidney measuring 1.1 cm with a high-density centrally. This may represent
     calcification; however, it is incompletely evaluated on this CT examination.
     Therefore, ultrasound or a dedicated renal CT is recommended for further
     evaluation.  There is no free fluid.  There is no infrarenal AAA. There is
     diffuse atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta. The celiac axis, SMA
     and [**Female First Name (un) **] are patent.  There are two right renal arteries. There is a single
     left renal artery.  Visualized loops of bowel are normal in contour and
     caliber.
                                                                 (Over)

     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST FINDINGS:
     
     There is a Foley catheter within the bladder. There is minimal air within the
     bladder, likely from Foley catheter insertion.  There is no free fluid.  The
     large bowel is normal in contour and caliber.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate degenerative changes throughout the lower thoracic
     and lumbar spine.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     There is ectasia of the ascending aorta, as described above.  There is diffuse
     atherosclerotic disease of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta. There
     is severe atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta.
     
     There is a focal linear abnormality along the posterior left aspect of the
     descending aorta as described above. This may represent a focal dissection or
     ulcerated plaque.
     
     Septal thickening with ground-glass opacity in the lungs and bilateral pleural
     effusions, likely represent CHF.
     
     Calcified granuloma in the liver and spleen.
     
     Bilateral simple cysts.  There is a hypodense lesion in the inferior pole of
     the right kidney posteriorly with a central high attenuation focus, which may
     represent calcification.  Dedicated ultrasound or CT is recommended for
     further evaluation of this finding.
     
     Multiplanar reformations were essential in delineating the anatomy and
     pathology as described above.

     INDICATION:  MRA to assess intracranial circulation. Previous CVA. 80-90%
     right sided internal carotid stenosis by ultrasound with 40% left sided
     stenosis.  Aortic stenosis going for valve replacement.  Pre-operative.
     
     COMPARISONS: None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2 weighted MR imaging of the brain plus 3D MR
     angiographic imaging of the circle of [**Location (un) **].
     
     BRAIN MRI:  There is an area of encephalomalacia in the right occipital lobe
     with associated increased FLAIR signal abnormality.  In addition, there are
     bilateral areas of increased T2 signal in the periventricular and subcortical
     white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, which is nonspecific in etiology but
     probably represents chronic microvascular infarction in this patient. There is
     prominence of the sulci representing brain atrophy of a global nature. There
     are no masses identified.
     
     BRAIN MRA:  The vessels of the circle of [**Location (un) **] and their tributaries
     demonstrate robust flow signal.  There are no areas of perceptible stenosis or
     aneurysmal dilatation.  There is a minute fenestration in the proximal portion
     of the basilar artery incidentally noted.

cardiac-> pt arrived in afib w/rates >100. the intern was called and the pt received a total of 10mg iv lopressor and 25mg po lopressor. he converted back into a sinus rhythm w/rates 80-100's after approc 1hr. he was also started on a lasix qtt @5mg/hr to maintain a uop >75cc/hr. 
ccu team to consult cardiac [**Doctor First Name **] re: avr although the surgical team plans to wait 7-10 days s/p cath before attempting surgery.

neuro-> pt is oriented x3 but has been restless at times. he has been confused in the past, receiving haldol during his stay in the ccu.

gi-> abd is soft, nontender w/+bs. he had a small, brown stool x1 on his arrival to the micu. he has been npo except for meds overnoc. ?need to keep npo d/t tenuous respiratory status.

gu-> pt was restarted on a lasix qtt ~2:30am. the goal is to increase the qtt rate by 5mg/hr until goal output is achieved. per ccu team, sbp's in the 80's are acceptable. 

heme-> hct is 26 this am after receiving a u prbc's last noc. the pt has apparently had hemoptosis in the past, and as a result, he was taken off of heparin.

      79 year old man with critical AS on iabp until thought to be throwing clots.    
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      new onset abd pain with highly elevated LFTs, ARF. please assess liver for 
      lesions and doppler for blood flow in hepatic artery.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 79 year old male with critical aortic stenosis and new onset acute
     renal failure. Elevated liver function test.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Complete abdominal ultrasound and renal ultrasound with doppler.
     
     COMPARISON: Renal ultrasound performed 5 hours earlier.
     
     FINDINGS: The liver is diffusely hyperechoic, consistent with fatty
     infiltration of the liver. No focal abnormalities are detected. The portal
     veins and hepatic arteries demonstrate normal doppler wave forms. There is no
     intra or extrahepatic ductal dilatation.  The common bile duct measures
     4.6 mm. There is sludge within a dilated gallbladder but no evidence of
     cholecystitis.
     
     The right and left kidneys demonstrate preserved renal architecture without
     evidence of hydronephrosis.  Both renal arteries and veins are patent.
     Suboptimal arterial wave forms are demonstrated.  There arterial flow within
     the upper pole of the right kidney with a resistive index of .7.  The lower
     pole demonstrates arterial wave form with a resitive index of .5. Within the
     left kidney, arterial wave form within the upper pole was obtained, with
     evaluation of the mid and lower pole was limited.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Diffusely hyperechoic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.  Some forms
     of liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis cannot be
     excluded.
     2. Patent hepatic vasculature.
     3. Limited doppler analysis of both kidneys as described above.
     4. Sludge-filled, dilated gallbladder.
