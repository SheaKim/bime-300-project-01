Chief Complaint:
""my legs are swollen"" x 2 weeks.  
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Open Splenectomy [**2806-7-25**]
 
History of Present Illness:
37M with h/o HIV/AIDS (last CD4 12, VL 7000) with chronic 
medical issues related to AIDS including diarrhea, sinusitis, 
pancyotpenia, chronic fevers that are unchanged. Essentially, Mr 
[**Known patient lastname 9326**] has experienced (chronic) BLE edema that has progressed 
to a point where he was referred for inpatient management.  
Recent w/u in May included Echo and LENIs that were 
unremarkable; he was discharged on lasix to control anasarca. He 
states that lasix is not as  effective as it used to be (160  
Qam and 80 Qpm).  Pt relates that his ankles and area behind the 
knees are sore and making ambulation difficult; this is related 
only to this acute event.  He states that when he stands, he can 
almost feel the fluid rush to his feet.  He has no orthopnea, 
new SOB, CP, PND.  Last echo in 5/05 with EF >55%, no diastolic 
dysfxn.  Received 120 IV lasix on arrival to floor with prompt 
diuresis > 700 cc.workup demonstrated no evidence of CHF or 
venous occlusion.  He was finally d/c to home w/ lasix to 
control his anasarca.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 9326**] is a gentleman who expired on the surgical service 
on [**2806-8-4**] of respiratory failure secondary to acute renal 
failure and complications from advanced AIDS status-post open 
splenectomy on [**2806-7-25**]. He was initially on the medical service 
prior to his surgery. A brief summary of his hospital course is 
follows: 

Mr [**Known patient lastname 9326**] was admitted on [**2806-6-26**] for inpatient management of 
his anasarca, chronic diarrhea, and chronic pancytopenia.  

With regards to his HIV, his last CD4 12, viral load 7000.  
Treated w/ HAART, home meds continued (abacavir, lamivudine, 
zidovudine, enfuvirtide, ritonavir, dapsone for pcp [**Name9 (PRE) 1885**], 
famciclovir, fluconazole).  

With regards to his anasarca, this was postulated to be 
secondary to low oncotic pressure secondary to chronic 
pancytopenia as well as lymphatic insufficiency. Albumin level 
was checked several times, however, and was > 3, leading us to 
consider a multi-factorial etiology for the edema. CT abdomen 
was done to assess for retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy as a 
source of venous occlusion, but it was negative.  Echo on this 
hospitalization revealed no significant change from the previous 
study in 5/05, with EF >55%.  Edema was managed initially with 
high-dose lasix, and then with metolazone.  Diuretics caused 
only marginal improvement in LE edema, and caused the patient to 
be hypovolemic and hyponatremic.  Diuretics were discontinued 
and patient was placed in compression stockings.

With regards to his diarrhea, the patient was found to have C. 
diff positive stools and was started on a course of Flagyl for 
treatment. 

From an infectious disease standpoint, intermittent and chronic 
low-grade fevers gave way to frank fever spikes on day 3 of 
hospitalization, along with development of R ear pain and a 
coincidentally positive sputum for AFB that was taken as an 
outpatient. Cultures of nose and ear revealed GPC in pairs from 
the sinus and pseudomonas from the ear. MRI ordered to assess 
extent of pseudomonal infection (see below) indicated diffuse 
(R>L) meningeal enhancement c/w menigitis. He was maintained on 
several courses of empiric antibiotics, as well as IV acyclovir 
possible HSV lesion in his ear.  IV acyclovir course completed 
prior to viral culture results. He developed acute R ear pain 
with serosanguinous drainage early in this hospitalization, and 
ENT was promptly consulted for input. ENT input regarding 
mastoiditis indicates that no surgical intervention required 
even if pt were appropriate candidate.  He had one sputum 
positive for AFB on [**2806-6-20**]. He was placed on resppiratory 
precautions until 3 sets of negative sputums were obtained (no 
sputum samples from this hospitalization have been positive).  
He was treated empiracally for presumed MAC.

With regards this his pancytpoenia , this was postulated to be 
initially to be secondary to his  HIV marrow suppression. Recent 
BM biopsy from [**5-21**] showed hypocellularity w/ no marrow 
infection, though cultures had never been sent.  Patient 
experienced steady decline in cellular counts which prompted 
reevaluation of initial hypothesis and data. Marrow showed viral 
inclusion bodies (though there was no evidence of viral 
organsims), and therefore, serologies for CMV and Parvovirus B19 
were sent.  He was treated with IVIG 1g/kg/day to treat possible 
parvovirus and intiated on Procrit, 40,000 u/week.  Surgery was 
consulted and due to his severe thrombocytopenia, the decision 
was made to procede with salvage splenectomy. 

He underwent splenectomy via open technique on [**2806-7-25**] (please 
see the operative note of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for full details). 
Post-operatively, he initially did well and was extubated and 
transferred out of the ICU by post-op day 3 and started on a 
clear liquid diet. However, he began to have oliguric renal 
failure and was transferred back to the ICU for close 
monitoring. Within a day his renal failure became anuric and he 
presented with an encephalopathic picture. Renal consultation 
assessed the patient's renal failure as multifactorial in 
nature, including HIV nephropathy, renal failure secondary to 
amicar treatment for his MAC, and perioperative fluid changes. 
He was emergently intubated for mental status changes 
comprimising respiration. He was dialyzed for 4 consecutive days 
starting on [**2806-7-30**], however there was marginal improvement in 
his renal function. While is platelet counts did not drop 
post-splenectomy, he continued to present with clinical bleeding 
from his incision sites and it was presumed that his platelets 
were poorly functional secondary to uremia. Hematology 
recommended DDAVP and FFP which were given, as well as platelet 
transfusions. On [**2806-8-4**] a family meeting was held and the 
decision was made by the patient's health care proxy to make him 
comfort measures only. He was extubated and expired shortly 
afterwards. His family members were present at his bedside.

     HISTORY:  37-year-old man with headache and earache.  Blood and pus from the
     right ear.  Evaluate for mastoiditis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast CT thin slice axial images through the temporal bone
     with sagittal and coronal reformats.
     
     FINDINGS:  As on the prior examination of [**2806-4-15**], there is
     pansinusitis.  There has been minimal improvement in the aeration of the
     ethmoid, sphenoid, and maxillary sinuses.  However, significant residual sinus
     changes remain.  Since prior examination, the left mastoid air cells have
     improved with no residual fluid; however, the right mastoid air cells are not
     completely opacified.  The right-sided ossicles appear normal.  However, there
     appears to be a small defect visualized in the tegmen tympani on the coronal
     reconstructions.  Sinus plate and scutum are intact.  There is no erosion of
     the petrous apex.  There is opacification of the middle ear cavity.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Opacification of the right mastoid air cells.  There appears to
     be a small defect visualized in the tegmen tympani on the coronal
     reconstructions.  No additional areas of bony erosion are seen.  Opacification
     of the middle ear also identified.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      R/O mastoiditis of R side

     WET READ: JTRe FRI [**2806-6-30**] 4:37 PM
      Right mastoid air cell opacification.  Small defect visualized in the tegmun
      tympani.  Sinus plate, scutum, and ossicles are intact.
      Pansinusitis as before (with minimal improvement in aeration).
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT *ABNORMAL!
     HISTORY:  37-year-old man with headache and earache.  Blood and pus from the
     right ear.  Evaluate for mastoiditis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast CT thin slice axial images through the temporal bone
     with sagittal and coronal reformats.
     
     FINDINGS:  As on the prior examination of [**2806-4-15**], there is
     pansinusitis.  There has been minimal improvement in the aeration of the
     ethmoid, sphenoid, and maxillary sinuses.  However, significant residual sinus
     changes remain.  Since prior examination, the left mastoid air cells have
     improved with no residual fluid; however, the right mastoid air cells are not
     completely opacified.  The right-sided ossicles appear normal.  However, there
     appears to be a small defect visualized in the tegmen tympani on the coronal
     reconstructions.  Sinus plate and scutum are intact.  There is no erosion of
     the petrous apex.  There is opacification of the middle ear cavity.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Opacification of the right mastoid air cells.  There appears to
     be a small defect visualized in the tegmen tympani on the coronal
     reconstructions.  No additional areas of bony erosion are seen.  Opacification
     of the middle ear also identified.

     TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained
     following the administration of oral contrast and 150 cc of Optiray.
     
     Comparison was made to a prior study of [**2806-4-16**].
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Images through the lung bases demonstrate
     bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right.  There is a nodular opacity at
     the periphery of the right lower lobe seen on series 3, image 5, unchanged
     from the prior study, measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter, likely the
     insertion of the diaphragm.
     
     The gallbladder, adrenal glands, and liver are unremarkable.  There is no
     ascites.  The pancreas is unremarkable.  No hydronephrosis or hydroureter on
     either side.  Within the mid pole of the left kidney, there is a 5-mm focus of
     low attenuation that is too small to fully characterize.
     
     There is splenomegaly.
     
     Again seen scattered throughout the mesentry are numerous mesenteric lymph
     nodes.  The largest of these again is near the root of the mesentry, measuring
     approximately 1 cm in size.
     
     There is no bowel obstruction.  No dilated loops of bowel are seen.  No
     thickened loops of bowel are identified.
     
     There is no free air or free fluid in the abdomen.
     
     No IVC obstruction is identified.  The iliac veins and inferior vena cava are

     INDICATION:  37-year-old male with AIDS, low CD4 count, purulent discharge
     from the right ear.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT imaging of the temporal bones performed after the
     intravenous administration of 150 cc of Optiray.  Non-ionic contrast was used
     due to patient debility.  Additional reformatted imaging in the coronal plane
     was also performed.  Reference made to a prior non-contrast study from the
     previous day.
     
     CT OF THE TEMPORAL BONES WITH CONTRAST:  There is again seen complete
     opacification of the right middle ear as well as the majority of the right
     mastoid air cells.  The tegmen tympani and the roof of the mastoid air cells
     within the right temporal bone are indistinct and not well identified on this
     examination.  No other areas of definite bone destruction are identified.  The
     ossicles are symmetric in appearance.  The structures of the inner ear are
     also symmetric in appearance.  No areas of abnormal enhancement are identified
     in the soft tissues surrounding the right temporal bone or in limited
     assessment of intracranial structures adjacent to the right temporal bone.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Opacification of the right middle ear and mastoid air cells that is
     consistent with the patient's clinical history of right-sided otomastoiditis.
     The tegmen tympani and the roof of the mastoid air cells on the right are not
     well seen.  Given the technical limitations of this contrast-enhanced CT, if
     there is clinical suspicion for intracranial extension of infection in the
     patient with a right-sided otomastoiditis, a dedicated MRI with gadolinium is
     recommended.
     2.  No evidence of a drainable fluid collection within limited assessment of
     the soft tissues adjacent to the right temporal bone.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI of the brain using T1 and T2 sequences and
     diffusion-weighted imaging.  Multiplanar imaging of the IAC'S with pre- and
     post-gadolinium imaging.  Axial 3D-FIESTA images were corrupt and
     nondiagnostic.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     HISTORY:  37-year-old with HIV and sinusitis and mastoiditis.  The integrity
     of the right tegmen tympani was questioned on prior CT'S.  Evaluate IAC'S.
     
     FINDINGS:  On today's examination, there is pansinusitis.  There is T2 signal
     abnormality within all of the sinuses.  Minimal residual fluid remains within
     the left mastoid air cells.  However, the right mastoid air cells are filled
     with fluid.  These findings are consistent with a prior CT.  There is no
     evidence of significant intracranial collection.  However, on the
     post-gadolinium imaging, demonstrates asymmetric enhancement, pachymeningeal
     enhancement, right greater than left.  This is the enhancement and thickness,
     and the enhancement is most significant over the right tegmen tympani.  These
     findings likely represent meningitis.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 1383**] was contacted with these
     findings on [**2806-7-2**] at 5:30 p.m.
     
     The expected vascular flow Voids are present.  Specifically, the right sigmoid
     sinus appears normal on this study.  The [**Doctor Last Name 63**]-white matter differentiation is
     preserved.  There is no intracranial T2 signal abnormality.  The lateral
     ventricles are normal in size and configuration.  There are no enhancing
     intracranial masses.
     
     No areas of slow diffusion are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Right sided pachymeningeal enhancement most prominent at the area

     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI of the brain using T1 and T2 sequences and
     diffusion-weighted imaging.  Multiplanar imaging of the IAC'S with pre- and
     post-gadolinium imaging.  Axial 3D-FIESTA images were corrupt and
     nondiagnostic.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     HISTORY:  37-year-old with HIV and sinusitis and mastoiditis.  The integrity
     of the right tegmen tympani was questioned on prior CT'S.  Evaluate IAC'S.
     
     FINDINGS:  On today's examination, there is pansinusitis.  There is T2 signal
     abnormality within all of the sinuses.  Minimal residual fluid remains within
     the left mastoid air cells.  However, the right mastoid air cells are filled
     with fluid.  These findings are consistent with a prior CT.  There is no
     evidence of significant intracranial collection.  However, on the
     post-gadolinium imaging, demonstrates asymmetric enhancement, pachymeningeal
     enhancement, right greater than left.  This is the enhancement and thickness,
     and the enhancement is most significant over the right tegmen tympani.  These
     findings likely represent meningitis.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 1383**] was contacted with these
     findings on [**2806-7-2**] at 5:30 p.m.
     
     The expected vascular flow Voids are present.  Specifically, the right sigmoid
     sinus appears normal on this study.  The [**Doctor Last Name 63**]-white matter differentiation is
     preserved.  There is no intracranial T2 signal abnormality.  The lateral
     ventricles are normal in size and configuration.  There are no enhancing
     intracranial masses.
     
     No areas of slow diffusion are identified.

     INDICATIONS:  AIDS and persistent fevers.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Volumetric CT imaging of the chest was performed with 100 cc of
     Optiray IV contrast.  Images were reconstructed at 5-mm intervals in standard
     and high-spatial frequency algorithm, and at 1.25 mm in standard algorithm.
     
     COMPARISON:  Chest CT scan from [**2806-6-29**].
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is no new pathological axillary,
     hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  There is a stable small pericardial
     effusion with low Hounsfield units.  There are new tiny bilateral
     nonhemorrhagic posteriorly layering pleural effusions.  This is associated
     with likely bibasilar atelectasis.  Atelectasis is slightly more extensive in
     the left lower lobe posteriorly.  Areas of previously seen anterior right
     middle lobe atelectasis or scarring have increased slightly in extent.  Small
     (less than 3 mm) pulmonary nodules are again seen in the right upper lobe
     (image 24), and in the left apex (image 11), which are stable.  There is a
     linear band of opacity along the major fissure which is likely additional
     atelectasis.  No ground-glass opacity or new opacity on the bronchovascular
     bundles.  The bronchial wall thickening is unchanged.  Limited assessment of
     the upper abdomen again shows dramatic splenomegaly.  No osseous lesions
     suspicious for malignancy.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  New small bilateral posteriorly layering nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions.
     Stable pericardial effusion.
     2.  Increasing opacity in the left posterior lower lobe and in the anterior
     right middle lobe laterally.  These have imaging findings consistent with
     atelectasis.  Given the patient's HIV status and continued fever, pneumonia is
     also of concern.  If the symptoms of fever persist despite appropriate
     antibiotic treatment, COP is also on the differential diagnosis.
     3.  Stable splenomegaly.

     subdural space.
     
     COMPARISONS:  MR head done the same day.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial non-contrast MDCT images were obtained through the head.
     
     CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is an extraaxial, subdural collection
     which corresponds to the abnormality seen on the previous MR overlying the
     convexities of the right frontal and posterior parietal lobes.  They are of
     isoattenuation to the surrounding parenchyma.  There is no significant mass
     effect on the adjacent brain, and there is no shift of normally midline
     structures.  Otherwise, there is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage,
     hydrocephalus, or edema.  The [**Doctor Last Name 63**]-white matter differentiation appears intact
     throughout.  The complete opacification of the right-sided mastoid air cells
     consistent with mastoiditis is again identified.  There is also pansinus
     mucosal thickening.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Extraaxial, subdural collections overlying the right frontal and
     posterior parietal lobes, which are isoattenuating to the adjacent brain. With
     this patient's pansinusitis and mastoiditis, this is concerning for a subdural
     empyema.  No significant mass effect on the adjacent brain parenchyma is seen.
     
     These findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 628**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1389**] at the time of the study.

     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images pre- and post-gadolinium
     contrast.  Comparison with MRI of the brain and internal auditory canal, [**7-2**], 2005.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is diffuse meningeal enhancement overlying the right cerebral
     hemisphere.  Superiorly, there appears to be increased fluid in the subdural
     space overlying the right frontal and right parietal regions. It is difficult
     to characterize the subdural collection, but it has increased T1 and T2 signal
     components, as well as internal susceptibility which suggests hemorrhage. In
     part, however, this may be a proteiaceous collection, and therefore could be a
     subdural empyema. The region also diffusely enhances. Right mastoid air cells
     remain filled with fluid; there are scattered fluid- filled mastoid air cells
     on the left, and the frontal sinuses.  Bilateral maxillary sinus, ethmoid
     sinus, and sphenoid sinus mucosal thickening has improved.
     
     No abnormal signal intensity is seen within the brain parenchyma. The brain
     appears structurally normal. Major arterial and venous flow voids are grossly
     normal.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Increased appearance of meningeal enhancement in the meninges overlying
     the right cerebral hemisphere, consistent with meningitis.  Additionally,
     an enlarged subdural fluid collection, particularly in the right frontal and
     right parietal regions, has developed.  This may be a subdural empyema and
     also have blood products within it.  A head CT would be helpful to identify
     any recent hemorrhage.
     2.  Unremarkable MRI appearance of the brain.
     3.  Sinusitis in maxillary sinuses, ethmoid air cells, frontal sinuses, and
     bilateral mastoid air cells (right greater than left).

     effusion with low Hounsfield units.  There are new tiny bilateral
     nonhemorrhagic posteriorly layering pleural effusions.  This is associated

     linear band of opacity along the major fissure which is likely additional
     atelectasis.  No ground-glass opacity or new opacity on the bronchovascular
     bundles.  The bronchial wall thickening is unchanged.  Limited assessment of
     the upper abdomen again shows dramatic splenomegaly.  No osseous lesions
     suspicious for malignancy.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  New small bilateral posteriorly layering nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions.
     Stable pericardial effusion.
     2.  Increasing opacity in the left posterior lower lobe and in the anterior
     right middle lobe laterally.  These have imaging findings consistent with
     atelectasis.  Given the patient's HIV status and continued fever, pneumonia is
     also of concern.  If the symptoms of fever persist despite appropriate
     antibiotic treatment, COP is also on the differential diagnosis.
     3.  Stable splenomegaly.

     Comparison is made to the prior CT scan dated [**2806-6-30**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scanning of the abdomen and pelvis was performed
     without administration of intravenous contrast.  Intravenous contrast was
     withheld secondary to patient's history of acute renal failure.  Coronal and
     sagittal reformations were also obtained.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The visualized lung bases
     demonstrate interval development of bibasilar dependent atelectasis and small
     bilateral pleural effusions.  A small amount of pericardial fluid is also
     noted.  The patient is status post splenectomy with multiple surgical clips
     seen in the splenectomy bed.  A JP drainage catheter is also noted in the left
     upper quadrant.  Overlying skin staples are also noted.  High-density material
     consistent with hemorrhage is demonstrated within the splenectomy bed.  This
     measures up to 13.9 x 7.1 cm extending along the left flank to the level of
     the mid pole of the left kidney.  A trace amount of free fluid is seen
     extending to the pelvis.  There is no free intraperitoneal air.  There is
     layering high-density material in the gallbladder, which could be consistent
     with vicarious excretion of contrast or sludge.  The liver, pancreas,
     adrenals, right kidney and unopacified loops of large and small bowel are
     unremarkable on this noncontrast study.  A tiny calcification consistent with
     a nonobstructing stone is demonstrated in the inferior pole of the left
     kidney.  There is no hydronephrosis or perirenal stranding.  There are diffuse
     changes in the subcutaneous tissues consistent with anasarca.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  A Foley is present within the
     bladder.  The rectum, sigmoid are within normal limits.  There is no pelvic or
     inguinal lymphadenopathy.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Status post splenectomy with acute renal failure, worsening
     mental status, abdominal pain.
     
     Comparison is made to the prior CT scan dated [**2806-6-30**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scanning of the abdomen and pelvis was performed
     without administration of intravenous contrast.  Intravenous contrast was
     withheld secondary to patient's history of acute renal failure.  Coronal and
     sagittal reformations were also obtained.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The visualized lung bases
     demonstrate interval development of bibasilar dependent atelectasis and small
     bilateral pleural effusions.  A small amount of pericardial fluid is also
     noted.  The patient is status post splenectomy with multiple surgical clips
     seen in the splenectomy bed.  A JP drainage catheter is also noted in the left
     upper quadrant.  Overlying skin staples are also noted.  High-density material
     consistent with hemorrhage is demonstrated within the splenectomy bed.  This
     measures up to 13.9 x 7.1 cm extending along the left flank to the level of
     the mid pole of the left kidney.  A trace amount of free fluid is seen
     extending to the pelvis.  There is no free intraperitoneal air.  There is
     layering high-density material in the gallbladder, which could be consistent
     with vicarious excretion of contrast or sludge.  The liver, pancreas,
     adrenals, right kidney and unopacified loops of large and small bowel are

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Rule out portal and/or splenic vein thrombosis                                  
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  37-year-old with AIDS, pancytopenia, post splenectomy on [**7-25**]
     with increasing drainage from the JP drain.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2806-7-23**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The liver appears normal in echogenicity, though slightly coarse in
     echotexture.  No focal hepatic mass is identified.  The gallbladder wall is
     slightly thickened, but there are no stones or sludge.  The common bile duct
     measures 4 mm.  There is no intrahepatic ductal dilation.  There is no
     pericholecystic fluid or gallbladder wall edema.  Limited views of the head of
     the pancreas and body of the pancreas appear normal.  The right kidney
     measures 13.6 cm, and left kidney measures 14.8 cm.  There is no
     hydronephrosis, stone, or mass in either kidney.  Both kidneys demonstrate
     slightly increased cortical echogenicity.  No significant free fluid is seen
     within the abdomen.  There is a right pleural effusion.
     
     Pulsed color Doppler examination of the hepatic vasculature demonstrates
     normal color-flow with normal waveforms within the right, left, and middle
     hepatic veins as well as the left, right, and main portal veins.  Flow within
     the portal vein is hepatopetal.  The splenic vein demonstrates normal color-
     flow at the confluence with the portal vein.  The more distal splenic vein was
     difficult to visualize.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Increased echogenicity of both kidneys consistent with the patient's
     history of renal failure and underlying renal parenchymal disease.
     
     2.  No evidence of portal, hepatic, or splenic vein thrombosis.
     
     3.  No significant ascites within the abdomen.
     
     These findings were discussed with the surgical housestaff caring for the
     patient at the completion of the examination.

HEME: Hct decreased to 26 from 28. Serial hct's q6. Next draw due at 2000.  PTT decreased from 72 to 38 after 1u FFP. INR slowly trending down. Plts pending. 

GI: Abd less distended when compared to yesterday's exam by this RN. Firm area under staples noted to middle of incision. Pt started on trophic TF: Vivonex full str at 10cc/hr. No BM this shift. 

GU: Anuric all shift. Dialyzed today (not completed as of yet...see carevue for amount of fluid removal). 

ID: Afebrile. All HIV meds dc'd. 

ENDO: [**Last Name (un) **] stim test done today. Results pending. No coverage per RISS.

SKIN: Stage II pressure sore to coccyx; duoderm applied. Bleeding from all incision and access sites. 

SOCIAL: Family spoke collectively with this RN ICU, Renal, and Gen [**Doctor First Name 146**] team today at length about POC and pt's wishes.  Family states they do not want support to ""go on forever."" Pt made DNR today (no CPR) and family wants to wait until the middle of the week. If no improvement in mental status after a few more dialysis sessions, family states they would like to re-address CMO/withdrawal of care options with teams. 

ASMT: Pt with advanced HIV, s/p splenectomy complicated by alteration in renal functioning requiring hemodialysis. Alteration in clotting factors. Decompensating mental status yesterday required intubation for comfort/airway protection. 

PLAN: Cont to monitor vs, maintain sedation/comfort, monitor labs, dialysis, skin care, ?CMO/withdrawal of care if family feels there is no improvement by mid week.
