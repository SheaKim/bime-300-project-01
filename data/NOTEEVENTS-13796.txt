CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Sent to the Emergency Department for chest
pain during a stress test.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old male with
a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary
artery bypass graft surgery, insulin dependent-diabetes
mellitus, congestive heart failure, chronic atrial
fibrillation, and chronic renal insufficiency, who is sent to
the Emergency Department after having chest pain and
bilateral arm weakness during his stress test.  He did not
have any associated nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis.  He did
not experience any palpitations.  He describes the chest pain
as more heaviness rather than chest pain.

1. Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
2. Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass
graft surgery.
3. Insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus.
4. Anemia.
5. Gout.
6. Systolic congestive heart failure with an ejection
fraction of less than 20%.
7. Status post pacemaker ICD placement.
8. Chronic renal insufficiency.

ALLERGIES:  Morphine causing nausea.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Gemfibrozil 600 mg twice a day.
2. Lasix 20 mg daily.
3. Altace 5 mg daily.
4. Coumadin 5 mg daily except Sundays 2.5 mg.
5. Digoxin 0.125 mg Monday, Wednesday, [**Last Name (LF) 2869**], [**First Name3 (LF) 9674**].
6. Allopurinol 150 mg daily.
7. Colchicine 0.5 mg q day.
8. Folic acid 1 mg daily.
9. Zebeta 5 mg.
10. Aspirin 325 mg daily.
11. Humalog insulin-sliding scale.
12. NPH insulin, 18 units in the morning, 5 units hs.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, occasional alcohol [**1-2**] drinks
per month, retired systems engineer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.7, heart rate 64, blood
pressure 112/50, respiratory rate 18, and oxygen saturation
is 99% on 2 liters.  General:  Alert and oriented in no acute
distress.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light.  Supple neck.  Jugular venous distention approximately
10 cm above the sternal notch.  Cardiovascular examination:
regular, rate, and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Lungs:  Faint crackles at the bases bilaterally.  Abdomen is
soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  No edema.
Neurologic is alert and oriented.  Cranial nerves II through
XII are grossly intact.  Strength are [**4-3**] bilaterally in
upper and lower extremities.

LABORATORY VALUES:  White blood cell count 5.6, hematocrit
37.3, platelets 124, MCV 100, INR 2.4.  Sodium 135, potassium
5.7, chloride 107, bicarb 16, BUN 97, creatinine 2.7, glucose
224.  Digoxin 0.8.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Showed bigeminy with V-paced beats
alternating with intrinsic beats, left bundle branch block,
no acute changes, no ST-T wave changes.

CHEST X-RAY:  Showed stable cardiomegaly without evidence of
acute cardiopulmonary disease.

Stress test revealed extensive reversible ischemic changes
with an ejection fraction of 19%.  MIBI revealed severe
global hypokinesis with large inferior wall and moderate
anterior apical defects, severe systolic dysfunction with
septal hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 19%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Chest pain/positive stress test:  The patient underwent
cardiac catheterization which revealed severe native vessel
coronary artery disease with one patent saphenous vein graft
to OM graft with two focal stenoses, markedly elevated right
and left sided filling pressures, successful stenting of the
right coronary artery, ostial saphenous vein graft lesion,
and distal saphenous vein graft lesion.  An intra-aortic
balloon pump was placed prophylactically secondary to the
patient's severe systolic dysfunction.  The patient was
transferred to the CCU for monitoring, and was transferred to
the floor after only a short stay.

The patient was given Mucomyst and IV fluid hydration prior
to catheterization in light of his chronic renal
insufficiency.

2. Systolic congestive heart failure:  The patient was
admitted on daily Lasix, ACE inhibitor, digoxin, and a beta
blocker.  His diuretics and ACE inhibitor were held initially
secondary to his acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  On
discharge, the patient was restarted on his ACE inhibitor,
however, his daily Lasix will be held until his follow-up
appointment with his cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The patient
will measure his weights daily, and will notify Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 2859**]
office if his weight increases more than five pounds.

3. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency:  The patient has
chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.5
to 1.8, which is likely secondary to diabetic nephropathy.
On admission, the patient's creatinine was 2.7.  The
patient's Lasix, ACE inhibitor, Allopurinol, and colchicine
were all held because they were felt to be major contributors
to his acute renal failure.  The renal team was consulted.
It was felt that the patient's acute on chronic renal failure
was secondary to a large component of prerenal hypovolemia as
well as renal tubular acidosis type IV.

The patient was started on sodium bicarbonate 650 mg twice a
day, and was given IV fluid hydration including normal saline
with bicarbonate.  The patient's creatinine responded well to
IV hydration and holding of nephrotoxic medications and on
the day of discharge, his creatinine had returned to his
baseline at 1.5.  The patient will continue to take sodium
bicarbonate as an outpatient.  He will also be taking his
daily ACE inhibitor and daily Allopurinol.  He will not take
his colchicine unless he has an acute flare of gout.

4. Diabetes mellitus:  The patient was continued on his fixed
doses of NPH, and was placed on an insulin-sliding scale.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Please follow up with your primary
care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] within 1-2 weeks.  Please follow
up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as previously scheduled, [**8-17**].  Please have your INR checked in 3-4 days as Coumadin
dose may need to be adjusted.  Your goal INR should be
between [**1-2**].  Please have the results called to your primary
care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Seventy-seven year old male with coronary artery disease.
     
     SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB:
     Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142  
     mg/kg/min. Two minutes after the cessation of infusion, Tc-99m sestamibi was
     administered IV.  The patient was transferred to the ED after the completion of
     the study due to chest pain.
     
     INTERPRETATION: 
     
     Image Protocol: Gated SPECT.
     
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium-201.
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.
     
     Stress images show a moderately dilated LV cavity, which improves but does not
     normalize with rest. The right ventricle also appears prominent.
     
     There is a a large area involving the entire inferior wall from base to apex
     with moderate reduction of photon counts. At rest, there is almost complete 
     normalization of this abnormality.
     
     There is a second medium size area involving the anteroapical and apical
     regions, with 
     moderate reduction in counts at stress. Rest SPECT images show almost complete
     reversibility of this abnormality.
     
     Finally, there is a third medium size area at the basal portion of the lateral,
     anterolateral and inferolateral walls with moderate reduction in photon counts
     at both stress and rest, without significant reversibility.
     
      Gated SPECT images demonstrate severe systolic dysfunction with severe global
     hypokinesis and septal akinesis (post CABG). The left ventricular ejection
     fraction calculated from gated SPECT images obtained after exercise is 19%.
     There appears to be mild right ventricular dysfunction.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Strongly positive pharmacologic myocardial perfusion study.
     Transient ischemic dilatation with evidence of extensive ischemia in at least
     two coronary vascular distributions (left anterior descending and right coronary
     arteries), and evidence of previous infarction in the distribution of the left
     circumflex coronary artery.  Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF
     of 19%).  These findings were discussed with the ordering physician as well as
     the ED at the time of the exam.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Seventy-seven year old male with known coronary artery disease, s/p  
     stent.
     
     SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB:
     Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142
     mg/kg/min. Two minutes after the cessation of infusion, Tc-99m sestamibi was
     administered IV.
     
     INTERPRETATION: 
     
     Image Protocol: Gated SPECT.
     
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium-201.
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.
     
     Stress images show a transient ischemic dilatation of the left ventricle.  There
     is a mild defect involving the apex.  There is also a mild defect involving the
     base of the lateral wall.
     
     Resting perfusion images show the same above described defects.  There is no
     reversibility.
     
     Ejection fraction calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after
     Dipyridamole administration is 19%.  There is moderately severe global
     hypokinesia.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Abnormal pharmacologic stress test.  There are mild, fixed defects
     involving apex and base of the lateral wall.  There is moderately severe global
     hypokinesia with an EF of 19%.  There is transient ischemic dilatation.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Shortness of breath.
     
     VIEWS:  Erect AP view compared with upright AP view from [**2569-7-20**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Again seen is an ICD device with pacing leads in stable and
     satisfactory positions.  An abandoned pacer lead is again identified leading
     into the right upper chest.  The patient is S/P median sternotomy and CABG.
     There is stable cardiac enlargement. The mediastinal contour is unchanged.
     The pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits.  The lungs appear clear
     without evidence of focal consolidation.  No definite pleural effusions are
     identified.  There is no pneumothorax.  The osseous and soft tissue structures
     remain stable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Stable cardiomegaly without evidence of congestive heart failure
     or pneumonia.

     HISTORY:  Seventy-seven year old man with h/o CAD, s/p CABG, with multiple  
     stents in 8/03, who presents with dyspnea.
     
     SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB:
     Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142
     mg/kg/min. Two minutes after the cessation of infusion, Tc-99m sestamibi was
     administered IV.  The patient had progressive anginal symptoms reaching in
     intensity of 7/10 at peak.  The ECG was uninterpretable, secondary to baseline
     abnormalities.
     
     INTERPRETATION: 
     
     Image Protocol: Gated SPECT.
     
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium-201.
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.
     
     Stress images show a moderate perfusion defect of the apex and a moderate
     perfusion defect of the lateral wall.  Both of these defects are partially
     reversible on resting perfusion images.  There is a decrease in counts in the
     inferior wall that is perhaps related to ischemia, but attenuation correction
     resolves this defect so diaphragmatic attenuation may be the cause of this
     defect.
     
     In comparison to the prior study, the defects are more reversible.  
     
     Ejection fraction calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after
     Dipyridamole administration is 14%, with severe global hypokinesis.  The left
     ventricular cavity is severely dilated. 
     
     IMPRESSION:  1) Moderate, partially reversible apical defect.  2) Moderate,
     partially reversible lateral wall defect.  3) Partial reversibility of the
     inferior wall that may be related to diaphragmatic attenuation.  4) Severe
     global hypokinesis with ejection fraction 14%.
     
     Findings were conveyed to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3665**], at the time of interpretation.

Briefly this is a 79yo M with multiple medical problems including ESRD, CAD, s/p CABG [**2547**], ishemic cardiomyopathy with EF ~15%, DM 2, AF --> pacer/AICD, gout, Fe deficient anemia & B12 deficiency, who was admitted to [**Hospital1 10**]-[**Location (un) **] on [**7-31**] for CC: constipation. In course of admission pt developed suspected SIRS becoming hypotensive requiring pressors and volume resuscitation, Bld Cx were + [**3-4**] GPC and further speciated MRSA. Pt has had ESRD for some time and during this admission was evaluated for HD. Pt was pressor dependent at the time of eval and it was suggested that CVVHDF may be a better option. Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 10**] for renal evaluation and possible HD vs. CVVHDF.
Please see admission assessment and flowsheet for full assessment.
