80M CAD s/p CABG [**3136**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to RCA, SVG to LCX), 
ischemic CM/CHF with EF 35%, chronic afib (on coumadin) s/p PPM 
(infected wire 1992, revised and reinserted on left in [**3138**]), 
initially admitted to OSH [**12-14**] for LLL PNA, treated with 
levofloxacin.  He was readmitted [**1-14**] with ? cellulitis RUE 
related to IV site and found to have MSSA bacteremia, treated 
with IV PCN x 4 weeks.   He did well until [**3150-4-23**] when he 
developed F/C at home.  Outpt Blood Cx + for MSSA --> admitted 
to OSH for IV ceftriaxone, zosyn and levofloxacin.  Few days 
later changed to nafcillin and then PCN.  He continues to have 
positive blood cultures despite treatment.  TEE report from 
[**3150-4-27**] showed increased echogenicity on 2 pacer wires without 
vegetations, EF 35%.  
 He was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] [**3150-5-2**] for persistent staph aureus 
bacteremia after receiving IV abx since readmission on [**3150-4-21**], 
concern for PPM infection, and acute renal failure occurring 
while receiving abx at OSH.
  In CCU, patient remained hemodynamically stable.  ID, Renal,

dual-pacer, s/p CAB

Renal U/S [**3150-5-3**]: no hydro, no stones, no masses in kidneys, 
prostate enlarged, small echogenic kidneys
 
Brief Hospital Course:
1) MSSA Bacteremia: Patient received Nafcillin and PCN at OSH 
and last + BCx was [**4-28**]. He then developed ARF likely [**1-11**] AIN 
(white cell casts seen in urine despite lack of urine 
eosonophils). He was then switched to vancomycin and placed on 
prednisone. EP was planning on removing pacer wires at a later 
time. In the setting of his renal failure, his lasix, ACEI and 
allopurinol were held.  

*  
2) CARDIAC:  
.  
A) CAD: s/p CABG in [**3136**]. No evidence of ischemia on EKG. 
Continued ASA, statin, BB (holding ACE-I [**1-11**] ARF).   Patient had 
a h/o CHF: EF 35%. No evidence of failure on admission. Pt takes 
lasix 80mg QOD even days, 40mg QOD odd days as OP.  Held and 
ace. He was started on low dose BB, titrate up as tolerated  
.  
C) Atrial fibrillation: History of chronic afib. OP Coumadin 
dose 1.25mg M-Sat; 2.5mg QSun.  INR 21 on admission, 12 today. 
He was then given some vitamin K
*  
3) COPD: No evidence of exacerbation.  
--Continued on atrovent, albuterol PRN  

Patient was doing much better, until he developed the acute 
onset of SOB requiring intubation and transfer to MICU. Given 
his h/o of PE, there was concern for repeat PE. Given his renal 
failure, CTA was difficult and given his COPD, a V/Q scan was 
not feasible as well. He was started on heparin drip. He also 
became hypotensive refractory to triple pressor support. An echo 
was done which showed a severe EF depression (less than 10%) 
with RV dilation and seevre global RV hypokinesis.  EKG has no 
ischemic changes and first set of enzymes was negative. Concern 
was still for a massive PE and there was a question as to 
whether lytics sould be started. However, patient was oozing 
blood from his line site and decision was to only start lytics 
if a PE was definite. He was too unstable to go for CTA, and 
decison was to take the patient to cath to better define his HD. 
 He continued to clinically decline and was started on broad 
spectrum abx, including vanco, levo, [**Doctor Last Name **] gent.  A pulmonary 
angiogram was done, and showed no evidence of PE.  In addition, 
his blood cultures grew [**3-13**] gram negative rods, and patient 
continued  to decline clinially and seemed in septic shock with 
limited cardaic reserve. His family was contacted and the case 
was discussed. Patient passed away shortly thereafter. 
 
Medications on Admission:
(On admission to [**Hospital3 **]): Lisinopril 20mg daily, Lanoxin 
0.25mg daily, Lasix 80mg QOD, Allopurinol 200mg daily, Ecotrin 
81mg daily, Coumadin (dose not listed), Omeprazole 20mg daily,

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CHEST AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW.
     
     INDICATION:  History of ___infection, persistent bacteremia.  Evaluate for
     infiltrates.
     
     FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in upright
     position demonstrates status post sternotomy and the presence of multiple
     surgical clips in the left-sided mediastinum are indicative of previous bypass
     surgery.  A permanent pacer is located in anterior axillary position connected
     to two intracavitary electrodes both terminating in a position compatible with
     the apical portion of the right ventricle.  Should one of the electrodes be
     aiming for the coronary sinus and left-sided ventricular pacing, a lateral
     view should be obtained to differentiate appropriate position.
       
     The heart is not significantly enlarged and no typical configurational
     abnormality is present.  The thoracic aorta is unremarkable for age and
     demonstrates some linear calcifications in the wall of the aorta.
     
     The pulmonary vasculature is not congested and no acute parenchymal
     infiltrates can be identified.  The low positioned and somewhat flattened
     diaphragms are suggestive of some COPD.
     
     There exist no prior chest examination on our records available for
     comparison.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Status post bypass surgery, dual electrode pacer, no evidence of
     CHF or acute infiltrates.

     COMPARISON:  Study from [**3150-5-9**].  03:09.
     
     FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of an ET tube, with the tip
     positioned approximately 3 cm above the carina.  There has been interval
     development of right perihilar opacity in comparison to prior study done
     approximately one hour prior, which suggests that this is related to
     aspiration.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  A
     pacemaker is seen overlying the left hemithorax.  An NG tube is seen extending
     into the stomach.  There is a small left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is
     seen.  Soft tissue and osseous structures are unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Interval intubation, with the tube approximately 3 cm above the
     carina.  There is a new right hilar opacity, which likely represents
     aspiration.

     Admitting Diagnosis: PACER LEAD INFECTION
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
        80 year old man with history of PPM infection, persistent bacteremia. Sudden 
      hypoxia/respiratory failure, s/p intubation with poor oxygenation           
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      pls check ET tube placement

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  History of persistent bacteremia, status post intubation ,
     evaluate ET tube placement.
     
     COMPARISON:  Study from [**3150-5-9**].  03:09.
     
     FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of an ET tube, with the tip
     positioned approximately 3 cm above the carina.  There has been interval
     development of right perihilar opacity in comparison to prior study done
     approximately one hour prior, which suggests that this is related to
     aspiration.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  A
     pacemaker is seen overlying the left hemithorax.  An NG tube is seen extending
     into the stomach.  There is a small left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is
     seen.  Soft tissue and osseous structures are unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Interval intubation, with the tube approximately 3 cm above the
     carina.  There is a new right hilar opacity, which likely represents
     aspiration.
