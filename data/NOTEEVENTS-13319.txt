Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 347**] 
Chief Complaint:
post operative ST elevation myocardial infarction
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
 
History of Present Illness:
78 year old female with history of hypertension, 
hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease with past 
angioplasty x2, congestive heart failure, paroxysmal atrial 
fibrillation, s/p aortic valve replacement and mitral valve 
repair for rheumatic disease, who presented initially to [**Hospital1 4104**] on [**4-30**] for infected artificial knee 
hardware and sepsis. After undergoing resection arthroplasty 
[**5-3**] the patient was transferred to the ICU, where she became 
hypotensive (SBP 48) with 3mm ST elevations seen in inferoseptal 
leads on ECG. CK was elevated >1600 and Troponin T was >50. 
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for urgent cardiac 
catheterization. Levophed and dopamine infusions were started 
and the patient was intubated upon arrival. In catheterization, 
one drug eluting stent was applied to a 80% occluding right 
coronary artery lesion without residual flow defect. The patient 
became hypotensive and developed ventricular tachycardia during 
the procedure requiring addition of a lidocaine infusion, 
maximal levophed and dopamine delivery, and balloon pump 
placement. She was transferred to the CCU for further management 
since her cardiac output was low at 1.8 (CI 1.2 PCWP 18) and she 
continued to be hypotensive. Of note, echocardiogram on [**2532-4-22**] 
showed dilated LV, severe pulm HTN 70mmHg, moderate MR, mild TR, 
LVH, and normally functioning porcine AV.  Ejection fraction was 
normal and no wall motion abnormalities were seen. 
 
Past Medical History:
coronary artery disease with past angioplasty x2, congestive 
heart failure, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, s/p aortic valve 
replacement and mitral valve repair for rheumatic disease, 
chronic renal insufficiency and acute renal failure, paroxysmal 
atrial fibrillation (retroperitoneal bleed on coumadin [**10-21**]), 
chronic anemia, COPD, rheumatoid arthritis, lacunar infarct, 
cortical atrophy, facial droop, peptic ulcer disease [**2-20**] NSAIDS, 
diverticulosis, short bowel syndrome, neuropathy, recurrent 
UTI/pyelonephritis caused by Serratia and Klebsiella, s/p 
colectomy 2003 for bowel ischemia, s/p ileostomy for recurrent 
lower GI bleeding, s/p bilateral total knee replacement c/b 
recurrent infection of the right knee (s/p incision and drainage 
[**5-21**] for infection with klebsiella, proteus, e.coli), 
degenerative disc diasease, s/p appendectomy, s/p 
cholecystectomy, s/p hysterectomy, s/p tracheostomy 
 
Social History:
home health services living with daughter [**Name (NI) 740**] 
 
Family History:
father and brother died of MI 
 
Physical Exam:
The patient was unresponsive and found to be breathless, 
pulseless, and without heart tones, blood pressure, and corneal 
reflexes.  The patient was pronounced dead at 0515  on [**2532-5-4**].  
The patient's private physician and family were notified.  They 
refused anatomic gifts and autopsy.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 year old female with multiple medical problems who developed 
an acute myocardial infarction after orthopedic surgery at [**Hospital1 4104**]. 
.
Cardiovascular-She had known coronary disease with prior 
angioplasties as well as atrial fibrillation and valvular 
disease. At the OSH, the patient became hypotensive with signs 
of inferoseptal myocardial infarction on ECG. At [**Hospital1 19**], the 
patient received one stent that fully opened an 80% lesion in 
the proximal right coronary artery. No flow limiting disease was 
seen in in the LCX or LAD.  However, the patient developed 
hypotension and required intubation plus pressure support with 
monitoring in the ICU. In spite of aggressive care on levophed, 
dobutamine, vasopressin, and lidocaine; the patient became 
increasingly bradycardic and expired approximately 6 hours after 
admission to [**Hospital1 19**]. She was given plavix and aggrastat. Calcium 
and electrolytes were repleted. 
.  
Pulmonary-Intubated for airway protection. Fentanyl and versed 
infusions for sedation. She developed lactic acidosis (lactate 
7.9) with respiratory compensation. Bicarbonate supplementation 
was given without significant improvement.  
.  
Renal- At baseline Cr 1.4. Medications were renally dosed. 
.  
Musculoskeletal- The patient was status post right knee 
resection arthroplasty with drain in place for recurrent right 
knee prosthetic infections. Fluid analysis identified many PMNs 
but no organism on gram stain. Preliminary cultures grew gram 
negative rods resembling Serratia. It was sensitive to 
ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, 
imipenem, levoquin, bactrim, and augmentin. Resistant to 
ampicillin, piperacilliin, tetracycline, and cefazolin. 
Infectious disease consultation at the OSH had started 
ceftriaxone 2g IV and vancomycin 650mg IV daily, which was 
continued at [**Hospital1 19**]. The patient did not have fever but developed 
a post MI leukocytosis.
.  
GI-Iliostomy care.   
.  
FEN: NPO, albumin at OSH 2.9, hypocalcemia cCa 7.9/free Ca 
1.08(Ca 9.6->7), hypomagnesemia. Repleted Ca and Mg. 
Supplemented sodium bicarbonate for acidosis.  
.  
MRSA  and aspiration precautions.
.  
Access: Femoral line and left portacath in place. Left radial 
arterial line placed at [**Hospital1 19**]. 
.  
Code: Full
