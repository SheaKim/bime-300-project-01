P: current plan is to repeat ECHO Thursday to assess for tamponade. 
Will continue weaning attempts for now. Pt had expressed to both PCP and her son n the past that she would not want to live in a NH, and would not want chronic mechanical ventilation. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1193**] asked pt today if she wanted the breathing tube removed, even if it was unlikely that she would survive, and she seemed to indicate that she would want it out (though difficult to really be sure, since pt is HOH and unable to speak to ask questions and validate her understanding). In that light, if pt is able to make some progress towards weaning by the end of the week, we will plan to trach her on Friday and proceed to vent rehab placement. If she is unable to make any progress, we will further discuss option of extubating pt and re-focus on comfort care. Covering case manager, [**Known patient firstname 1934**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], aware of status and is beginning rehab screening process.

NPN 7A-7P: 
NEURO: Pt generally calm all day, sleeping in naps. Can be very sleepy at times after periods of activity or weaning, which tend to tire her out. MAE with purpose. No agitation noted today. Did pull vent tubing off trach a few times, but seemed to be a mistake (she needed her mouth suctioned and thought she had the Yankaur, apparently). Pt interactive and smiling at times, more withdrawn at other times. OOB to chair for 5 hours today, well-tolerated. Able to take a few steps with assist of 2, and pivot into chair and bed. 
RESP: Weaned to PS of 12, with PEEP 7.5, FiO2 .40 today. Tolerated for 7 hours, then became tachypneic (RR 40's), restless. Did not resolve with rest, so placed back on PS of 15 with good results. RR returned to high 20's-30's and pt has been much more comfortable. Sats have generally been high 90's, though she can drop to high 80's when she needs to be suctioned. LS coarse t/o.

C-V: Hydralazine D/C'd as possible contributor to fever (increase correlates with increased dose). BP has been 120's-140's all day with increase in Lopressor and addition of Lisinopril. HR 60's-80's, NSR with no ectopy. 
F/E: Little response to standing dose of Lasix this AM; given additional 120mg Lasix at 3PM also with little respose. HO aware; no new orders. TFB remains positive. 24-hour urine sent at 1600 as ordered.
