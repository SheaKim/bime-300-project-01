     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      225 pound 54 year old female patient with ovarian cancer.                       
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Evaluate disease.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     Ovarian cancer.
     
     COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated [**2616-8-1**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Oral contrast was administered.  Sequential transverse images were
     acquired through the abdomen and pelvis prior to the administration of
     intravenous contrast.  Additional reconstructed stacked 5 mm axial sections.
     Following the uneventful administration of 100 mL of Optiray 350 intravenous
     contrast material, sequential images were acquired from the thoracic inlet
     through the pelvis and reconstructed in 5 mm stacked axial images.  Three
     minute delayed images were acquired through the kidneys per protocol.  Coronal
     and sagittal multiplanar reformatted images were generated.  Finally, coronal
     maximal intensity projection reformatted images were also generated.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  No hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy is noted.
     Again, seen are stable scattered nodes through the mediastinum.  From cephalad
     to caudad, there is an 8 mm x 4 mm right paratracheal (station 2R) lymph node
     on series 4 image #10.  There is a 6 mm x 9 mm right peritracheal lymph node
     (station 2R) on series 4, image #12.  There is a 7 mm x 19 mm lymph node with
     fatty hilum in the right paratracheal region (station 4Rs) on series 4, image
     #21.  The AP window (station 6) is also stable at approximately 7 mm x 10 mm.
     There is mediastinal lipomatosis again appreciated.  There is no pneumo-
     mediastinum.  The esophagus images normally.  The heart size remains normal.
     There is mild pericardial thickening noted at the apex.  No effusion is seen.
     Scattered cardiophrenic lymph nodes and paraesophageal lymph nodes at the
     esophageal hiatus also again noted and stable.  Stable lung nodules are again
     identified over the right hemidiaphragm dome on series 4, image #45 and in the
     superior segment of the left lower lobe, series 4, image #32.  Minimal
     scattered atelectasis is seen in the right lung base.  There is no effusion or
     pneumothorax evident.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver is
     again identified.  A gallstone is again identified in the gallbladder neck.
     Mild pericholecystic stranding is again identified, although relatively
     stable.  No overt wall thickening is seen.  There is differential attenuation
     within the gallbladder lumen suggestive of sludge.  The right kidney remains
     malrotated.  Scattered low attenuation lesions throughout the kidney are again
     noted and stable.  The lesions in the upper pole and the medial lip of the mid
     left kidney meet CT criteria for simple cysts.  The other lesions are too
     small to further characterize.  There is a stable low attenuation lesion in
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     the spleen at the hilum.
     
     The stomach is distended with contrast. Contrast is noted in the more distal
     small bowel.  There is no evidence of small bowel wall dilatation or other
     evidence of obstruction.  Extensive soft tissue foci are noted throughout the
     omentum, particularly at the level splenic flexure consistent with omental
     metastatic implants.  Previously noted mesenteric implants versus metastatic
     lymph nodes are also identified.  The mass lesions in the distribution of the
     ileocolic region are again noted and are grossly stable within best achievable
     quantitative measurements.  There is again seen marked redundancy of the
     sigmoid colon.  Scattered stool and gas is seen.  No free abdominal fluid or
     air is seen.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The previously noted ill-defined region of soft
     tissue attenuation with associated tethering of the redundant sigmoid colon is
     again seen and stable.  Comparable measurements are again stable within
     limitations.  The bladder is distended with no focal wall thickening.  The
     uterus is surgically absent.  Ovaries are not identified and presumed resected
     given history.  No free fluid is noted in the pelvis.  No pelvic
     lymphadenopathy is evident.
     
     OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No suspicious blastic or lytic lesions are identified.
     Spinal alignment is preserved.  Mild diffuse spondylotic changes noted at
     multiple levels.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Overall, stable CT appearance of previously described peritoneal
     carcinomatosis, splenic flexure and bowel wall thickening, low attenuation
     splenic lesion, and isolated pulmonary nodules at the bilateral lung bases. No
     ascites or other acute interval change.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST

Reason: CT with RECTAL contrast to rule out distal obstructive 
proce
Field of view: 46 Contrast: OPTIRAY

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
54F with large bowel obstruction 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
CT with RECTAL contrast to rule out distal obstructive process 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: IV dye allergy

INDICATION: Plain film concerning for large bowel obstruction.

COMPARISON: CT scan dated [**2616-11-21**] and plain films dated 
[**2616-12-12**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired images of the abdomen and pelvis were 
obtained after the administration of IV, oral, and rectal 
contrast. Multiplanar reformatted images were also obtained.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST
The imaged portions of the lung bases are clear. There is 
diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver. There is a gallstone 
within the gallbladder. The pancreas and spleen are 
unremarkable. The adrenal glands are normal. There are multiple 
left renal cysts and a right renal lesion that is too small to 
characterize, that probably represents a cyst.

There is dilatation of the cecum with diameter measuring up to 
12.3 cm. Oral contrast is present within the cecum. No dilated 
loops of small bowel are seen. Note is made of subtle 
pneumatosis of the cecum with no wall edema. The transverse 
colon measures up to 7.8 cm, only mildly dilated by size 
criteria with no wall edema or pneumatosis. There is a focal 
narrowing of the lumen of the sigmoid flexure with adjacent 
peritoneal metastasis producing a low-grade obstruction at this 
location. The descending colon is of normal size. There is an 
inflammatory mass located at the mid-upper pelvis (series 5, 
image 69). Rectal contrast material passes freely through the 
rectum and sigmoid colon to the level of this inflammatory mass 
(series 7, image 24). Approximately 1 liter of contrast was 
given. There is no intra-abdominal free air. There is no 
mesenteric or portal venous gas. The superior mesenteric artery, 
celiac artery, and inferior mesenteric arteries all appear 
patent.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The bladder is unremarkable. 
The patient is status post TAHBSO. There is no pelvic free 
fluid. Rectum is unremarkable with rectal tube in place.

Bone windows reveal no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. 
There are degenerative changes.

IMPRESSION:
1) Dilatation of the cecum with measurement up to 12.3 cm, and 
only mild dilatation of the transverse colon, with the 
descending colon being of normal diameter. There is a focal area 
of mild luminal narrowing at the splenic flexure with adjacent 
mesenteric/serosal metastasis. More inferiorly, in the mid 
pelvis there is an ill-defined mesenteric metastatic lesion, 
with rectal contrast noted to clearly pass from the rectum 
through the sigmoid colon up to the level of this mass. No 
rectal contrast could be passed through this level. Notably, 
there is residual stool present within the rectum and sigmoid 
colon. Taken together, findings are suggestive of at least a 
partial large bowel obstruction. Complete or high-grade 
obstruction cannot be excluded as rectal contrast material was 
not noted to pass through the level of this inflammatory mass. 
Further evaluation could be performed with a barium enema to 
assess for passage of contrast through this level.

2) Pneumatosis is noted of the cecum, without associated wall 
edema. The significance of this finding is not certain. It is 
not felt to be likely due to ischemia. Correlate clinically.

KUB
-------
Compared to CT torso of [**2616-11-21**]. There is diffuse distention of 
the large bowel to the level of the distal sigmoid colon, at 
which point there appears to be an abrupt cut off which 
corresponds to an area of serosal implant seen on the prior CT 
of [**2616-11-21**]. Overall, the findings are highly concerning for 
distal large bowel obstruction. The large bowel measures up to 
10 cm in maximum diameter involving the transverse and hepatic 
flexure. No evidence of free intraperitoneal air.

IMPRESSION: Findings highly suspicious for distal large bowel 
obstruction. Findings discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1772**] after the 
study.

INTERPRETATION:  
      
Findings:  
  
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.  
  
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.  
  
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and 
systolic function  
(LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion 
abnormality  
cannot be fully excluded. No resting LVOT gradient.  
  
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.  
  
AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta 
diameter.  
  
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets. No AR.  
  
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. [**Last Name (Titles) 1582**].  
  
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial 
TR. Borderline  
PA systolic hypertension.  
  
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets 
with  
physiologic PR.  
  
PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely 
represents a fat  
pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be 
excluded.  
  
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views. 
Suboptimal  
image quality - bandages, defibrillator pads or electrodes. 
Suboptimal image  
quality - body habitus.  
   
Conclusions:  
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity  
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to 
suboptimal technical  
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully 
excluded. Right  
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve  
leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. 
No aortic  
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with  
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. 
There is  
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a 
prominent  
anterior fat pad.  
  
IMPRESSION: Preserved global and regional biventricular systolic 
function.  
  
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:  
Based on 1997 AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the 
echo findings  
indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not recommended). Clinical 
decisions  
regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical 
and  
echocardiographic data.  
 
Chest Xray
--------------
Admission [**2616-12-13**]
Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2616-3-24**]. The 
heart size is mildly enlarged but stable. The mediastinal 
contours are unchanged. The lungs are clear. There is no 
sizeable pleural effusion. The left subclavian line tip is in 
mid SVC.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.

[**2616-12-22**] Chest Xray
FINDINGS: Compared with [**2616-12-14**], there has been partial interval 
clearing of the left lower lobe atelectasis/infiltrate/effusion. 
No infiltrates are seen in the left mid/upper and right lung 
fields.

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known patient firstname **] [**Known patient lastname **] was admitted to the surgery service under the care 
of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2616-12-12**].  CT scan and KUB showed evidence of 
large bowel obstruction. She was taken to the operating room on 
HD 1 where she underwent an exploratory laparotomy, abdominal 
colectomy, sigmoid mucous fistula and ileostomy,  transgastric
gastrojejunostomy, tube placement and splenic flexure takedown. 
She was transferred to the ICU intubated postoperatively.  At 
POD 1 she was tachycardic and with low urine output. She was 
treated with fluid resuscitation and 1 unit PRBCs. She was on 
day 2 of Kefzol/Flagyl. 

At POD 2 she was extubated. Urine output was improved and she 
was afebrile. Her antibiotics were discontinued. Hct was stable 
at 29.6.  Tube feeds were started at jejunostomy. Lasix was 
started for diuresis. Blood glucose was evaluated and treated 
with RSSI. 

At POD 3 an ECHO was performed which was WNL with LVEF>55%. She 
was transferred to the floor. Blood pressure was elevated and 
continued to be controlled with IV metoprolol.

At POD 4 tube feedings continued with reports of high residuals. 
 A KUB was completed without evidence of obstruction. NGT 
remained in place. Blood pressure was elevated. Diuresis 
continued. Physical therapy was consulted. 

At POD 5 there was return of bowel function.  NGT was removed. 
Diet was advanced to sips. She was febrile to 101.4 Urinalysis 
was negative. Urine and blood cultures were sent. RIJ was 
removed and tip sent for culture. CXR was negative.

At POD 6 she complained of nausea. Reglan was started and her 
diet was advanced as tolerated. She was started on PO 
medications. 

At POD 7 she had high ostomy output. C. difficile was sent and 
was negative. Fluid placement was provided to accommodate 
output. Tube feeds were held to decrease output. She was 
afebrile.

At POD 8 the ostomy output continued to be high at >4000cc.  
Imodium and Metamucil were started. IV fluids were provided to 
accommodate output.  Blood, urine and line tip cultures from 
POD5 were negative. Tube feeds were restarted.

At POD 11 she was doing well. Ostomy output remained high at 
1575cc but was certainly improved from initial post operative 
bowel function recovery.  Metamucil and Imodium d[**MD Number 8441**] was 
increased. The tube feeds were at goal at 60cc/hr. She was 
discharged in good condition to an acute rehabilitation center.  
She was to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in clinic in 1-2 weeks.

     COMPARISON:  CT scan dated [**2616-11-21**] and plain films dated [**2616-12-12**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained after
     the administration of IV, oral, and rectal contrast.  Multiplanar reformatted
     images were also obtained.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The imaged portions of the lung bases are
     clear.  There is diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver.  There is a
     gallstone within the gallbladder.  The pancreas and spleen are unremarkable.
     The adrenal glands are normal.  There are multiple left renal cysts and a
     right renal lesion that is too small to characterize, that probably represents
     a cyst.
     
     There is dilatation of the cecum with diameter measuring up to 12.3 cm.  Oral
     contrast is present within the cecum.  No dilated loops of small bowel are
     seen.  Note is made of subtle pneumatosis of the cecum with no wall edema. The
     transverse colon measures up to 7.8 cm, only mildly dilated by size criteria
     with no wall edema or pneumatosis.  There is a focal narrowing of the lumen of
     the sigmoid flexure with adjacent peritoneal metastasis producing a low-grade
     obstruction at this location.  The descending colon is of normal size.  There
     is an inflammatory mass located at the mid-upper pelvis (series 5, image 69).
     Rectal contrast material passes freely through the rectum and sigmoid colon to
     the level of this inflammatory mass (series 7, image 24). Approximately 1
     liter of contrast was given.  There is no intra-abdominal free air.  There is
     no mesenteric or portal venous gas.  The superior mesenteric artery, celiac
     artery, and inferior mesenteric arteries all appear patent.

     INDICATION:  54-year-old female with ovarian cancer.
     
     Comparison is made to prior CT torso done on [**2616-11-21**] and [**2616-12-12**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained from thoracic inlet to pubic
     symphysis.  100 cc of Optiray was injected intravenously.  Oral contrast was
     also used.  Sagittal and coronal reformatted images were obtained.
     
     CT OF CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  No hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy noted. Stable
     shotty mediastinal lymphadenopathy is again noted and is unchanged in size and
     appearance.  No new lymph node is identified.  There is no pleural effusion
     and parenchymal consolidation.  Stable lung nodules are again identified over
     the right hemidiaphragm dome and in the superior segment of left lower lobe.
     The heart, precardium, and great vessels are unremarkable.  
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  Diffuse fatty infiltration of liver is again noted.
     A gallstone is again identified in the gallbladder neck with no evidence of
     cholecystitis.  The adrenal glands and small bowel loops are unremarkable.
     Bilateral low-attenuation lesions seen within both kidneys are unchanged.
     Lesions are too small to characterize.  There is a stable low-attenuation
     lesion in the spleen at the hilum.
     
     Patient is status post total colectomy.  There is no evidence of small bowel
     wall dilatation or other evidence of obstruction.  Two defects are seen within
     the lower part of abdomen and most likely represent sites of previous
     ileostomy.  Extensive increased soft tissue densities are noted throughout the
     omentum.
     
     Although assigning target lesions  for peritoneal metastases is  not
     appropriate, the following prominant areas were marked.
     
     Lesion #1 is located on series 3, image 77 and measures 27 x 50 mm.
     
     The second peritoneal metastatic lesion is best seen on series 3, image 99 and
     measures 35 x 31 cm.
     
     The third peritoneal lesion is seen within the lesser sac and measures 22 x 59
     mm and is best seen on series 3, image 64.
     
     Other than these obvious mass lesions, there are multiple small foci of
                                                                 (Over)

     COMPARISON:  CT torso [**2617-1-23**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired contiguous axial images from the lung apices to
     pubic symphysis were acquired following administration of oral and 130 cc of
     IV Optiray.  Non-ionic contrast was administered secondary to protocol. Non-
     contrast images of the abdomen and three-minute delayed contrast-enhanced
     images of the kidneys were obtained.  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions
     were performed.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Multiple small mediastinal lymph
     nodes within the prevascular, right lower paratracheal, and left lower
     paratracheal space measuring up to 9 mm are not changed in the interval. There
     is no hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy.  The heart, pericardium, and great
     vessels are within normal limits.  No pleural effusion.
     
     Lung window images again demonstrate at extreme lung bases, stable bilateral
     pleural-based nodules.  No new pulmonary nodules are noted. Multiple
     diaphragmatic lymph nodes are also seen measuring up to 9 mm in size, and are
     unchanged.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Nodular enhancement
     along the capsule of the liver particularly along the right lateral aspect is
     consistent with capsular implants, and unchanged from the previous
     examination.  Ill-defined peritoneal soft tissue and mesenteric nodules are
     again noted with a small amount of fluid consistent with peritoneal and
     mesenteric metastatic disease.  Please note that the mesenteric soft tissue
     nodules cannot be differentiated from mesenteric lymph nodes.  Overall, the
     extent of peritoneal and mesenteric disease is unchanged in the interval;
     please see the following oncology table before measurements.  There is diffuse
     fatty infiltration of the liver, but no focal parenchymal lesions are
     otherwise identified.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct
     dilatation.  A small calcified [**Known patient lastname 12406**] is identified within the neck of the
     gallbladder, unchanged.  The gallbladder is otherwise unremarkable.  There is
     no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation.  Pancreas, adrenal glands,
     stomach are unremarkable. The small- bowel loops appear to be somewhat
     tethered to the periphery, unchanged. Multiple small cysts are seen within
     both kidneys.  1- mm non- obstructing left renal calculus is unchanged.
     Kidneys otherwise appear unremarkable.  No evidence of hydronephrosis or new
     solid lesions are seen within the kidneys. Again demonstrated within the

     COMPARISON:  CT torso [**2617-1-23**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired contiguous axial images from the lung apices to
     pubic symphysis were acquired following administration of oral and 130 cc of
     IV Optiray.  Non-ionic contrast was administered secondary to protocol. Non-
     contrast images of the abdomen and three-minute delayed contrast-enhanced
     images of the kidneys were obtained.  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions
     were performed.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Multiple small mediastinal lymph
     nodes within the prevascular, right lower paratracheal, and left lower
     paratracheal space measuring up to 9 mm are not changed in the interval. There
     is no hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy.  The heart, pericardium, and great
     vessels are within normal limits.  No pleural effusion.
     
     Lung window images again demonstrate at extreme lung bases, stable bilateral
     pleural-based nodules.  No new pulmonary nodules are noted. Multiple
     diaphragmatic lymph nodes are also seen measuring up to 9 mm in size, and are
     unchanged.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Nodular enhancement
     along the capsule of the liver particularly along the right lateral aspect is
     consistent with capsular implants, and unchanged from the previous
     examination.  Ill-defined peritoneal soft tissue and mesenteric nodules are
     again noted with a small amount of fluid consistent with peritoneal and
     mesenteric metastatic disease.  Please note that the mesenteric soft tissue
     nodules cannot be differentiated from mesenteric lymph nodes.  Overall, the
     extent of peritoneal and mesenteric disease is unchanged in the interval;
     please see the following oncology table before measurements.  There is diffuse
     fatty infiltration of the liver, but no focal parenchymal lesions are
     otherwise identified.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct
     dilatation.  A small calcified [**Known patient lastname 12406**] is identified within the neck of the
     gallbladder, unchanged.  The gallbladder is otherwise unremarkable.  There is
     no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation.  Pancreas, adrenal glands,
     stomach are unremarkable. The small- bowel loops appear to be somewhat
     tethered to the periphery, unchanged. Multiple small cysts are seen within
     both kidneys.  1- mm non- obstructing left renal calculus is unchanged.
     Kidneys otherwise appear unremarkable.  No evidence of hydronephrosis or new
     solid lesions are seen within the kidneys. Again demonstrated within the

     HISTORY:  54-year-old woman with ovarian cancer for restaging.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector contiguous axial images of the chest, abdomen, and
     pelvis were obtained following the administration of oral and intravenous
     contrast.  Reformatted images in coronal and sagittal planes were obtained.
     Non-contrast study of the abdomen was also performed.  The study was compared
     to a prior study of [**2617-3-7**].
     
     CT CHEST:  No lung nodules are seen.  However, there are multiple
     diaphragmatic based nodules present bilaterally.  These seem to have
     progressed since the prior study.  For example, the largest nodule on the left
     diaphragm measures 8 mm (3, 38) compared to 7 mm on the prior study and at the
     right base, within the right diaphragm, measures 15 mm (3, 41), compared to 11
     mm on the prior study.  There are no pleural effusions.  There are no
     pericardial effusions.
     
     No enlarged axillary lymph nodes are present.  There are prevascular lymph
     nodes (3, 15) measuring up to 5 mm in size, increased from 3 mm on the prior
     study.  Right paratracheal lymph node measures 10 x 21 mm (3, 15) increased
     from the prior study where it measured 9 x 20 mm.  Lymph node adjacent to the
     left main pulmonary artery (3, 19) has also increased in size, 15 x 12 mm
     compared to 11 x 7 mm on the prior study.  Seen (3, 25) adjacent to the
     pericardium on the right is a lymph node measuring 7 x 9 mm, increased from
     approximately 6 mm on the prior study.
     
     Multiple enlarged pericardial lymph nodes are present (3, 38, 39), these have
     increased in size from the prior study.  Enlarged lymph nodes at the
     gastroesophageal junction as well as at the level of the diaphragm have also
     increased in size (3, 40, and 3, 41).  Small nodes are seen in the
     gastrohepatic ligament as well.
     
     CT ABDOMEN:  Nodular enhancement along the capsule of the liver consistent
     with capsular implants has increased from the prior study. A focal hypodense
     lesion in the inferior pole of the spleen has increased in size to 19 mm (3,
     53) compared to 9 mm on the prior study.  Lesion in the superior aspect of the
     spleen (3, 43) measures 12 mm compared to 9 mm on the prior study.  Within the
     interpolar region of the spleen, the low-density lesion measuring 19 x 57 mm
     has increased to 66 x 26 mm on today's exam.
     
     Diffuse low attenuation of the liver is consistent with fatty infiltration.
     Again seen are peritoneal soft tissue and mesenteric nodules consistent with
                                                                 (Over)

     contrast.  Reformatted images in coronal and sagittal planes were obtained.
     Non-contrast study of the abdomen was also performed.  The study was compared
     to a prior study of [**2617-3-7**].
     
     CT CHEST:  No lung nodules are seen.  However, there are multiple
     diaphragmatic based nodules present bilaterally.  These seem to have
     progressed since the prior study.  For example, the largest nodule on the left
     diaphragm measures 8 mm (3, 38) compared to 7 mm on the prior study and at the
     right base, within the right diaphragm, measures 15 mm (3, 41), compared to 11
     mm on the prior study.  There are no pleural effusions.  There are no
     pericardial effusions.
     
     No enlarged axillary lymph nodes are present.  There are prevascular lymph
     nodes (3, 15) measuring up to 5 mm in size, increased from 3 mm on the prior
     study.  Right paratracheal lymph node measures 10 x 21 mm (3, 15) increased
     from the prior study where it measured 9 x 20 mm.  Lymph node adjacent to the
     left main pulmonary artery (3, 19) has also increased in size, 15 x 12 mm
     compared to 11 x 7 mm on the prior study.  Seen (3, 25) adjacent to the
     pericardium on the right is a lymph node measuring 7 x 9 mm, increased from
     approximately 6 mm on the prior study.
     
     Multiple enlarged pericardial lymph nodes are present (3, 38, 39), these have
     increased in size from the prior study.  Enlarged lymph nodes at the
     gastroesophageal junction as well as at the level of the diaphragm have also
     increased in size (3, 40, and 3, 41).  Small nodes are seen in the
     gastrohepatic ligament as well.
     
     CT ABDOMEN:  Nodular enhancement along the capsule of the liver consistent
     with capsular implants has increased from the prior study. A focal hypodense
     lesion in the inferior pole of the spleen has increased in size to 19 mm (3,
     53) compared to 9 mm on the prior study.  Lesion in the superior aspect of the
     spleen (3, 43) measures 12 mm compared to 9 mm on the prior study.  Within the
     interpolar region of the spleen, the low-density lesion measuring 19 x 57 mm
     has increased to 66 x 26 mm on today's exam.
     
     Diffuse low attenuation of the liver is consistent with fatty infiltration.
     Again seen are peritoneal soft tissue and mesenteric nodules consistent with
                                                                 (Over)

     Comparison is made to prior examination dated [**2617-4-21**].
     
     HISTORY:  54-year-old female with sudden onset of shortness of breath,
     metastatic ovarian cancer.  Evaluate for PE.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired axial images were obtained through the chest without
     and with intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformations were
     evaluated.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of aortic dissection or acute pulmonary
     embolism.  Evaluation of lung parenchyma displays no suspicious pulmonary
     nodules, however, there has been interval appearance to bilateral pleural
     effusions, small-to-moderate on the right and small on the left, as well as
     stable appearance of small pericardial effusion.  Overall, size and appearance
     of multiple mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes as measured and described on
     [**4-21**] CT are not significantly changed in size.  Periesophageal and
     cardiophrenic lymph nodes are also stable in appearance.  Airways are patent
     to the subsegmental level and heart and great vessels appear otherwise
     unremarkable.
     
     Limited examination of the upper abdomen displays no change in diaphragmatic
     and a capsular implants as well as diffuse fluid attenuation of the liver
     consistent with fatty infiltration.  Hypodense lesion in the splenic hilum is
     not as well visualized on today's study due to differences in exam technique.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified.

     STUDY:  CT torso.
     
     INDICATION:  54-year-old female with ovarian cancer.  _____.
     
     COMPARISONS:  CT torso from [**2617-4-21**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast MDCT axial images of the abdomen were acquired. 
     Following the administration of 100 cc of Optiray intravenous contrast MDCT
     axial images were acquired from the thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis. 
     Three-minute axial delayed images were acquired through the kidneys.  Coronal
     and sagittal reformatted images were then obtained.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  Compared to the previous examination there
     has been significant interval increase and large bilateral pleural effusions,
     right greater than left.  There is a new, small pericardial effusion.  There
     are multiple mediastinal nodes the largest of which measures 20 x 9 mm (3:19).
     There is another prevascular lymph node which measures 9 mm in short-axis
     dimension (3:21).  There is no other hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy. 
     Multiple lymph nodes anterior to the heart along the diaphragm and just
     anterior to the gastroesophageal junction are overall unchanged in size
     compared to the previous examination.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Nodule enhancement along the capsule of
     the liver consistent with capsular implants is stable compared to the previous
     examination.  However, there has been an increased amount of ascites which
     overall is small but is definitely new compared to the previous examination. 
     There are multiple hypodense lesions within the spleen, the largest of which
     measures 6.8 x 2.4 cm which is roughly unchanged in size compared to the
     previous examination (3:53).  Multiple cysts within both kidneys are
     unchanged.  There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  The adrenal
     glands, stomach and pancreas are overall unchanged.  Overall, the extent of
     the peritoneal and mesenteric disease appears stable compared to the previous
     examination.  The caliber of the loops of small bowel is normal.  Bilateral
     ostomy defects in the lower abdominal wall are unchanged.  There is no free
     air in the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The patient is status post colectomy.  The
     pelvic loops of small bowel are unremarkable.  The bladder is collapsed.  Once
     again, there is retained oral contrast within the rectum.  New fluid within
     the upper portion of the pelvis compared to previous examination.  The borders
     of a soft tissue implant within the right lower abdominal wall musculature are
     not as well defined as the previous examination but it measures approximately
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  Patient with pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusion with
     continued fevers.  Evaluate for worsening infiltrate or empyema.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT torso of [**2617-6-12**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the chest were obtained following
     the administration of IV Optiray contrast.  Coronal reformatted images were
     generated.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There are bilateral pleural effusions, simple
     in attenuation.  The right-sided effusion is moderate to large, mildly
     increased from the prior study.  The left effusion is small and not
     significantly changed.  A small amount of fluid is seen within the right major
     fissure, with atelectasis along the right major and the minor fissure.  There
     is no pleural thickening or enhancement to suggest an empyema.
     
     Aside from mild atelectasis adjacent to the pleural effusion and along the
     right-sided fissures, no parenchymal opacities are seen within the lungs.
     There are no lung nodules.  The central airways are patent to the subsegmental
     level bilaterally.
     
     There is a small pericardial effusion, increased slightly from the prior exam.
     The heart and great vessels are unremarkable, aside from an indwelling central
     venous catheter with tip at the cavoatrial junction.  Chunky pericardial and
     peridiaphragmatic lymph nodes are seen, some of which appear increased in size
     from [**6-12**].  One node adjacent to the diaphragm currently measures 15 x 17 mm
     (C2:49), previously measuring 13 x 14 mm.  Other mediastinal lymph nodes
     appear increased in size as well, including a previously subcentimeter right
     hilar node, currently measuring 17 x 12 mm (2:25), and a right paratracheal
     node currently measuring 22 x 11 mm (2:18) compared to 20 x 9 mm previously.
     Nodes adjacent to the gastroesophageal junction appear similar.
     
     The examination was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, but soft
     tissue enhancement along the diaphragm and liver capsule appears similar to
     the prior study, consistent with metastatic disease.  Hypodense lesions at the
     splenic hilum appear similar.  A small amount of ascites fluid is visualized.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  54-year-old with metastatic ovarian cancer presenting with fevers
     and left-sided pleuritic chest pain.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT of the chest from [**2617-7-1**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images from the thoracic inlet through the upper
     abdomen were obtained prior to and following administration of intravenous
     Optiray contrast.  Multiplanar reconstructions were performed.
     
     CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are no filling defects within
     the pulmonary arterial vasculature to indicate pulmonary embolus.  The
     thoracic aorta is normal in caliber and contour without evidence for
     dissection or aneurysmal dilatation.  There is a small pericardial effusion,
     unchanged from the prior examination.  The heart and pericardium are otherwise
     unremarkable.  The tip of an indwelling central venous catheter terminates at
     the cavoatrial junction.  Again seen are pathologically enlarged lymph nodes
     in the right paratracheal, AP window, azygoesophageal and right hilar
     stations. These appear unchanged in size in comparison with the prior study. A
     moderate right and small left pleural effusion appear slightly decreased in
     size in comparison.  Trace fluid is seen within the right minor fissure. There
     is mild dependent atelectatic change at the lung bases. The airways are patent
     to the subsegmental level bilaterally.
     
     Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen displays no change in diaphragmatic
     and capsular implants as well as diffuse low attenuation of the liver
     parenchyma consistent with fatty infiltration.  There is trace perihepatic
     ascites.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No osseous findings suspicious for malignancy are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
     2.  Slight interval decrease in a small to moderate right and small left
     pleural effusion. Stable pericardial effusion.
     3.  Stable peritoneal and mediastinal/hilar nodal involvement.

     ABDOMEN
     
     HISTORY:  Increasing abdominal distention.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP erect and supine abdomen shows central clustering of
     moderately dilated bowel loops, predominantly small bowel containing fluid
     levels.  The extent of distention is greater than it was on [**8-22**]. 
     Incidental note is made of a dilated esophagus also filled with air.
     
     Overall, the pattern suggests ascites and possible small-bowel obstruction. 
     Findings were discussed by telephone with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12428**] at the time of

     INDICATION:  54-year-old female with shortness of breath, cough and chest
     congestion.  Please evaluate for pulmonary edema versus aspiration pneumonia.
     
     FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs reviewed and compared to [**2617-8-21**].
     Please note that additional history obtained from old records indicates the
     patient also has history of ovarian cancer.
     
     Left subclavian infusion port is present, with tip at the upper cavoatrial
     junction.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is
     not enlarged.  There are new, ill-defined airspace opacities, best seen in the
     right lower lobe, but in a multifocal distribution throughout both lungs.
     Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax. Lateral
     view demonstrates a possible air-fluid level within the mid- esophagus.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  New ill-defined airspace opacities in the bilateral lower lungs, and left
     perihilar region could represent developing pneumonia, either infectious
     versus aspiration.
     2.  Unchanged small right pleural effusion.
     3.  Possible air-fluid level within the mid-esophagus, if present, would put
     the patient at risk for further aspiration.  Please correlate with formal
     swallowing evaluation, if clinically appropriate.

     HISTORY:  Upper GI bleed.  Central line placement.
     
     COMPARISON:  Earlier same day.
     
     FINDINGS:  Consistent with the given history, right internal jugular approach
     central line has been placed.  No pneumothorax is evident.  Again noted is a
     left subclavian central line, stable in course and position.  Ill-defined
     patchy opacities are noted in bilateral lower lungs as well as in the left
     perihilar region which may represent foci of aspiration or pneumonia. 
     Otherwise stable radiograph.
     
     IMPRESSION:  New right internal jugular approach central line with no
     pneumothorax.

     INDICATION:  54-year-old woman with distended abdomen, history of ovarian
     cancer.  Evaluate for obstruction, ascites, inflammation, or mass.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired axial images from the lung bases to the pubic
     symphysis were acquired without IV or oral contrast material.  Images were
     displayed with 5-mm slice thickness for review.  Multiplanar reformations were
     performed.
     
     COMPARISONS:  CTA chest of [**8-18**] and 18, 2007 and CT torso of [**2617-6-12**].
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: For a description of the findings in the chest
     plsease refer to the chest CTA performed earlier today. The distal esophagus
     is dilated and demonstrates a thickened wall. There is abnormal thickening of
     the wall of the stomach, most pronounced along the greater curvature.  The
     stomach is air- filled, but not distended. The second portion of the duodenum
     is abnormally distended with fluid and the third portion is collapsed.  Just
     proximal to the ileostomy, there is a transition point with dilated loops more
     proximally.
     
     The study is extremely limited due to absence of IV and oral contrast. Again
     noted is a lesion in the left lobe measuring at least 2.6 x 3 cm.  The
     gallbladder contains high density material, which could be vicarious contrast
     excretion and/or small layering [**Known patient lastname 12409**]. There is mild-to-moderate
     hydronephrosis on the right and hydroureter with containing contrast from the
     recent CTA. There is diffuse abdominal and pelvic stranding. There is a high
     density rim along the parietal peritoneum likely representing peritoneal
     implants. There is a small amount of ascites around the liver and pericolic
     gutters.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS:  The bladder contains a Foley catheter and contrast
     material.  The bladder wall is abnormally thickened. Again noted is a left
     sided ostomy defect.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are seen.
     
                                                                 (Over)

      No pulmonary embolism. Diffuse bilateral ground glass change and nodular
      densitis. Allowing for short interval of development, likely infectious vs
      inflammatory. Dilated fluid filled esophagus is new and aspiration is very
      likely. Stable bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion. Increase
      in size of mediastinal lymph nodes.
     ______________________________________________________________________________

     INDICATION:  Metastatic ovarian cancer and shortness breath, cough, and chest
     congestion.
     
     COMPARISON:  CTA chest, [**2617-8-18**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast and contrast-enhanced axial images of the chest are
     obtained according to the CTA protocol with multiplanar reformatted images.
     
     CTA CHEST:  There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism in the main and larger
     subsegmental pulmonary arteries with lower lung subsegmental arteries
     difficult to visualize secondary to respiratory motion. The aorta is of normal
     caliber and there is no evidence of acute aortic pathology. The heart itself
     appears unremarkable, thought there is a small pericardial effusion,
     unchanged. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are stable in size.
     Large mediastinal lymph nodes are again observed, measuring up to 13 mm in the
     peritracheal station, These appear to have progressed in size compared to
     prior when the paratracheal node measured 9 mm in short axis diameter The
     esophagus is now dilated and fluid filled with a high fluid level noted within
     the cervical esophagus.
     
     Lung windows reveal diffuse bilateral ground glass change and nodular
     opacities, which, given the short interval formation, are worrisome for
     infectious The airways are patent to the level of the subsegmental bronchi
     bilaterally.
     
     Although this exam is not tailored to evaluate abdominal organs, limited
     evaluation of the upper abdomen reveals evidence of peritoneal metastatic
     implants around the liver and free fluid, which is is incompletely evaluated.
     An approximately 4cm hypoattenuating lesion within the left lobe of the liver
     and multiple small hypoattenuating splenic lesions are incompletely evalauted.
     Prominent abdominal lymph nodes measure up to 11 mm in short axis diameter.
     
     Bone windows reveal no worrisome lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
     2.  Bilateral ground glass change and nodular opacities likely represent acute
     infection. Consider opportunistic infection based on immune status.
     Aspiration considered given #3 below, however anterior upper lobe
     involvement difficult to reconcile. Atypical edema is a less likely cause for
     these findings. Mediastinal lymph nodes have progressed in size, though a
     component of this may be reactive. 
     3.  Dilated fluid filled esophagus may represent more distal obstruction in
     the abdomen. 
     4.  Stable right greater than left pleural effusions.
     5.  Evidence of metastatic disease within the abdomen incompletely evaluated.

     weakness.  Evaluate for pneumonia/CHF.
     
     PA AND LATERAL CHEST:  There is a central venous catheter via left subclavian
     approach with the tip projecting at the cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax.
     There is a moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion.  There also is a hazy
     opacity in the left lateral lung base that likely reflects an additional
     smaller effusion.  There are linear nodular opacities in both lungs most
     prominent in the left mid and upper lung.  These are similar in appearance
     when compared to the scout film of CT of [**2617-8-20**] and likely reflect an
     infectious process.
     
     IMPRESSION:

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  54-year-old woman with ovarian cancer.  Abdominal pain, nausea,
     vomiting.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2617-8-30**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scanning of the abdomen and pelvis was performed
     after oral and intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformations were
     obtained.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  Since the prior study, the pleural effusions have resolved
     as has the parenchymal abnormality that was seen in the lung bases.  There is
     now some nodular appearance of the pleural surfaces along the diaphragm. Again
     seen is a markedly dilated esophagus with wall thickening, as well as contrast
     within it suggesting dysmotility.
     
     No definite liver lesions are identified. Mild prominence of the intrahepatic
     bile ducts is noted.  The gallbladder is decompressed. Fluid surrounding it is
     likely related to free fluid within the abdomen elsewhere. The adrenal glands
     appear unremarkable as does the visualized pancreas.  The spleen has some
     nodular hypoattenuating areas in the posterior periphery which despite the
     phase of contrast may represent metastatic lesions.  There is some perihepatic
     ascites. The peritoneal surface is thickened consistent with carcinomatosis.
     
     There has been no significant change in the appearance of the bowel compared
     to the prior study.  Loops of small and large bowel are in a similar
     configuration as compared to the prior study without evidence of definite
     obstruction although a few mildly dilated loops of small bowel are again seen.
     The bowel is in a somewhat unusual position anteriorly with relatively
     encapsulated appearance which may suggest the presence of an internal hernia,
     but this as well is unchanged compared to the prior study.
     
     The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast symmetrically.  There
     are again hypodensities seen in both kidneys which are not fully evaluated on
     this study.  There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.
     
     Again seen are stomas exiting on both sides of the lower abdomen.  There is no
     free intraperitoneal air.  The mild prominence of the common bile duct is a
     stable at 7 mm.  Some lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum along the left para-
     aortic region are unchanged, and no bigger than 6 mm in short axis.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  55-year-old woman with metastatic ovarian cancer, history of
     multiple small-bowel obstructions.  Nausea, vomiting.  Recent PEG tube
     placement on [**11-13**].  Fluid collection around PEG tube insertion site.
     Please evaluate for leak around the G-tube.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis from [**2617-10-28**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scanning of the abdomen was performed without
     oral or intravenous contrast.  The patient already had high-density material
     within the stomach and GI tract.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  Nodules in the right lung base are unchanged from prior
     study, and measure 8 mm and 7 mm respectively.  It is not clear whether these
     nodules are within the lung parenchyma or adjacent to it.  There is a new
     small pericardial effusion.  The esophagus is markedly dilated with high-
     density material within it consistent with dysmotility.
     
     Since the prior study there has been placement of a PEG tube via the left
     upper quadrant.
     
     Even though this is a non-contrast-enhanced scan, the tube appears to
     traverse the edge of the left lobe of the liver (this sentence added on
     attending review).
     
     The balloon appears to lie within the wall of the stomach, which may be a
     somewhat proximal position. In addition there is tissue density measuring
     roughly 5.2 x 2.3 cm in the abdominal wall surrounding the insertion site.
     
     Since the prior study, the anterior collection of ascites has increased in
     size, and now measures roughly 10.4 x 3.5 cm.  There is no evidence of the
     high-density material seen in the stomach extravasating into this area.  There
     are foci of air within this extraluminal fluid, which is somewhat unusual
     nearly two weeks out after PEG placement.  Nodularity of the peritoneum is
     unchanged consistent with carcinomatosis.  The liver is difficult to evaluate
     given lack of intravenous contrast.  The gallbladder is collapsed, and again
     seen is a [**Known patient lastname 12406**] in its neck, and there is high density more distally which
     likely represents sludge versus vicarious excretion of contrast.  The splenic

     size is unchanged.  There is no hydronephrosis in the visualized kidneys.
     No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen in the bones.  No definitely
     dilated loops of bowel are identified in the visualized abdomen. In the
     subcutaneous tissues there is dependent edema consistent with anasarca.
     
     There is a new moderate left-sided pleural effusion and a new small right-
     sided pleural effusion, both of simple fluid attenuation.  There is a small
     focus of air space disease in the left lower lobe as well as small nodularity,
     which appears similar compared to the prior study.  The new air space
     opacities may represent atelectasis.
     
     There are unchanged left renal cysts.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. G-tube appears to traverse left lateral segment of liver - findings
     communicated with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 12447**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12445**] at 8.35am on [**2617-11-27**]. The increasing
     amount of fluid around the liver may represent extravasated blood. This
     finding was identified on attending review of case and is an addition to the
     provisional unapproved report. No definite evidence of extravasation of high-
     density material from the stomach lumen into the peritoneal cavity.
     
     2.  Somewhat proximal location of the G-tube whose tip appears to terminate
     somewhat proximally perhaps in the stomach wall.
     
     3.  Probable hematoma in the subcutaneous tissues at the insertion site of the
     gastrostomy tube.
     
     4.  Increase in the amount of loculated ascites anteriorly compared to the
     prior study.  Foci of air in the peritoneal cavity are unusual 14 days after
     intervention.  This may relate, however, to the patient's extensive _____ and
     carcinomatosis.  Continued clinical correlation is recommended.
     
     5.  New bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right as well as a
     small pericardial effusion.
     
     6.  Dilated distal esophagus consistent with dysmotility.
     
     7.  Nodular opacities in the lung bases bilaterally could represent foci of
     metastatic disease.  Additionally new air space opacity in the left lower lobe
     could be atelectasis and/or superimposed infection.
     
     8.  Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
                                                                 (Over)

     HISTORY:  Indurated region around G-tube with drainage.
     
     No priors are available.  
     
     SUPERFICIAL ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND:
     
     Focused examination around the region of the known G-tube demonstrated a
     multilocular predominantly hypoechoic fluid collection displaying increased
     through transmission surrounding the entire G-tube.  Given its circumferential
     appearance, an exact size measurement was unable to be obtained by ultrasound.
     A portion of the fluid collection appears to extend inferiorly terminating
     just to the left superior aspect of the midline surgical scar.  No abnormal
     hypervascularity of the surrounding tissue was identified.  The actual fluid
     collection appears to be just deep to the superficial tissues, approximately 3
     cm underneath the skin surface.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Partially septated fluid collection circumferentially surrounding
     the G-tube site and extending inferiorly along its medial aspect is worrisome
     for an abscess given overlying skin findings and tenderness in this region.
     
     If further delineation is needed, a CT examination may be obtained.
     
     Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12445**] on date of exam at approximately
