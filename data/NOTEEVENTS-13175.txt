     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      64 year old woman with lung cancer with [**Clip Number (Radiology) 13543**] to cervical spine, C2-C3 
      intramedullary mass seen on OSH CT scan
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      assess mass                                                                     
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Metastases to cervical spine, lung cancer, with C2-C3
     intramedullary mass seen on outside hospital CT.  Assess mass.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained through the cervical spine without
     intravenous contrast.
     
     CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE:  Again seen within the left cerebellar hemisphere is
     a heterogeneously hyperdense metastatic lesion measuring 2.9 x 2.7 cm.
     
     There is an additional hyperdense focus within the cervical cord measuring 6 x
     6 mm, extending from the C3-4 interspace to the C4-5 interspace.  This is
     consistent with a hemorrhagic metastasis, with an appearance similar to the
     metastatic lesions visualized within the brain on the accompanying head CT. 
     No other definite metastatic lesions are identified within the cervical cord,
     although there is questionable hyperdensity of the cervical cord at the T2
     level, finding that could relate to streak artifact.
     
     The osseous structures of the cervical spine are imaged from C1 through the
     upper portion of T2.  No fracture is identified within the cervical spine. 
     There is a questionable faint focus of sclerosis at the inferior endplate of
     C2, finding of uncertain significance.  No other suspicious lytic or sclerotic
     lesion is identified within the osseous structures of the cervical spine.  At
     C5-6, there is degenerative change with loss of intervertebral disc space
     height and anterior and posterior osteophytosis.  A nasogastric tube and
     endotracheal tube are in place.  The prevertebral soft tissues appear
     unremarkable.
     
     The visualized portions of the lung apices demonstrate paraseptal
     emphysematous changes and airspace opacity and atelectasis.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Hyperdense focus within the cervical cord at the C4 level, consistent with
     a hemorrhagic metastasis.  Additional questionable hyperdensity within the
     cord at T2 could represent artifact.
     
     2.  Left cerebellar hemisphere hemorrhagic metastasis.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     3.  Questionable sclerotic focus within the C2 vertebra, finding that could
     represent degenerative change due to its location near the vertebral endplate,

     4.  No fracture of the cervical spine.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Transferred from outside hospital with lung cancer metastases to
     the brain and cervical cord, now quadriplegic and intubated.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     CT OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There are numerous hyperdense
     lesions with surrounding edema located within the left frontal, right and left
     parietal, left temporal lobes, and within the left cerebellar hemisphere.  The
     largest individual lesion, located in the left cerebellar hemisphere, measures
     2.9 x 3.2 cm and contains heterogeneous internal hyperdensity.  The remainder
     of the visualized lesions additionally contain peripheral and heterogeneous
     internal hyperdensity.  There are metallic clips at the skull base.  There is
     no hydrocephalus.  There is asymmetric widening of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 548**] of the
     right lateral ventricle with adjacent hypodensity in the right frontal lobe
     consistent with encephalomalacia.
     
     There is additional periventricular white matter hypodensity within the left
     frontal lobe, possibly related to the adjacent metastatic focus.
     
     An additional focus of hypodensity is seen within the subcortical white matter
     of the right frontal lobe near the vertex.  This could possibly represent
     edema related to an additional metastatic lesion.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate evidence of prior right frontal craniotomy and
     metallic coils at the skull base.  There is fluid opacification of the frontal
     and ethmoid air cells.  The maxillary and sphenoid sinuses as well as the
     mastoid air cells are normally pneumatized.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Numerous hyperdense metastatic foci within the left frontal lobe, right
     and left parietal lobes, left temporal lobe, and left cerebellar hemisphere.
     
     2.  Probable encephalomalacia within the right frontal lobe with metallic
     coils visualized at the right skull base.
     
     3.  Additional focus of hypodensity within the right frontal lobe near the
     vertex could represent edema related to a small metastatic focus.
                                                                 (Over)

     upper lobe is present.  A 2 cm opacity in the right upper lobe is present
     although this may represent the end of the right second rib in this rotated
     study.  An ETT is present, terminating approximately 3.4 cm above the carina. 
     The lungs appear otherwise clear.  An NGT terminates in the stomach with the

     CT OF THE THORACIC SPINE WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The thoracic spine is
     imaged from C7 through the upper portion of L1.  There is a compression
     deformity of the T9 vertebra with suggestion of sclerosis extending to the
     right pedicle, and with retropulsion of osseous material posteriorly to the
     canal.  There is mild narrowing of the spinal canal at this level due to the
     retropulsed osseous material.  The thecal sac appears deformed.
     
     There is additional questionable mild anterior loss of height of the T3
     vertebra.  No definite lytic or sclerotic lesion is identified at this level.
     
     Elsewhere within the thoracic spine, no definite lytic or sclerotic osseous
     lesions are identified.  No definite foci of abnormal hyperdensity are
     identified within the thoracic cord to suggest metastasis.
     
     A large left apical lung mass is seen measuring 4.7 x 4.3 cm, consistent with
     the patient's known lung cancer.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Compression fracture of T9 with posterior retropulsed osseous material
     deforming the thecal sac.
