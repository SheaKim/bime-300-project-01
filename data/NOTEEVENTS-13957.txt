     INDICATION:  Known thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm with increase in
     epigastric and back pain.  Evaluate for change in aortic aneurysm or
     dissection.
     
     COMPARISON:  CTA of the chest, abdomen and pelvis dated [**3275-2-15**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained without contrast.  Subsequently, contiguous axial images through the
     chest, abdomen, and pelvis were obtained following the administration of 100
     cc of Visipaque.  Delayed images through the abdomen and pelvis were obtained.
     Coronal and sagittal reconstructed images were also obtained.
     
     CTA OF THE CHEST, ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:  The appearance of the thoracoabdominal
     aortic aneurysm is essentially unchanged from the previous exam.  The
     aneurysmal dilation of the aorta begins at the level of the left atrium and
     continues to the level of the aortic bifurcation.  The exact measurements of
     the aneurysm in the prior report are difficult to reproduce.  However, the
     greatest axial dimensions of the aneurysm within the chest occur on series 3,
     image 87.  At this level of the right and left ventricles, the thoracic aortic
     aneurysm measures 7.6 x 5.6 cm.  At the equivalent level on the [**3275-2-2**]
     study, the aneurysm measures 7.6 x 5.7 cm.  Inferiorly, just prior to the
     aortic bifurcation, the abdominal aortic aneurysm demonstrates its greatest
     dimensions in the axial plane, best seen on series 3, image 154.  At this
     level, the aorta measures 9.5 x 5.4 cm, and it previously measured 9.4 x 5.2
     cm at the equivalent level on the prior scan.  There is circumferential
     intramural hematoma throughout the course of the aneurysm, and it is unchanged
                                                                 (Over)

     in appearance compared to the prior study.  There are small convex foci of
     contrast enhancement protruding into the intramural hematoma at multiple
     levels, in an unchanged configuration compared to the [**3274-2-1**] study.
     Linear foci of increased attenuation within the intramural hematoma are also
     unchanged.  There is no evidence of an intimal flap.  The origins of the
     celiac axis, SMA and right renal artery are unchanged in configuration from
     the prior study.  There appears to be narrowing at the celiac and SMA origins.
     The left renal artery is not definitely opacified with contrast.  This is also
     unchanged from the prior exam.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  Emphysematous changes within both
     lungs are again noted.  There are no consolidations, masses or pneumothoraces.
     No pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymph nodes.  No
     pleural or pericardial effusion.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen, pancreas, and
     adrenals are unremarkable.  The right kidney demonstrates brisk contrast
     enhancement and excretes normally.  The left kidney is again atrophic, though
     it does demonstrate some delayed enhancement with contrast.  There is
     stranding about the left kidney that is unchanged.  The unopacified loops of
     small and large bowel are unremarkable.  There is no free air, free fluid or
     lymphadenopathy within the abdomen.  The patient is post cholecystectomy.  The
     common bile duct is slightly prominent, though it is unchanged from the prior
     exam.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  The unopacified loops of bowel
     are unremarkable.  There are sigmoid diverticula, without evidence of
     diverticulitis.  The visualized portion of the bladder is unremarkable.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions.
     Coronal and sagittal reformatted images demonstrate interval central
     depression of the superior endplate of the L2 vertebral body.  This finding is
     new compared to the [**3275-2-2**] exam.
     
     Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the anatomy and
     pathology in this case (grade 5).
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Unchanged appearance of the markedly dilated and tortuous thoracoabdominal
     aneurysm as detailed above.  Multiple scattered areas of ulceration throughout
     the lumen of the aneurysm are unchanged.  There is no evidence of an intimal
     flap.  The intramural hematoma is unchanged.
     2.  Unchanged appearance of the stenotic origins of the celiac axis and SMA.
     The right renal artery is patent.
     3.  Unchanged appearance of the lack of definite contrast enhancement of the
                                                                 (Over)

     UPRIGHT AP CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  The hila are unremarkable.  The
     aorta is tortuous, and aneurysmal dilation of the aorta (based on prior CT) is
     evident just superior to the diaphragm.  The lungs are clear, without vascular
     congestion or consolidation.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The right
     extreme costophrenic angle is eliminated from the image, but it is clearly
     visualized on the CT of the same day.  The osseous structures are
     unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Aneurysmal dilation of the descending thoracic aorta.  No
     evidence of pneumonia or CHF.

     exam.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  The unopacified loops of bowel
     are unremarkable.  There are sigmoid diverticula, without evidence of
     diverticulitis.  The visualized portion of the bladder is unremarkable.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions.
     Coronal and sagittal reformatted images demonstrate interval central
     depression of the superior endplate of the L2 vertebral body.  This finding is
     new compared to the [**3275-2-2**] exam.
     
     Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the anatomy and
     pathology in this case (grade 5).
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Unchanged appearance of the markedly dilated and tortuous thoracoabdominal
     aneurysm as detailed above.  Multiple scattered areas of ulceration throughout
     the lumen of the aneurysm are unchanged.  There is no evidence of an intimal
     flap.  The intramural hematoma is unchanged.
     2.  Unchanged appearance of the stenotic origins of the celiac axis and SMA.
     The right renal artery is patent.
     3.  Unchanged appearance of the lack of definite contrast enhancement of the
                                                                 (Over)

Admission Date: [**3275-4-24**]        Discharge Date: [**3275-5-25**]

Date of Birth:  [**3204-3-11**]        Sex:  F

Service:  VSU


This is a 71 year old patient admitted on [**3275-4-24**].
Discharge date anticipated [**3275-5-17**] was cancelled. This
is a continuation of the hospital course from the discharge
summary, document #243640.

HOSPITAL COURSE, CONTINUED:  The patient's discharge was
delayed. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 803**] of the interventional radiology service
saw the patient regarding vertebroplasty for her lumbar
compression fracture. An MRI was obtained, which demonstrated
a compression fracture of the anterior aspect of the L2
vertebral body, with minimal associated T2 and STIR signal
abnormalities. The remaining vertebral bodies were normal in
height, signal and alignment. There were no epidural
collections seen. The conus medullaris ends at L1-L2, and
there was no spinal cord narrowing. Also noted on the scan
was a large left retroperitoneal hematoma in a patient who is
status post thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. There
was some edema in the muscular soft tissues posterior to the
lumbar spine at the levels of L2 to L4. These findings could
reflect dependent changes related to the patient's
longstanding supine positioning. At this point, a
vertebroplasty was deferred.

The patient in the next 24 hours developed onset of abdominal
pain and diarrhea. Abdominal CT was obtained. This CT of the
abdomen and pelvis did not show any evidence of thoraco-
aortic dissection. There was a persisting small bowel
obstruction, which had partially decompressed, and the left
abdominal wall had a surgical site seroma. The thoraco-
abdominal aneurysm repair was stable in appearance. The
appearance of the stenosis of the origin of the SMA, celiac
and right renal arteries was stable. The patient then
proceeded to surgery on [**3275-5-17**], and underwent
abdominal aortogram with selective celiac angiogram,
angioplasty, and stenting of the celiac artery through a left
brachial artery access. The patient tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred to the post anesthesia care unit in
stable condition, and returned to the VICU for continued
monitoring and care. The patient's postoperative day 1 from
her angioplasty and stenting of the celiac artery was
hemodynamically stable. White count was 13.4, hematocrit
31.5, BUN 30, creatinine 1.0. Physical examination was
remarkable for a soft, nontender abdomen with bowel sounds.
The nasogastric tube was removed and the diet was advanced as
tolerated. Ambulation was continued. The patient was
continued on TPN.

Over the next 24 hours, the patient tolerated liquids. The
TPN was continued. Physical therapy continued to work with
the patient. Psychiatry was requested to see the patient
because of a history of depression. The patient's head CT
scan was remarkable for periventricular white matter changes
and an old right insular infarct. Psychiatric felt that the
patient's [**Last Name **] problem was delirium, which was mild and
which was related to surgery and all the perioperative events
in an older woman with underlying structurally abnormal
brain. There was no evidence of anxiety present.
Recommendations were to discontinue the Ativan, give the
patient Haldol 0.5 - 1 mg IV every 4-6 hours p.r.n. for
anxiety or confusion, minimize the use of Dilaudid, or
replace with a non narcotic analgesic. The patient did
experience episodes of somnolence with Ativan and narcotics.
The narcotics were withdrawn, and the Ativan was tapered
accordingly, with improvement in the patient's somnolence.
The patient continued to show improvement, and was
transferred to the regular nursing floor on [**3275-5-23**]. The TPN
was weaned, and she was continued on diet advanced as
tolerated. Case Management was requested to begin screening
for rehab. The finalization of the [**Hospital 101**] hospital course
will be dictated at the time of discharge to rehab.

     HISTORY:  Seventy-one-year old woman with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.    
     Preoperative for surgery.  Observe for suspected coronary artery disease given
     arthrosclerotic disease elsewhere. 
      
     SUMMARY OF THE PRELIMINARY REPORT FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:  Dipyridamole was
     infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142 mg/kg/min. Two minutes
     after the cessation of infusion, Tc-99m sestamibi was administered IV.  
      
     INTERPRETATION: 
     Image Protocol: Gated SPECT. 
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium-201. 
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images. 
     This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model. 
      
     Left ventricular cavity is normal. 
     Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the
     myocardium. 
      
     Gated images reveal normal wall motion. 
     The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 83%. 
      
     IMPRESSION: 1. Normal myocardial perfusion. 2. Normal left ventricular cavity
     size and function.

     STUDY:  Carotid series complete.
     
     REASON:  TIA.
     
     FINDINGS:  Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid arteries.  No
     plaque was identified.
     
     On the right, peak systolic velocities are 72, 40, and 55 in the ICA, CCA, and
     ECA respectively.  The ICA:CCA ratio is 1.8.  This is consistent with less
     than 40% stenosis.
     
     On the left, peak systolic velocities are 60, 52, and 101 in the ICA, CCA, and
     ECA respectively.  The ICA:CCA ratio is 1.2.  This is consistent with less
     than 40% stenosis.
     
     There is antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.

     INDICATION:  A 71-year-old female status post thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm
     repair.  Evaluate position of pulmonary artery catheter.
     
     FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube extends into the left main bronchus.  An NG
     tube passes into the stomach.  A left-sided chest tube extends into the left
     upper pleural space.  A left-sided central line extends from the region of the
     left internal jugular vein.  The distal tip of this catheter overlies the
     region of the aortic arch, but likely is positioned within the
     innominate vein on the left.  A right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter terminates within
     the main pulmonary artery.  Pulmonary parenchymal opacity is present within
     both lungs. There is a small amount of pulmonary edema.  Subcutaneous gas is
     present along the left chest wall.  There is a tiny left apical pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION: 
     1.  The endotracheal tube extends into the left main stem bronchus.  This
     finding was reported to the clinical team responsible for this patient's care,
     and reflects intended endobronchial intubation.
     2.  Tiny left apical pneumothorax with left-sided chest tubes terminating
     within the left upper pleural space.
     3.  A left IJ central venous catheter is in place with its distal tip likely
     in position within the innominate vein.  The distal tip of this catheter does
     overlie the arch of the aorta and clinical correlation is suggested to confirm
     the position of this catheter.
     4.  Opacity within both lungs (right greater than left) reflecting pulmonary
     edema/atelectasis in this patient status post repair of a thoracic aortic
     aneurysm.

     COMPARISON: [**3275-5-4**]
     
     INDICATION:  Line change.
     
     A right internal jugular catheter is in satisfactory position within the
     superior vena cava.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
     
     Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There are small bilateral
     pleural effusions, left greater than right, with apparent loculation of the
     left effusion laterally.  The left effusion is stable, but the right effusion
     has slightly improved.  There is patchy increased opacity at both lung bases,
     most likely due to atelectasis.  Surgical clips are seen in the left chest
     wall, and there are fractures of left ribs in the mid portion of the left
     chest.  The latter findings are stable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Persistent bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with
     interval slight decrease in right effusion.
     
     2)  Satisfactory positioning of vascular catheter with no pneumothorax.

     progression of contrast.
     
     COMPARISON:  CTA abdomen with and without contrast and reconstruction dated
     [**3275-5-14**] at 2:22.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector imaging was obtained from bilateral lung bases
     through the pubic symphysis without intravenous contrast.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH ORAL, WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There are bilateral
     pleural effusions, with compressive atelectasis.  A nasogastric tube descends
     below the diaphragm, and there are dense coronary artery calcifications.
     Imaging of the abdomen is limited by the lack of intravenous contrast.
     Allowing for this, the liver is normal in attenuation without nodules or
     masses.  The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and bilateral adrenals are normal.
     There is a right duplicated kidney, with small atrophic left kidney.  The
     patient is status post thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair.  Postoperative
     hematoma tracks along the left retroperitoneum/psoas muscle.  Nasogastric tube
     terminates within the stomach, and the stomach is decompressed.  There is an
     interval decrease in the dilation of the proximal small bowel loops, without
     interval progression of contrast.  Previously noted narrowed small bowel is
     again identified within the mid abdomen.  More distal loops of small bowel are
     decompressed.  The colon is partly decompressed, with segments containing
     fluid and gas.  There is a small amount of intraabdominal free fluid.  There
     is no free air.  Soft tissue stranding is identified along the right anterior
     abdominal wall, there is no defect of the wall to suggest anterior abdominal
     wall hernia.  This additionally correlates with prior intravenous contrast
     imaging.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL, WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is diffuse
     atherosclerotic disease extending into the pelvis.  A Foley catheter is within
     a decompressed bladder.  The sigmoid, rectum, and uterus are unremarkable.
     There is mild left inguinal soft tissue stranding.  There is no inguinal, or

     INDICATION:  71-year-old female with decreased mental status.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial noncontrast CT imaging of the brain.  No studies are
     available for comparison on PACs.
     
     FINDINGS:  Images are blurry, secondary to technique.  There is no evidence of
     acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline
     structures. The ventricles and sulci are prominent, a finding that is
     consistent with involutional change.  There is extensive hypodensity within
     the periventricular white matter in a pattern consistent with chronic
     microvascular infarction.  An old area of infarction is likely present within
     the right insular region.
     
     Bone windows show clear paranasal sinuses.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
     2)  Hypodensity within the periventricular white matter that has an appearance
     suggestive of chronic microvascular infarction as well as an old area of
     infarction within the right insular region.  If there is clinical need to
     exclude acute infarction, an MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging could be
     performed (assuming that the patient is MRI compatible).

     INDICATION:  Recent thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair, now with elevated white
     count, increased NG output, and mental status change.
     
     COMPARISON:  Preop exam [**3275-4-23**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis with oral contrast and before and
     after the administration of intravenous contrast.  The intravenous contrast
     bolus was limited by the access route (central line).
     
     ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  There is bibasilar atelectasis with a
     moderate sized left pleural effusion.  The patient has undergone
     thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair.  There is no evidence of contrast
     extravasation from the repair.  Persistent abnormal soft tissue density is
     noted at the origin of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries, as before,
     and likely partially related to postoperative hematoma. Postoperative hematoma
     tracks along the left retroperitoneum/psoas muscle, and is of mixed density.
     
     There is a nasogastric tube within the stomach.  The stomach is decompressed,
     but the prior duodenum as well as the proximal small bowel loops are dilated.
     A transition point is noted in the left lower abdomen at the level of the
     anterior iliac crest, beyond which the distal small bowel loops are
     decompressed.  The colon is partly decompressed, with some segments containing
     fluid and gas.
     
     There is mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, as before.  No focal
     liver abnormalities are appreciated.  These spleen, pancreas, and adrenal
     glands are within normal limits.  The left kidney is again noted to be a
     atrophic, and again seen is cortical loss on the right.  The right kidney is
     beginning to excrete some contrast.  No contrast is yet visible within the
     left collecting system.  There is no free abdominal fluid.
     
     PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There is a small soft tissue density collection within
     the left abdominal wall.  The bladder is decompressed by a Foley catheter. The

     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Small bowel obstruction with transition point in the left lower abdomen.
     This may represent either an early complete or a partial obstruction.  Close
     clinical correlation is recommended, and repeat CT scan may be helpful in
     differentiating early complete from partial obstruction as the contrast
     progresses through the bowel.
     2.  Retroperitoneal hematoma, likely postoperative.
     3.  Stable soft tissue density surrounding the celiac and superior mesenteric
     arteries, likely representing hematoma.  The proximal portion of the SMA is
     not well visualized, also stable.

     count, increased NG output, and mental status change.
     
     COMPARISON:  Preop exam [**3275-4-23**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis with oral contrast and before and
     after the administration of intravenous contrast.  The intravenous contrast
     bolus was limited by the access route (central line).
     
     ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  There is bibasilar atelectasis with a
     moderate sized left pleural effusion.  The patient has undergone
     thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair.  There is no evidence of contrast
     extravasation from the repair.  Persistent abnormal soft tissue density is
     noted at the origin of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries, as before,
     and likely partially related to postoperative hematoma. Postoperative hematoma
     tracks along the left retroperitoneum/psoas muscle, and is of mixed density.
     
     There is a nasogastric tube within the stomach.  The stomach is decompressed,
     but the prior duodenum as well as the proximal small bowel loops are dilated.
     A transition point is noted in the left lower abdomen at the level of the
     anterior iliac crest, beyond which the distal small bowel loops are
     decompressed.  The colon is partly decompressed, with some segments containing
     fluid and gas.
     
     There is mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, as before.  No focal
     liver abnormalities are appreciated.  These spleen, pancreas, and adrenal
     glands are within normal limits.  The left kidney is again noted to be a
     atrophic, and again seen is cortical loss on the right.  The right kidney is
     beginning to excrete some contrast.  No contrast is yet visible within the
     left collecting system.  There is no free abdominal fluid.
     
     PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There is a small soft tissue density collection within
     the left abdominal wall.  The bladder is decompressed by a Foley catheter. The
     bladder contains some iatrogenic gas.  The pelvic loops of bowel are grossly

     INDICATION:  71-year-old female status post thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm
     repair and L2 fracture.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1, T2, and STIR imaging of the lumbar spine without
     contrast.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is compression of the anterior aspect of the L2 vertebral
     body with minimal associated T2 and STIR signal abnormalities.  The remainder
     of the vertebral bodies are normal in height, signal, and alignment.  No
     epidural collections are seen.  The conus medullaris ends at  L1/2.   No
     spinal canal narrowing is seen.  A large left retroperitoneal hematoma is
     present adjacent to the iliopsoas musculature.  Abnormal signal on T2 weighted
     imaging is present within the musculature posterior to the lumbar spine at the
     levels of L2 through L5.  A T2 bright elliptical collection is seen with
     within the subcutaneous tissues posterior to the L2 and L4 vertebral bodies
     approximately 1 cm deep to the skin surface.  This could be dependent edema
     and clinical corrleation is needed to determine the significance of this
     finding.
     
     IMPRESSION:   1)  Compression deformity of the anterior L2 vertebral body with
     associated abnormal mild signal on T2 and STIR imaging suggesting edema.
     Please note that this L2 compression deformity was present on a CT of the
     abdomen from [**3275-4-23**].
     
     2)  Large left retroperitoneal hematoma in this patient status post
     thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
     
     3)  Edema within the musculature and soft tissues posterior to the lumbar
     spine at the levels from  L2 through L4. These findings could reflect
     dependent changes related to the patient's long standing supine positioning.
     Please correlate with clinical exam.

     INDICATION:  Status post aneurysm repair, please rule out thoracic dissection
     prior to re-cath.
     
     COMPARISONS:  CT abdomen/pelvis of [**3275-5-14**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images through the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to the
     level of the femoral heads, with 100 mL of non-ionic Optiray contrast
     administered by rapid bolus.  No reformats were performed.
     
     CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a partially loculated left-sided pleural
     effusion, with associated passive atelectasis.  There is a very small right-
     sided effusion/thickening, with associated atelectasis.  There is a small
     amount of fluid tracking within the fissure at the right base, simulating a
     nodule.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  NG tube is identified with its tip in
     the stomach.  Right-sided IJ line is seen, with its tip unchanged in position.
     Heart and pericardium are unremarkable.  There is no pericardial effusion. The
     airways are patent to the segmental level.  The patient is status post
     thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair.  The thoracic aorta demonstrates multiple
     areas of ulceration, however, demonstrates no evidence of dissection.  There
     is some residual hematoma/postoperative changes within the corrected aneurysm
     sac, not significantly changed from the prior study. The remaining great
     vessels are unremarkable.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen, and pancreas are
     unremarkable.  There is persisting small-bowel obstruction, with a transition
     point identified in the left lower quadrant, unchanged from the prior study.
     There appears to have been some interval decompression of the proximal small
     bowel loops, which now measure only up to 2.5 cm in diameter, however, still
     demonstrate air-fluid levels, and distal decompression.  There is no free air
     or free fluid within the abdomen.  The right kidney demonstrates mild cortical
     thinning.  The left kidney is atrophic and demonstrates no detectable contrast
     enhancement.  A patent contrast filled left renal artery is not identified.
     There remains stenosis at the origin of the celiac, SMA, and right renal
     arteries.

     INDICATION:  Status post aneurysm repair, please rule out thoracic dissection
     prior to re-cath.
     
     COMPARISONS:  CT abdomen/pelvis of [**3275-5-14**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images through the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to the
     level of the femoral heads, with 100 mL of non-ionic Optiray contrast
     administered by rapid bolus.  No reformats were performed.
     
     CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a partially loculated left-sided pleural
     effusion, with associated passive atelectasis.  There is a very small right-
     sided effusion/thickening, with associated atelectasis.  There is a small
     amount of fluid tracking within the fissure at the right base, simulating a
     nodule.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  NG tube is identified with its tip in
     the stomach.  Right-sided IJ line is seen, with its tip unchanged in position.
     Heart and pericardium are unremarkable.  There is no pericardial effusion. The
     airways are patent to the segmental level.  The patient is status post
     thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair.  The thoracic aorta demonstrates multiple
     areas of ulceration, however, demonstrates no evidence of dissection.  There
     is some residual hematoma/postoperative changes within the corrected aneurysm
     sac, not significantly changed from the prior study. The remaining great
     vessels are unremarkable.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen, and pancreas are
     unremarkable.  There is persisting small-bowel obstruction, with a transition
     point identified in the left lower quadrant, unchanged from the prior study.
     There appears to have been some interval decompression of the proximal small
     bowel loops, which now measure only up to 2.5 cm in diameter, however, still
     demonstrate air-fluid levels, and distal decompression.  There is no free air
     or free fluid within the abdomen.  The right kidney demonstrates mild cortical
     thinning.  The left kidney is atrophic and demonstrates no detectable contrast
     enhancement.  A patent contrast filled left renal artery is not identified.
     There remains stenosis at the origin of the celiac, SMA, and right renal
     arteries.

     COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated [**3275-5-20**].
     
     AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The right IJ line is unchanged.  There are
     bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.  The left-sided effusion
     appears to be partially loculated and is stable in appearance compared to the
     prior study.  There is persistent left lower lobe opacity.  The pulmonary
     vessels are not engorged.  The right lung appears grossly clear.  No evidence
     of pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Persistent, apparently partially loculated left-sided effusion
     and left lower lobe opacity, unchanged compared to study of 4 days prior.  The
     left lower lobe opacity may be atelectatic in nature although infectious
     process cannot be excluded.
