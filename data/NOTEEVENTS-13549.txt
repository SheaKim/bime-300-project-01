Allergies: 
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1928**] 
Chief Complaint:
J-tube displacement
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
G-J tube placement by interventional radiology
 
History of Present Illness:
HPI: 78M with ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 15%), s/p trach with chronic 
vent-dependence, s/p G-tube and J-tube placement, admitted after 
J-tube was accidentally pulled out by the patient and attempts 
at replacing it were unsuccessful.  Per HRC notes, patient had 
his G-tube and J-tubes placed at the [**Hospital **] Hospital for 
gastroparesis in 12/06.  The G-tube is for drainage (very 
high-output per HRC), J-tube is for tube feeds.
.
In the ED, VS were T 99.6, HR 110, BP 121/86, RR 16, 95% on AC 
550x14/5/0.40.  Blood cultures were drawn and reinsertion of the 
J-tube was unsuccessful again.  Surgery was consulted and they 
were also unable to replace the tube.  He was sent for a G-J 
tube study which showed the G-tube in appropriate position.  BP 
dropped to 80s-90s systolic.  He was started on D5NS at 50cc/hr. 
 He was admitted to the MICU with the plan to replace the J-tube 
in IR the following day.

Admission G tube check
INDICATION:  78-year-old man with reposition of G-tube. 
  
No prior studies for comparison. 
  
FINDINGS: A single image of the abdomen demonstrates a tube 
overlying the 
pyloric junction.  Contrast is seen within the abdomen.  There 
is no evidence 
of extravasation on this single film.  There are degenerative 
changes of the 
lower lumbar spine.  Bowel gas pattern is unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1.  G-tube overlying pylorus.  No evidence of extravasation on 
this single 
radiograph. 
*
 
Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 78M with DMI, ESRD, CAD, CHF (EF 15%), admitted after 
J-tube displacement.
.
# 
The patient had a G-J tube placed by interventional radiology. 
Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of inteventional radiology the G tube is 
directly above the pylorus and his output should be closely 
monitored.  Should the tube have decrased output or should the 
patient develop abdominal pain then the patient may need an open 
surgery to replace the tube. The tube was also placed through 
the stoma of the old site without anesthesia or sedation per IR. 
The tube feeds can be administered through the J tube 
immediately but tube feeds should only begin on [**3107-3-1**] one day 
after the placement of the J-G tube. 
.
# ESRD:  On HD M/W/F
.
# CAD:  
The patient was noted to have an elevated troponin of 0.32. 
Serial CKs were 11 and 12 respectively.  Given his hemodyamic 
stability and unchanged ECG this was thought to be chronic or a 
troponin leak in the setting of his ESRD. 
.
# C. diff colitis:  
He was continued on po vancomycin and flagyl. 
.
# DMII:
FS qid and SSI. 
.
# CHF: No current signs of hypervolemia.  AICD in place.
- continue to monitor
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Currently under good control, no 
anticoagulation.
- continue to monitor
.
# FEN:
- His K repletion was continued. He was continued on 
.
# Ppx:
- PPI
- SC heparin
.
# Access: R SC 
.
# Code status: DNR [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital 83**] Hospital d/c summary, however pt 
has AICD
