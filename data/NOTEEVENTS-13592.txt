ADMISSION CHEST COMPLAINT:
1.  Free intraperitoneal air.
2.  Status post myocardial infarction.
3.  Ischemic gut.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known patient firstname 9348**] [**Known patient lastname 9349**] was a 79 year-old
Caucasian female who was referred from an outlying facility
having been approximately several days status post an acute
myocardial infarction. The patient experienced a low flow
state during this period of time. In addition she was
receiving steroid therapy for exacerbation of her chronic
lung disease. Prior to being transferred to the medical
Intensive Care Unit at the [**Hospital1 391**] the patient had undergone a CT scan which revealed
free intraperitoneal air. At this point in time the patient
had a stat transfer to the surgical service arranged. The
patient was then a direct admit to the trauma surgical
Intensive Care Unit where appropriate intravenous access was
achieved. Because of the nature of the patient's comorbidity
the family was cautioned that both intraoperative and
postoperative course were likely to be quite stormy.

The patient was taken to the operating room where upon
laparotomy an extension infarction of the colon was noted.
She underwent a total abdominal colectomy and an end
ileostomy. The patient was returned to the trauma surgical
Intensive Care Unit in critical condition. The patient was
maintained over the next 24 hours with extensive coverage
with inotropic agents and vasopressors. The patient
essentially made no meaningful physiologic recovery.
Approximately 12 hours after her surgical procedure an
extensive discussion was held with the family regarding the
fact that it will be unlikely that she will recovery. The
patient's family then asked the patient be made Do Not
Resuscitate and receive comfort measures. This was done. The
patient subsequently expired quietly.
