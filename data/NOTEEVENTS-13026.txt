DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  (Wound care as follows)
1.  Clean all areas of flap and donor site with saline gauze.
2.  Continue xeroform q.d. to flap and donor site.
3.  Physical activity is limited to prevent the patient from
especially moving his head and neck; including no extraneous
neck flexion of extension to prevent injury to the neck flap.

T/SICU Nursing Admission Note
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 4325**] is a 62 year old man admitted to the T/SICU s/p L maxillary resection (wide) with a deltopectorial free flap.  He is admitted here for flap monitoring and airway protection.  PMH significant for squamous cell carcinoma of the L maxilla which has had multiple resection, radiation, reconstructions, the last being in 11/01.  He is an IDDM with NKA.  He currently lives in [**Location **], NH with his daughter [**Name (NI) 2133**] who is a nurse.
OR course was significant for a low blood sugar (reported as 10) and labile blood pressure requiring neosynepherine.  He arrived to the T/SICU with plastics and anesthesia around 9 pm [**9-5**].  
REVIEW Of SYSTEMS:
Neuro: on propofol and receiving morphine intermittently for pain. Moves all extremities, follows commands.  Hands restrained.
CVS: BP labile.  Receiving neo to keep map >70, received 2 fluid boluses totally 1500cc for low blood pressure with good results.  Lytes repleted
RESP: initially unable to suction as I met resistance but with lavage and bagging suctioned for plugs of bloody secretions.  Pt. was fiberotically intubated...trach set ordered to the bed side.  ABGs improved after successful suctioning
RENAL:urine output drifted down to 30cc/hr but increased after fluid given.
ENDO: started on insulin gtt and titrated to keep bs<130
GI: peg in place, carafate started
ID: on kefzol, flagyl
SKIN: see carevue for flap changes.  It seems very sensitive to positioning.  Currently has sluggish cap refill (8sec) with small area superiorly which is very pale.  Flap is cool to touch.  Head kept towards left to prevent tension on pedicle.  L leg skin graft site with dsd with small amount of staining.
SOCIAL: daughter [**Name (NI) 2133**] advised of status after pt arrived.  
A: hemodynamically labile with varying cap refill of flap s/p L deltopectoral pedicle flap.
P: keep sedated and intubated today to allow ease of positioning of flap to increase likelihood of viability.  Keep MAP>70 with neo.  Monitor bs carefully as pt is quite brittle, ??readiness for enteral feedings.

     CHEST, PA, LATERAL AND OBLIQUES, [**2643-9-20**]
     
     INDICATION:  Evaluate questionable nodule at the right upper zone laterally.
     
     FINDINGS:  A right posterior oblique view of the thorax and a lateral view are
     provided. A comparison study is dated [**2643-9-4**].  There is again evidence of a
     faint ovoid opacity overlying the right 6th rib anterolaterally.  This opacity
     appears to move with the rib and therefore probably represents a bone island.
     It is not seen on other earlier studies since it would be superimposed by
     other ribs on the standard lateral views.  The appearance is otherwise
     unremarkable.  No significant abnormality of the heart, lungs, pleura or
     mediastinum can be identified.  In particular, no definite pulmonary
     infiltrates or effusions are seen.  The heart and pulmonary vessels are
     unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Small radiopaque opacity overlies the right 6th rib
     anterolaterally and almost certainly represents a small bone island.  It does
     not appear to be in the lung.  No other significant cardiopulmonary
     abnormality is demonstrated.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Cancer, evaluate extent.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Axial contrast-enhanced CT scans were obtained from the skull base
     through the thoracic inlet.
     
     Comparison is made to the previous CT of [**2643-7-31**].
     
     The patient's head is elevated for this exam so the scans were obtained in an
     oblique direction. There is a known left maxillary mass which extends into the
     left inferior orbital rim. This has increased in size substantially since the
     previous study of [**2643-7-31**]. The mass appears to erode part of the mandible,
     near the midline and just to the left of midline. Mass abutts the hard palate
     ad though a clearcut defect in this bone is not identified, there is some
     irregularity. There is mucosal thickening in the left posterior nasal cavity.
     
     There is a large mass of the skull base which is at least 3 cm across and is
     centered in the location of the horizontal portion of the right carotid canal.
     There is erosion through the canal and into the posterior sphenoid. Part of
     the clivus also appears to be involved. The basilar artery is displaced to the
     left by the mass. The right carotid artery cannot be clearly followed through
     the skull base, but enhancement is identified in this vessel at the level of
     the cavernous sinus and above.
     
     There is also some irregularity of the posterior right occipital bone, but
     this is only partially viewed. A metastasis cannote be excluded in this
     location. Contrast is identified in both sigmoid and jugular junctions. There
     is opacification of most of the left mastoid air cells. The right mastoid is
     aerated.
     
     There are multiple pulmonary nodules, presumably metastases, in the superior
     aspects of the lungs which are included in this scan.
     
     IMPRESSION: The left facial mass has enlarged since the previous study. There
     is a metastatic lesion involving the skull base and destroying bone and
     displacing carotid and vertebral arteries. There may be other skull
     metastases, but the examination is limited.
     
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12246**] was informed of the findings at 3:40 PM on [**2643-12-22**].

     COMPARISON:  Neck CT from [**2643-12-22**] and [**2643-7-31**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT of the chest with IV contrast.  100 cc Optiray was
     administered.  5 mm contiguous axial images were obtained from the thoracic
     inlet to the upper abdomen.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are multiple pulmonary nodules within
     both lungs, consistent with pulmonary metastatic disease.  When compared with
     the [**2643-7-31**] study, the right apical anterior nodule measures 1.4 x 1.2 cm,
     seen best on Image 5, Series 3A.  This is increased in size from 6 x 6 mm.
     There is an additional large nodule seen at the extreme right lung base
     measuring 1.5 x 1.7 cm and is seen best on Image 44, Series 3A.  There are no
     pleural or pericardial effusions.  There are retained secretions within the
     distal trachea.  There is geographic linear opacification along the medial
     lung apices that is likely related to radiation change.  There are multiple
     small mediastinal lymph nodes, none of which is greater than 1 cm in short
     diameter.  Heart does not appear enlarged. There is bilateral gynecomastia.
     There are coronary artery calcifications.
     
     The upper abdomen is visualized.  There is minimal central intrahepatic ductal
     dilatation.  The spleen and adrenal glands are unremarkable.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious osseous lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:  There are multiple pulmonary nodules consistent with diffuse
     metastatic disease.
