                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  69-year-old woman with paraaortic mass who also states she has lower 
     back pain, evaluate for metastases.
     
     INTERPRETATION:  Whole body views of the skeleton show abnormal increased tracer
     uptake within the right sacrum.  There is also some irregular tracer uptake in
     the  right side of the L5 vertebral body.  No other areas of abnormal tracer 
     uptake are identified.
     
     The above described findings are nonspecific.  While these could represent 
     metastatic disease, the patient states she had recent trauma and was told that
     she has a fracture in this area.
     
     The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer
     excretion.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Nonspecific pattern of abnormal tracer uptake within the right
     sacrum and right side of L5 vertebral body.  While these could be due to
     metastatic disease the patient states she has a history of a fracture in this
     region.  Recommend correlative pelvic bone CT for confirmation.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Para-aortic mass.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  After the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to
     the patient, written informed consent was obtained.  Pre-procedure timeout
     information was obtained, confirming the patient's identity and the nature of
     the procedure.
     
     Initial axial images of the abdomen were obtained without intravenous
     contrast, followed by images in the arteriographic and venographic phase,
     prior to biopsy.  CT arteriogram reveals a soft tissue mass surrounding the
     proximal abdominal aorta, demonstrating delayed enhancement.  Left adrenal
     mass is once again noted, measuring approximately 1.8 cm, and 18 Hounsfield
     units on the unenhanced portion of the study, hence not meeting strict imaging
     criteria for a benign adrenal adenoma, and may represent a lipid-poor adenoma
     or metastasis. Renal cysts are noted.  Pancreas, spleen, and gallbladder are
     unremarkable. Within the right lobe of the liver, a nonenhancing 5 mm lesion
     is identified, too small to characterize on this examination.
     
     Using local anesthesia, sterile technique and CT fluoroscopy guidance, a 19-
     gauge coaxial needle was inserted into the left para-aortic region.
     Subsequently, three 20-gauge core biopsy samples of the para-aortic soft
     tissue mass were obtained.  The samples were submitted to the cytology fellow,
     who was present during the procedure.  The samples were not clearly diagnostic
     at the time of the procedure, and due to the para-aortic location of the mass,
     no further attempts were made to biopsy the mass.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Core biopsy of para-aortic soft tissue mass without immediate
     complications.
     
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3403**] was present during the procedure.

     CT SCAN OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST [**2804-6-30**]:
     
     INDICATION:  Adrenal mass, please do washout study.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT scan of the abdomen was obtained without IV contrast using 5 mm
     slice thickness, followed by contrast-enhanced images at 60 seconds and 15
     minutes.
     
     FINDINGS:  A 1.8 cm left adrenal mass is once again identified, measuring
     approximately 19 Hounsfield units before intravenous contrast.  Absolute
     washout at 15 minutes measures 26%-30%, hence not meeting the criteria for a
     lipid-[**Doctor First Name **] adenoma.  The right adrenal gland is normal.  A delayed-enhancing
     periaortic soft tissue mass is once again identified surrounding the upper
     abdominal aorta and origins of the superior mesenteric artery and celiac
     artery.
     
     The spleen and pancreas are unremarkable.  No suspicious liver lesions.  There
     is trace prominence of the intrahepatic bile ducts.  The common bile duct
     measures approximately 8 mm in diameter, which is at the upper limits of
     normal for age.  No adenopathy.  The gallbladder contains dense material,
     possibly representing sludge.
     
     An enhancing 1.8cm right renal mass is identified, which contain areas of low
     density, possibly fat, and this lesion may represent an angiomyolipoma or
     small renal cell carcinoma. Renal cysts are noted.
     
     No suspicious bony lesions.
     
     Lung bases demonstrate trace dependent changes.
     
     IMPRESSION:  
     
     1) 1.8 cm left adrenal mass, not demonstrating significant washout.  This
     adrenal mass is indeterminate, and may represent a metastasis, adrenal
     neoplasm or adrenal adenoma. If desired, adrenal biopsy could be performed
     under CT guidance.
     
     2) 1.8 cm enhancing right renal mass, possibly an angiomyolipoma versus small
     renal cell carcinoma. If the adrenal lesion and/or paraaortic mass are to be
     biopsied, correlation with histology of the adrenal or paraaortic mass is

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 9723**] is a 69 yo female w/ h/o HTN and recent finding of 
periaortic mass who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 19**] after 
attempted work up of periaortic mass.  Prior to pt's last 
admission, she had sudden onset fatigue in [**2804-4-13**].  She was 
visiting a friend in [**Name2 (NI) 1748**] at the time and decided to return 
to [**Location (un) **].  She spent the next 2-3 weeks lying in bed due to her 
fatigue and only rose to drink, eat and go to the bathroom.  She 
returned to her baseline state for roughly one week when she 
awoke with crampy lower abdominal pain.   She continued to have 
intermittent lower abdominal pain and saw her PCP who gave her 
Protonix which helped slightly.  Within a day she was near her 
baseline and went to a wedding where she felt well enough to 
eat.   There she had the sudden onset of 10/10 lower abdominal 
pain that radiated around her sides to her back. She had no 
other symptoms. 
.
She went to the [**Hospital1 114**] ED and had a CT scan of the abdomen.  
She reports that after this scan, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] 
for further work up.  At [**Hospital1 19**], she underwent extensive work up 
with multiple imaging studies which revealed a periaortic mass, 
an intense systemic inflammatory response, and lesions in both 
the left adrenal gland and the parenchyma of the right kidney.  
During her admission, two attempts at CT-guided biopsy of the 
periaortic mass were obtained; however, did not produce adequate 
tissue for analysis.  Because these attempts were 
non-diagnostic, it was decided that she will need a laparotomy 
and retroperitoneal dissection to obtain adequate tissue.   Dr. 
[**Last Name (STitle) **], from general surgery, requested that this surgery be 
scheduled electively so that he may coordinate with vascular 
surgery.   
.
Of note, MR also revealed a 1.8 cm left adrenal gland of 
suspicious nature as not fatty on MRI and poor washout on 
dedicated CT of adrenal.  Serum metanephrines wnl making 
pheochromatosis unlikely.  Urine metanephrines only mildly 
elevated (520) with upper level of normal being 510.  Cortisol 
and ACTH levels, including after dexamethasone suppression test, 
consistent with stressed state, difficult to interpret in 
hospitalized setting.  Given suspiciousness of glan on imaging, 
it is recommended that the left adrenal be removed if possible 
during biopsy surgery to conclusively identify etiology.
.
The patient was discharged on [**7-8**] with plans to return for 
elective surgery for resection of periaortic tissue for biopsy.  
The patient was given very high dose oxycontin for pain control 
at the time of discharge.  Since discharge, the patient reports 
continued excrutiating abdominal pain.  She returns today as a 
direct admission due to excessive pain not well controlled by 
her outpatient doses of oxycontin.

Brief Hospital Course:
70 yo female deceased from complications of a thoracoabdominal 
pneumococcal mycotic aneurysm.
Pt. had a prolonged hospital course which can be characterized 
by multiple organ system failure secondary to the complications 
of her aneurysm.  She underwent a repair of her thoracoabdominal 
pneumococcal mycotic aneurysm on [**7-26**]  followed by an 
exploratory laparotomy, splenectomy, partial hepatectomy, and 
cholecystectomy on [**8-11**]
with a second look exploratory laparotomy on [**8-12**].  SHe then 
underwent an axillary-femoral bypass graft [**8-17**] in preparation 
for graft excision and a colonoscopy [**8-18**].  She underwent an 
excision of aortic graft and left nephrectomy on [**8-19**] and an 
exploratory laparotomy and liver biopsy [**8-25**].  During this time 
she had developed renal failure and ARDS.  She was also 
intermittently coagulopathic requiring massive transfusions.  
She had a massive gi bleed which was found to be due to ischemic 
injury of both the right colon and stomach on EGD and 
colonoscopy.  She was again coagulopathic over the time up to 
her death and a liver biopsy was performed on [**8-25**] in the 
morning to evaluate the viability of her liver.  Later in the 
day on the 13th the family chose to make her comfort measures 
only and she expired shortly thereafter.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Paraaortic soft tissue mass, please reassess aorta.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT arteriogram of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained with and
     without IV contrast.  Multiplanar reconstructions were generated, and were
     helpful for diagnosis.  Comparison is made with prior CT scans dated [**2804-6-30**]
     and [**2804-6-23**].
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Lung bases demonstrate a linear atelectasis or
     scar on the left.
     
     Evaluation of the abdominal viscera is limited due to arterial phase timing of
     the contrast bolus.  The previously noted hypodense right lobe lesion within
     the liver is faintly identified once again.  Right adrenal gland, pancreas,
     and spleen are unremarkable.  Right adrenal gland is normal.  Left adrenal
     mass is once again identified, measuring 1.8 cm in diameter, as previously
     noted ([**2804-6-30**]).  Previously noted right renal lesion is once again
     identified, unchanged, measuring approximately 1.8 cm in diameter.  Left
     kidney is unremarkable.  Stomach and small bowel are within normal limits.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Uterus appears to have been removed.  Urinary
     bladder and colon are within normal limits.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There has been interval partial healing of the previously noted
     right sacral fracture.  Degenerative changes are seen within the lumbar spine.
     
     CT ARTERIOGRAM WITH IV CONTRAST:  The previously noted paraaortic soft tissue
     mass is once again identified, measuring up to approximately 1.3 cm in maximal
     axial thickness.  However, there is new aneurysmal dilatation and penetrating
     ulceration within the distal thoracic aorta and proximal abdominal aorta,
     distant from the prior biopsy sites, where the aorta now measures
     approximately 4.1 cm transverse x 3.4 cm AP (previously approximately 3.2 cm
     transverse x 2.8 cm AP when measured at a similar level on the prior study
     dated [**2804-6-30**]).
     
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     There is mild stenosis at the origin of the celiac artery.  There is new focal
     dissection of the most proximal approximately 1 cm of the superior mesenteric
     artery, though the remainder of the superior mesenteric artery and entire
     inferior mesenteric artery are widely patent.  Both renal arteries are widely
     patent as well.
     
     Multiplanar reconstructions confirm the above findings, and were helpful for
     diagnosis.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Interval development of penetrating ulceration and aneurysmal
     dilatation of the distal thoracic and proximal abdominal aorta, distant from
     prior biopsy site, with stable appearance of paraaortic soft tissue mass in
     this area.  Given the development of aneurysmal dilatation, this finding is
     suggestive of an inflammatory process, such as an aortitis and/or inflammatory
     aneurysm.

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status post thoraco-abdominal aneurysm repair with
     reimplantation of the celiac artery and tube grafts to the left renal and SMA,
     to assess graft patency.
     
     Color flow and pulse Doppler evaluation of the abdominal vasculature was
     performed.  Definite patency of the celiac and hepatic arteries can be seen
     with flow into the hepatic parenchyma documented by pulse Doppler.  The liver
     parenchyma itself is abnormal in appearance with a heterogeneous pattern
     suggesting possible ischemic injury.  The SMA graft could not be confidently
     identified and both pulse and color flow Doppler evaluation of the left kidney
     show minimal-to-no intrarenal flow in the left kidney.  Evaluation of the
     right kidney shows a relatively normal flow throughout.  The aorta itself is
     patent, but there appears to be an area with a hematoma surrounding the aorta
     at or near one of the graft takeoffs, which may be narrowing flow.
     
     CONCLUSION:  This is a difficult portable study showing patency of the celiac
     and hepatic arteries on right renal artery.  Very little-to-no flow is seen in
     the left kidney, suggesting compromise of the left renal artery graft.  The
     SMA graft is difficult to fully assess and patency cannot be determined with
     certitude.
     
     A marked heterogeneity in the liver suggestive of ischemic damage.

     COMPARISON:  [**2804-7-27**] at 14:23.
     
     REPORT:
     
     Tip of ETT is 2.7 cm above the carina.  A Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed
     and a right introducer sheath remains in place with tip in SVC.  Two left
     chest tubes remain in place, and there is no PTX.
     
     The interval change is the presence of increased amount of right pleural fluid
     layering out and some atelectasis at the right base.  The right midlung field
     still shows some increased linear markings and this should be followed to
     assess for stability or evolution.
     
     NGT extends below the diaphragm however its distal aspect is obscured from

     History of TAA pain repair with intubation and line placements.
     
     Chest is rotated to the right.  Endotracheal tube is 3 cm above the carina. 
     Right jugular CV line is in proximal SVC.  NG tube is in stomach with distal
     end not included on film.  Curvilinear density overlying the right hemithorax
     is probably a skin fold, but this can be reevaluated on followup film.  There
     has been a reduction in the right-sided pleural effusion with minimal residual
     right effusion, and there are bibasilar atelectases as previously
     demonstrated.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Reduction in size of right pleural effusion.  Probable skinfold
     overlying right upper hemithorax for which followup film for reevaluation is
     suggested.  Bibasilar atelectases.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  70-year-old woman with descending aortic graft.
     
     COMPARISON:  CTA abdomen study of [**2804-7-16**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained prior to and following
     the administration of 150 cc Optiray.  Post contrast images of the
     chest were also obtained. Multiplanar reconstructions were obtained.  Delayed
     images of the abdomen and pelvis were also obtained.
     
     CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The airways are patent.  There is an NG tube seen
     coursing through the esophagus.  No pericardial effusion is seen.  There is a
     small left-sided pleural effusion.  There is atelectasis in the lingula as
     well as the areas of atelectasis in the left upper and lower lobes.  There is
     an area of ground-glass opacity in the right lower lobe.  It is nonspecific.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  The celiac trunk is markedly
     attenuated and there is marked attenuation of the common hepatic and splenic
     arteries.  There is a replaced right hepatic artery from the grafted superior
     mesenteric artery.  The superior mesenteric artery is markedly attenuated as
     well.  The left renal artery is thrombosed.  The inferior mesenteric artery is
     patent.  The portal and splenic veins are patent.  The right renal artery is
     patent.
     
     There is a marked diffuse low attenuation of the spleen indicating global
     infarction.  A similar appearance is for the left kidney, suggesting infarct.
     There are multiple low-attenuation regions throughout both lobes of the liver
     suggesting infarct as well.  The loops of small bowel are abnormally
     thickened indicative of bowel ischemia.
     
     At the proximal portion of the aortic graft, best seen on the axial delayed
     images, there is a small area of increased attenuation measuring approximately
     1.3 x 1.3 cm representing a small hematoma.  There are postsurgical changes
     surrounding the graft consisting of an area of low attenuation with rim
     enhancement; infection cannot be fully excluded.
     
     CT ARTERIOGRAM:  As explained above, there is marked attenuation of the celiac
     trunk as well as the superior mesenteric artery.  There is thrombosis within
     the left renal artery. The right renal artery is patent.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Multiplanar reconstructions confirm the above findings
     and very useful in making the diagnosis.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Marked attenuation in the caliber of the celiac trunk and the
     superior mesenteric artery.  There is thrombosis within the left renal artery.
     As a result, there is complete infarction of the left kidney, the spleen,
     multiple areas in both lobes of the liver as well as the loops of small bowel.
     Surrounding the proximal aortic graft, there is an area of relative low
     attenuation worrisome for infection with adjacent small hematoma.

     STUDY:  Venous duplex lower extremity.
     
     REASON:  Patient in need of bypass, evaluate for conduit.
     
     FINDINGS:  Duplex evaluation was performed of both greater saphenous veins. 
     Right greater saphenous vein has evidence of varicosity with chronic
     thrombosis at the level of the knee.  More proximally, the vein measures in
     diameter from 0.30-0.57 cm.  Distally _____ is patent in the calf that
     measures 0.27 cm.
     
     On the left, the proximal greater saphenous vein could not be evaluated due to
     a femoral line.  From the calf to the mid thigh, the diameter is 0.3, it
     becomes 0.26 and 0.26 respectively.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Patent bilateral greater saphenous veins with what appears to be
     a thrombosed portion of the mid segment on the right side and on the left, the
     proximal greater saphenous vein could not be evaluated due to a femoral line.

     COMPARISON:  [**2804-8-20**].
     
     CHEST AP:  There has been interval removal of the left-sided chest drain
     without evidence of pneumothorax.  An endotracheal tube is in place in
     unchanged position.  The tip of the nasogastric tube is in the stomach.  A
     left IJ catheter is again visualized with its tip in the mid SVC.  There is
     slight interval improvement of bilateral atelectasis and pleural effusions,
     right greater than left.  There are curvilinear densities in the left upper
     quadrant. These could represent sponge markers and clinical correlation is
     recommended.

     INDICATIONS:  69-year-old female status post abdominal aneurysm repair.  The
     patient is now status post change over the wire of central line.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made to radiograph performed on [**2804-8-23**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine single view of the chest.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a right IJ Quinton catheter with the tip in the upper SVC.
     There is a left IJ central line with the tip in the mid SVC.  There is no
     evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are
     stable.  There is interval development of severe upper lobe predominance dense
     alveolar opacity.  This most likely represents CHF.  Differential diagnosis
     would include massive aspiration.  The ET tube is in good position. There are
     skin staples overlying the left hemithorax.  There is an NG tube with the tip
     likely in the fundus of the stomach and in stable position.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Lines and tubes in appropriate position.
     2.  Interval development of severe upper lobe dense opacities, most likely
     representing pulmonary edema due to CHF.  Less likely, it could represent
     massive aspiration.  Clinical correlation recommended.
