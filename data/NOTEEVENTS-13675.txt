     CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 72-year-old male with intoxication and head injury.
     Assess placement of orogastric tube.
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST:
     
     Comparison is made to a study performed 6 hours prior.
     
     FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates 4 mm above the level of the carina.
     Orogastric tube courses well below the hemidiaphragm.  There are low lung
     volumes.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There is perihilar
     fullness and interstitial prominence, suggesting underlying edema.  There are
     more confluent opacities at the extreme lung bases, which could represent
     alveolar edema or atelectasis.  Aspiration is an additional consideration in a
     patient with the provided history.  There is no pneumothorax.  No fractures
     are identified within the visualized osseous structures.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Satisfactory positioning of orogastric tube.
     
     2)  Stable volume overload.
     
     3)  Unchanged confluent bibasilar opacities as above.  Differential
     considerations include dependent alveolar edema, atelectasis, or aspiration.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  72-year-old male with a traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage.
     
     COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to CT of the head performed on the same day at
     an outside hospital.  The images of the CT of the head from the outside
     hospital were only available to the resident in the Emergency Room.
     
     FINDINGS:  There are again noted, several very small foci of increased density
     in the left temporal and parietal periventricular white matter.  These
     findings most likely represent traumatic contusions or shear injury.  There
     is also a small amount of subarachnoid blood.
     The foci are unchanged when compared to the prior study.  There is no evidence
     of new hemorrhage.  There is no mass effect, shift of normally midline
     structures, or major vascular territorial infarcts.  The [**Doctor Last Name 63**]/white matter
     differentiation is preserved.  There is no hydrocephalus.
     
     Note that the NG tube is coiled in the mouth.  There is fluid in the bilateral
     maxillary sinuses (a small amount).  There is also thickening of the mucosa of
     the maxillary and ethmoid cells.  No fractures were seen.
     
     IMPRESSION
     1.  Subarachnoid hemorrhage and small parenchymal hemorrhages are unchanged
     when compared to the prior study.  There is no evidence of new hemorrhage.
     2.  The NG tube is coiled in the mouth of the patient.

     FINDINGS:  Examination of axial images demonstrates no evidence of cervical
     spine fracture.
     
     Sagittally and coronally reformatted images all demonstrate no evidence of
     cervical spine fracture, or significant alignment abnormalities.  There is no
     significant pervertebral soft tissue swelling.  Degenerative facet changes are
     seen at C2-C7.  Mild changes of uncovertebral proliferation are seen at C3-4.
     Both NG and endotracheal tube are seen.  Air-fluid levels are seen within the
     nasal pharynx.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Degenerative changes.  No evidence of cervical spine fracture.

     differentiation.  The extra-axial spaces appear unremarkable allowing for
     patient age.
     
     No fractures are seen.  There is left-sided parietal/temporal soft tissue
     hematoma with foci of air and varying densities, signifying blood of differing
     chronicity.  Air-fluid levels are seen within the sphenoid and maxillary
     sinuses, which can be seen in patient's with prolonged intubation.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.

     FINDINGS:
     
     Frontal view of the thoracic vertebral bodies reveals intact osseous
     structures with normal alignment.  There is no paravertebral soft tissue
     swelling.  The pedicles were well visualized and appear normal.
     
     Lateral projections are suboptimal and of little diagnostic utility.
     
     Additional images of the lumbar spine were obtained.  This shows the vertebral

     IMPRESSION:
     
     No features of fracture-dislocation, however, the lateral views of thoracic
     spine are inadequate for diagnostic purposes.  If there is clinical suspicion
     of thoracic vertebral body injury, CT scan is recommended.

Pt is 72y.o. male who fell backwards, striking back of head on curb of sidewalk.  Responding only to pain when arrived at Addison Hospital. Given narcan with no effect.  Intubated for airway protection.  ETOH 298. Also + for benzos, amphetamines and marijuana.  CT scan showed L SAH. Transferred to [**Hospital1 10**] for further management.  

PMH includes Pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, HTN, CAD, GERD, ETOH abuse, polysubstance abuse.  NKDA.  

Received pt to ICU on propofol drip for sedation, full vent support, v/s stable. Propofol drip stopped for baseline neuro exam--moving all extremites, following simple commands. Resedated. Aline placed with goal SBP established at <160---no intervention needed to meet this goal.  Taken for repeat CT head, CT  C-spine, TLS films this afternoon. Weaned to PS after films. Plan to keep sedated overnight. Hopeful extubation tomorrow.

REVIEW of SYSTEMS:

Neuro....Sedated on propofol drip. Easier to sedate earlier in shift. Once back from CT and placed on CPAP, pt requiring increasing doses of propofol to keep down--more restless, trying to sit up in bed, attempting to grab ETT. Currently up to 100mcg/kg/min.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 794**] aware. Takes Ativan at home--started on ativan around the clock  at 1745.  Arouses to voice, follows simple commands fairly consistently, i.e. show me tounge, squeeze hand, wiggle toes. Pupils equal and reactive--2-3mm.  Moving all extremites equally, very strong and purposeful.  Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 794**], CT of head done this afternoon, unchanged from admission CT.  CT spine and TLS films pending. Remains logroll.  

CV....NSR with no ectopy noted. HR 60-80's. Goal SBP <160. Easily attainable this am.  BP elevated this afternoon with increased restlessness/agiation.  See careview for specific trends. Still running <160.  LR at 125cc/hr.  

RESP...Stable ABG on CMV 600x16 peep5/60%.  Changed to PS 5/12/40% this afternoon. O2 sats 100%. RR elevated though, 30's.  Changed back to IMV at 1830.  Lung fields clear throughout.  Suctioning small amts of thick, yellow secretions.  

GI....NPO.  OGT to LCWS with small amts bilious drg.  Abd softly soft with hypoactive BS.  Pepcid coverage started.

GU...Adequate urine per foley cath.  Yellow, cloudy with some occasional sediment.  Mag repleted this am.  

ID....Tmax 99.6. No abx coverage.

HEME...Pneumo boots applied. HCT stable.  No subq heparin at this time.

ENDO...No coverage needed per RISS.  

SKIN....Abrasion to L occiput--mild swelling and small amt of serosang drg. Cleaned with NS.  Small, soft bump R forehead--?source. Backside intact. NO other skin issues.

SOCIAL....NO family contact. ED reports no family contact also. Will need to get SW involved tomorrow.  $427 found in pants pocket. Sent to security to lock up.

Respiratory Therapy
Pt remains orally intubated on full vent support. PSV trial attempted this PM, but pt agitated and difficult to medicate.  See resp flowsheet for specific vent data/changes.  BLBS slightly coarse, suctioned for small amounts of thick white sputum.  SpO2 remained 90s. Traveled to and from Radiology w/out incident for head CT, and T&L films.  ETT secure/patent.

Plan: maintain support; wean to extubate as tolerated

     rule out fracture or dislocation.
     
     Right foot, three views.  Left foot, two views.  Left ankle, two views.  No
     lateral view of the left ankle was obtained.  The technologist notes that the
     patient refused additional images.
     
     No localizing history is provided.
     
     RIGHT FOOT:  No true AP view is available.  There is severe diffuse
     osteopenia. No obvious fractures or erosions are identified, though a subtle
     fracture might not be evident on the available views. Similarly, it is
     somewhat difficult to assess for subtle erosion.  There are posterior and
     inferior calcaneal spurs. aspects of the calcaneus.   Small ossicle seen about
     the distal tibia posteriorly.
     
     LEFT FOOT:  There is severe hallux valgus deformity, with narrowing of the MTP
     joint and spurring and a bony bunion.  There is diffuse osteopenia.  No
     fractures identified.
     
     LEFT ANKLE:  No lateral view obtained.  There is enthesiophytic spurring about
     the medial and lateral malleoli.  A small ossicle projects over the medial
     aspect of the mortise joint.  No fracture or dislocation is detected on the
     views available.  No gouty erosions are identified.  Some bony buttressing is
     present medially, nonaggressive in appearance.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Limited exam.  No acute fracture.  If clinical suspicion for
     fracture remains high, then targeted views of the area of interest may help
     for further assessment.  Diffuse osteopenia.  No findings to support gout.
     Multifocal enthesiophytic spurring, which can be seen in the setting of
     spondyloarthropathy or could be an isolated finding.

     HISTORY:  Gout, now with bilateral foot and ankle pain.  Status post fall,
     rule out fracture or dislocation.
     
     Right foot, three views.  Left foot, two views.  Left ankle, two views.  No
     lateral view of the left ankle was obtained.  The technologist notes that the
     patient refused additional images.
     
     No localizing history is provided.
     
     RIGHT FOOT:  No true AP view is available.  There is severe diffuse
     osteopenia. No obvious fractures or erosions are identified, though a subtle
     fracture might not be evident on the available views. Similarly, it is
     somewhat difficult to assess for subtle erosion.  There are posterior and
     inferior calcaneal spurs. aspects of the calcaneus.   Small ossicle seen about
     the distal tibia posteriorly.
     
     LEFT FOOT:  There is severe hallux valgus deformity, with narrowing of the MTP
     joint and spurring and a bony bunion.  There is diffuse osteopenia.  No
     fractures identified.
     
     LEFT ANKLE:  No lateral view obtained.  There is enthesiophytic spurring about
     the medial and lateral malleoli.  A small ossicle projects over the medial
     aspect of the mortise joint.  No fracture or dislocation is detected on the
     views available.  No gouty erosions are identified.  Some bony buttressing is
     present medially, nonaggressive in appearance.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Limited exam.  No acute fracture.  If clinical suspicion for
     fracture remains high, then targeted views of the area of interest may help
     for further assessment.  Diffuse osteopenia.  No findings to support gout.
     Multifocal enthesiophytic spurring, which can be seen in the setting of
     spondyloarthropathy or could be an isolated finding.
