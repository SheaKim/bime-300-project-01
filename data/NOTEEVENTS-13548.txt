     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      53 year old woman with s/o left nephroureteral stent 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please change left nephroureteral stent
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  54-year-old woman with malignant obstruction of the left ureter.
     Nephroureteral stent placed on [**2593-9-24**].  The stent needs replacement.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Name5 (PTitle) 340**] & [**Doctor Last Name 85**].  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 85**],
     the attending radiologist, was present during the entire procedure.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  Only Lidocaine 1%, approximately 10 cc, was used.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed
     with the patient and informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought
     to the angiography suite and placed in prone position.  A scout view was
     obtained and demonstrates an 8 French 24-cm nephroureteral stent.
     Approximately 10 cc of Optiray 320 was then injected through the catheter and
     a tube nephrogram was obtained.  It demonstrates a nondilated collecting
     system with an obstruction of the mid ureter.  This obstruction is unchanged
     when compared to the prior studies.  The catheter was then cut to relieve the
     pigtail device.  A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 528**] wire was then introduced through the catheter
     into the urinary bladder. The catheter was removed over the wire.  A new 8
     French, 24-cm internal-external nephroureteral stent was then introduced over
     the wire. The pigtail devices were deployed.  An antegrade nephrostogram was
     then obtained and demonstrates the new catheter to be in appropriate position.
      Distal pigtail loop is located in the urinary bladder, while the proximal
     pigtail loop is located in the renal pelvis.  There is prompt emptying of
     contrast into the urinary bladder through the catheter.  The patient tolerated
     the procedure well and there were no complications.  The drain was attached to
     the skin with a 0-Prolene suture, and a Stat-lock device was applied.
     
     CONTRAST:  Approximately 30 cc of nonionic IV contrast was used.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful exchange of an 8 French, 24-cm internal-external
     nephroureteral stent.
                                                                 (Over)

     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Restage for colon cancer with left flank pain, question status of
     colon cancer after chemotherapy.
     
     COMPARISON: [**2593-9-16**]
     
     TECHNIQUE: MDCT non-contrast followed by contrast-enhanced images of the
     abdomen, with delayed images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis.  No
     reformations were performed.  Oral and IV Optiray non-ionic contrast were
     administered.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT/WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is minimal linear
     atelectasis at the right lung base and right upper lobe.  The lungs are
     otherwise clear.  The liver is unremarkable.  The gallbladder is not
     visualized.  There is a small area of soft tissue attenuation with central fat
     density in the left subhepatic recess, with minimal surrounding fat stranding.
     This is unchanged from the prior study, and may represent a small lipoma v. an
     epiploic appendage.  The spleen and pancreas are unremarkable. There are
     multiple tiny mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, the largest in the
     periaortic region, measuring 8 mm, slightly smaller than the previous study.
     No new pathologically enlarged lymphadenopathy is identified.
      There is no free fluid or air within the abdomen.  Again identified, is a
     large heterogeneous mass centered in the descending colon, and invading the
     psoas muscle, unchanged and appearance from the previous study.  There has
     been interval placement of a percutaneous left sided ureteral stent, in good
     anatomic position.  There is mild periureteral stranding, however no evidence
     of urinary tract obstruction or hydronephrosis.
     
     CT PELVIS WITHOUT/WITH IV CONTRAST:  No contrast was seen to flow distal to
     the large descending colon mass, however there is no proximal bowel dilation
     to indicate bowel obstruction.  The more distal bowel is unremarkable.  There
     is no free air or air within the pelvis.  There is no evidence of
     pathologically enlarged lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are detected.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Unchanged size and appearance of large heterogeneous mass centered on the
     descending colon and invading the psoas muscle, likely represent recurrent
     colon cancer.
                                                                 (Over)

     French, 24-cm internal-external nephroureteral stent was then introduced over
     the wire. The pigtail devices were deployed.  An antegrade nephrostogram was
     then obtained and demonstrates the new catheter to be in appropriate position.
      Distal pigtail loop is located in the urinary bladder, while the proximal
     pigtail loop is located in the renal pelvis.  There is prompt emptying of
     contrast into the urinary bladder through the catheter.  The patient tolerated
     the procedure well and there were no complications.  The drain was attached to
     the skin with a 0-Prolene suture, and a Stat-lock device was applied.
     
     CONTRAST:  Approximately 30 cc of nonionic IV contrast was used.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  54-year-old woman with malignant obstruction of the left ureter.
     Nephroureteral stent placed on [**2593-9-24**].  The stent needs replacement.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Name5 (PTitle) 340**] & [**Doctor Last Name 85**].  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 85**],
     the attending radiologist, was present during the entire procedure.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  Only Lidocaine 1%, approximately 10 cc, was used.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed
     with the patient and informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought
     to the angiography suite and placed in prone position.  A scout view was
     obtained and demonstrates an 8 French 24-cm nephroureteral stent.
     Approximately 10 cc of Optiray 320 was then injected through the catheter and
     a tube nephrogram was obtained.  It demonstrates a nondilated collecting
     system with an obstruction of the mid ureter.  This obstruction is unchanged
     when compared to the prior studies.  The catheter was then cut to relieve the
     pigtail device.  A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 528**] wire was then introduced through the catheter
     into the urinary bladder. The catheter was removed over the wire.  A new 8

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted on day of surgery. She tolerated the procedure well 
and was transferred to the SICU post-operatively, as she 
remained intubated. She was extubated on [**1-11**], and continued to 
do well. On [**1-12**], it was noted that her hematocrit had dropped 
to 23 from 30, and she was transfused 2 Units. No source of 
bleeding was found after extensive examination. Pt's SICU course 
was otherwise uneventful, and she was transferred to the floor 
on [**1-14**]. Here she continued to do well, with stable crits, vital 
signs, and a generally reassuring course. ALthough the output 
from her [**Location (un) 767**]-[**Location (un) 1527**] drain remained elevated, the creatinine 
of this fluid was reassuring that there was no urine leak, and 
the drain was removed. She began tolerating oral intake on [**1-16**], 
and by [**1-18**] was doing very well. She was discharged home with 
services, and instructed to return to clinic for follow up.

     HISTORY:  A 54-year-old woman with history of retroperitoneal mass status post
     low anterior resection and resection of mass.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2593-12-24**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector axial images were obtained from the lung apices to
     the pubic symphysis with oral and IV contrast.  150 Ml Optiray.
     
     CT chest with IV contrast:  There is no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar
     lymphadenopathy.  The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are within normal
     limits.  No pulmonary nodules are identified.  Atelectasis and scarring in the
     right lower lobe is again noted.  There are no pleural or pericardial
     effusions.
     
     CT abdomen without and with IV contrast:  The liver, pancreas, spleen, adrenal
     glands, and right kidney,  and bowel loops are within normal limits.  There
     has been removal of the left NU stent.  There is prominence of the left ureter
     but no hydronephrosis is seen.  Contrast is observed passing into the bladder.
     There is no free air or free fluid.  There has been interval increase in size
     of multiple retroperitoneal and portal nodes.  Several of these nodes adjacent
     to the aorta and IVC measure over 10 mm in short axis.
     
     CT pelvis with IV contrast:  The bladder and distal bowel are within normal
     limits.  Some residual stranding is noted at the left retroperitoneal
     resection site.  No definite enhancing lesion is identified at this location.
     Prominent nodes are noted at the aortic bifurcation.  There is no free fluid
     and no inguinal lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.

     STUDY:  CT chest, abdomen and pelvis.
     
     INDICATION:  Metastatic colon cancer, follow up progression.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector acquired axial images from the thoracic inlet to the
     pubic symphysis were displaced with 5-mm slice thickness with no constrast and
     multi-phasic contrast imaging.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  No pleural effusions, nodules, or opacities are
     present at the lung bases.  The liver appears normal with no masses
     identified.  The pancreas and spleen, adrenal glands appear normal.  There is
     a small 1.5-cm lesion in the left posterior inferior aspect of the kidney that
     demonstrates wall enhancement and an irregular wall.  Compared to previous
     study 3 months ago, there is growth of this lesion from 1 cm to 2cm. The small
     and large bowel is unchanged from previous study. There is an incidental note
     of an epiploic appendage in the transverse colon that is also present on
     previous study.  There are no masses in the left lower quadrant identified.
     There is some lymphadenopathy present within the abdomen, but all lymph nodes
     have decreased in size compared to [**2594-3-20**]. There is no free fluid.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The distal large bowel is unchanged from
     comparison study.  The bladder is normal.  The uterus is not well visualized.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  The osseous structures are unremarkable.  There are no bone
     lesions noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Improved lymphadenopathy, no new pathology noted in left lower quadrant.
     
     2.  2cm left renal lesion increased in size in comparison to the prior study.
     This is concerning for renal cell carcinoma and could be further evaluated
     with MRI.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      54 year old woman with met. colon ca and left renal mass.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      left kidney mass noted on prior ct and mri suggested
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Left kidney mass noted on prior CT scan.  Metastatic colon
     cancer.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT torso [**2594-3-20**], and [**2594-7-30**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted gadolinium-enhanced MR of the
     abdomen with 3D subtraction images and multiplanar workstation reformatted
     images.
     
     FINDINGS:  The left kidney is partially malrotated.  At the lower pole of the
     left kidney medially, there is a 1.1 x 1.2 x 1.3 cm lesion which is low signal
     on T2-weighted images, similar in signal to the renal parenchyma on T1 images,
     does not drop signal on out-of phase images, and which demonstrates thin
     peripheral enhancement without internal septation or nodularity following
     gadolinium administration.  This is consistent with a cyst and does not
     demonstrate any concerning features.  The size of the lesion on today's exam
     is similar to that seen on the CT torso of [**2594-3-20**], and is unlikely to
     have grown in the interval.  The apparent increase in size on the CT torso
     from [**2594-7-30**], may relate to differences in position due to respiratory
     motion.  The remainder of the left kidney appears normal.  The right kidney
     appears normal.
     
     There is a tiny T2 bright lesion within the right lobe of the liver, which
     does not enhance and is consistent with a simple cyst.  The liver is not
     completely imaged on this exam, but no other lesions are seen.  The spleen,
     pancreas, adrenal glands, and biliary tree are within normal limits.  The
     gallbladder is not visualized.  There is some fluid adjacent to the tail of
     the pancreas.  A small retrocrural nodule on the left measuring 8 x 14 mm is
     noted, corresponding to a small soft tissue nodule on the prior study, and may
     represent a lymph node.  Small paraaortic nodes are also noted which do not
     meet strict criteria for pathologic enlargement.  The aorta is normal in
     caliber.  There is no free peritoneal fluid.  The osseous structures are
     grossly unremarkable.
     
     3D subtraction images and workstation reformatted images were essential in
     assessing the left renal lesion.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  11 x 12 x 13 mm nodule at the lower pole of the left kidney with thin
     enhancing rim, but without internal architecture, nodular enhancement, or
     septation.  This is consistent with a cyst, and is unchanged in size compared
                                                                 (Over)

     HISTORY:  Follow up colon cancer.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2594-7-30**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial images through the abdomen prior to and following
     administration of IV contrast.  Axial contrast images through the chest and
     pelvis.  Multiplanar reformats were performed.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There are no pathologically enlarged axillary,
     hilar, or mediastinal lymph nodes.  The great vessels and heart are normal. 
     There are no pulmonary nodules.  There is an area of thickening along the left
     major fissure.  There are no pleural or pericardial effusions.  The airways
     are patent to the level of the subsegmental bronchi bilaterally.  There is
     also thickening along the right major fissure.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST.  There is a small low
     attenuation at the dome of the liver, and another within the right lobe, too
     small to characterize, but unchanged.  The spleen, right kidney, pancreas, and
     both adrenal glands are normal.  The gallbladder is not identified.  There is
     an area of low attenuation, approximately 1 cm in the left kidney, consistent
     with the cyst seen on the recent MRI.  There is normal-appearing small bowel. 
     There is evidence of stable stranding within the left abdomen, in the region
     of prior surgery.  There is no free air or free fluid.  There are stable 5 mm
     left paraaortic lymph nodes.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There is a 2 x 2 cm soft tissue mass on
     series 3, image 89 adjacent to the distal descending, proximal sigmoid colon. 
     This measures 2 x 2 cm, and likely represents a lymph node.  The remainder of
     the large and small bowel are unremarkable.  There is no free fluid.  There
     are no pathologically enlarged inguinal lymph nodes.  The bladder is normal. 
     The uterus and ovaries are not identified.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  New 2 cm soft tissue mass adjacent to the distal descending/proximal
     sigmoid colon, likely representing lymphadenopathy and concerning for disease
     recurrence.
     2.  Left renal lesion consistent with the recent MRI which showed a cyst.  Dr.

     attenuation at the dome of the liver, and another within the right lobe, too
     small to characterize, but unchanged.  The spleen, right kidney, pancreas, and
     both adrenal glands are normal.  The gallbladder is not identified.  There is
     an area of low attenuation, approximately 1 cm in the left kidney, consistent
     with the cyst seen on the recent MRI.  There is normal-appearing small bowel. 
     There is evidence of stable stranding within the left abdomen, in the region
     of prior surgery.  There is no free air or free fluid.  There are stable 5 mm
     left paraaortic lymph nodes.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There is a 2 x 2 cm soft tissue mass on
     series 3, image 89 adjacent to the distal descending, proximal sigmoid colon. 
     This measures 2 x 2 cm, and likely represents a lymph node.  The remainder of
     the large and small bowel are unremarkable.  There is no free fluid.  There
     are no pathologically enlarged inguinal lymph nodes.  The bladder is normal. 
     The uterus and ovaries are not identified.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  New 2 cm soft tissue mass adjacent to the distal descending/proximal
     sigmoid colon, likely representing lymphadenopathy and concerning for disease
     recurrence.
     2.  Left renal lesion consistent with the recent MRI which showed a cyst.  Dr.

                                                                 (Over)
