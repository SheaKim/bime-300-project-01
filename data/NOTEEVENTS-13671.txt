     INDICATION:  Found unresponsive and intubated.
     
     AP CHEST:  There is an ET tube with the tip 4 cm from the carina.  An NG tube
     has been placed with the tip in the fundus of the stomach.  Overall there is a
     shallow inspiration and low lung volumes.  Given that, the cardiac silhouette,
     hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There is mild linear
     opacity in the lingula that likely represents atelectasis.  There is
     prominence of the pulmonary vascularity centrally however this is most likely
     due to the patient's supine position.  No definite infiltrates are seen.
     There are no effusions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Status post intubation and NG tube placement with appropriate positions.
     2.  Linear opacity in the lingula likely represents atelectasis.

     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST: CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:
     
     TECHNIQUE: Pre-and-post contrast abdomen and post contrast pelvis was
     performed following administration of 150cc of Optiray for indication of
     multiple allergies.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST: There is bilateral dependent atelectasis
     vs small consolidation in the lung bases. There is a small hiatal hernia.
     There are no pleural effusions.  Precontrast hepatic Hounsfelds of 42 [**Doctor Last Name **]
     suggest mild fatty replacement, consistent with hepatitis.  Although the post
     contrast attenuation of the liver is somewhat heterogeneous, there are no
     focal lesions.  There is no evidence of biliary obstruction.  Increased
     attenuation of the bile within the gallbladder is consistent with vicarious
     excretion from previous contrast enhanced CT. There are several enlarged lymph
     nodes within the portahepatis which are consistent with hepatitis.  The
     pancreas, spleen, adrenals, kidneys and abdominal bowel loops are normal in
     appearance. There is no ascites.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The kidneys enhance symmetrically.  There is a foley
     catheter within the bladder.  Contrast reaches the rectum without evidence of
     obstruction.  There is a right iliac vessel catheter.  There is no pelvic
     lymphadenopathy or free fluid.
     
     Bone windows reveal no suspicious osseous lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION: Fatty liver and portahepatis lymphadenopathy.  No evidence of
     pancreatitis or intraabdominal hemorrhage.
