with questions 
INDICATION: A distant history of gastric bezoar with nausea and 
vomiting after transverse colectomy. Please evaluate gastric 
emptying.

COMPARISON: None.

FINDINGS: A focussed fluoroscopic study of the stomach was 
performed. Patient was orally administered a thin barium, which 
demonstrated free passage through the esophagus into the 
stomach. There is no evidence for hiatal hernia. There was 
significant reflux with a large column of contrast refluxing 
into the esophagus to the upper mediastinum. This was 
accompanied by dysfunctional tertiary peristaltic waves. 
Esophageal lumen is featureless with a small diverticulum noted 
in the mid portion of the esophagus. The patient was kept in the 
fluoroscopic suite for 20 minutes without opacification of the 
stomach antrum. Given a large column of reflux of contrast, a 
decision was made not to administer fizzies for stomach 
dilation. Study will be continued on the floor with subsequent 
portable abdominal radiograph to assess gastric emptying. 
Three-lead pacemaker is noted with leads coursing their 
anticipated paths. Surgical clips are present in the right upper 
quadrant, midline, as well as skin staples present along the 
midline. Contrast is present within the colon from a previous 
contrast study.

Abdominal supine portable radiograph performed one hour after 
thin barium administration demonstrates unchanged appearance of 
contrast in the stomach. Contrast in the colon is from a prior 
study.

Abdominal supine portable radiographs performed two hours after 
thin barium administration demonstrates contrast opacification 
of non-distended stomach. Contrast has progressed into the 
duodenum and proximal jejunum.

IMPRESSION:
1. Marked esopphageal reflux with large column of barium 
persisting in esophagus to the upper mediastinum (exam performed 
in near upright position). Patient is at risk for aspiration. 
Small mid-esophageal diverticulum.

2. Contrast passage through non-dilated normal-appearing stomach 
demonstrated two hours post contrast administration.

PELVIC ULTRASOUND.

INDICATION: Nausea, vomiting, and fever, status post transverse 
colectomy.

COMPARISON: [**3358-8-14**].
Since the prior examination, there has been interval removal of 
the enteric tube. Stable appearance of the left-sided central 
venous catheter with its tip projecting over the SVC. Slight 
increased opacity in the right lung base may represent a 
possible consolidation. Stable appearance of the left lower lobe 
opacification. Left-sided dual chamber pacemaker is unchanged 
with the presence of an abandoned lead from prior device. The 
upper abdomen demonstrates gas fluid level and barium layering 
in a slight dilated stomach. Some of the contrast exited the 
stomach, but cannot be assessed.

IMPRESSION: Possible consolidation in both lung bases, 
particularly in the right. Interval removal of the enteric tube. 
Large amount of residual contrast layering in the stomach with 
at least some in the small bowel

[**Doctor First Name **] 

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
86 year old man with [**Last Name (un) **]-jejunal tube that is clogged. 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please change over a wire and replace NJ tube.*30259 [**Doctor First Name **] 
INDICATIONS: 86-year-old man with clogged nasojejunal tube.

TECHNIQUE: Placement of feeding tube under fluoroscopy.

FINDINGS: A 14 French [**Doctor First Name 1057**]-[**Location (un) 4880**] nasointestinal feeding 
tube was passed into the stomach without difficulty, and the 
existing tube removed. However, attempts to pass the tube beyond 
the stomach were not successful. A redundant segment was left in 
the stomach in order to potentially facilitate distal passage. 
Persistent debris in the fundus of the stomach is noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. Placement of feeding tube within the stomach. The tube could 
not be advanced into the jejunum (the patient is s/p BillrothII) 
. It could be helpful to acquire an abdominal radiograph in the 
morning, and if the tube does not spontaneously pass into the 
jejunum by that time, the patient could be returned to the 
fluoroscopy suite for repositioning.

2. Persistent debris within the fundus of the stomach.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
86M s/p bilroth 2, with delayed gastric emptying & need for 
feeding tube. 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please place GJ tube tube with G port to vent stomach & J port 
into efferent jejnual limb for tube feedings... 
HISTORY: Gastric outlet obstruction in a patient with a Billroth 
II procedure. Please place GJ tube.

TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: After informed consent was obtained, the 
patient's anterior abdominal wall was prepped and draped in a 
sterile fashion. Insufflation of the patient's current NG tube 
was performed in conjunction with review of a recent CT scan. 
This demonstrated the gastric remnant to be of decent size and 
directly below the anterior abdominal wall. Hence, after 
insufflation, two T-fasteners were placed along the greater 
curvature of the stomach, after which the Seldinger technique 
was used to place a 5 French sheath within the gastric remnant 
lumen. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5606**] wire and Kumpe catheter were used to manipulate 
into the patient's efferent loop. This loop was confirmed both 
with contrast and passage of a 150-cm wire. The catheter-wire 
combination were manipulated approximately 100 cm into the 
efferent limb, after which the wire was exchanged for an Amplatz 
wire. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1230**]-Coons gastrojejunostomy tube was shortened 
(regularly 100 cm, shortened to approximately 80 cm) with 
additional sideholes placed and then advanced into the efferent 
limb after tract dilatation. The proximal port which is for 
gastric aspiration, was left within the gastric remnant, the 
distal port, 80 cm in the efferent limb for tube feeding. The 
tube was sutured in place with 0-Prolene. As well, it contains a 
mushroom tip for internal anchoring.

IMPRESSION: Placement of a double-lumen gastrojejunostomy tube 
via this patient's gastric remnant, proximal port within the 
remnant, distal port approximately 80 cm within the efferent 
limb in this patient who is status post a Billroth II procedure. 
No complications.

AP CHEST 9:40 A.M. [**9-5**].

HISTORY: Nausea, vomiting and fever following transverse 
colectomy. Respiratory distress.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**8-14**] through [**9-4**]:

Moderate pulmonary edema best demonstrated in the perihilar left 
lung has developed since [**9-4**]. There is consolidation in 
both lower lungs, particularly the right, strongly suggestive of 
concurrent pneumonia. Accompanying small-to-moderate right 
pleural effusion could be related to either development. Heart 
is at least moderately enlarged partially obscured by 
right-sided consolidation. There is no pneumothorax.

Two transvenous right ventricular and one right atrial pacer 
lead are unchanged in their respective positions originating in 
the left axillary pacemaker. A right central line probably a 
PICC can be traced as far as the junction of the brachiocephalic 
veins.

Findings were discussed by telephone with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to [**Hospital1 19**] on [**3358-8-9**] for nausea and vomitting 
since recent surgery. He has been unable to take a regular diet 
since that time. 

He continued to be nausea. A PICC line was put in and TPN 
started. He subsequently developed a fever and increased WBC. 
The PICC was then removed. Blood cultures from [**8-13**] grew Staph 
form one bottle only. He was started on Vancomycin, but then 
this was D/C'd on [**8-15**] when other cultures did not reveal any 
growth.

GI: A NGT was placed on [**8-13**]. Very foul smelling output from NG 
(only 75-100 cc). It was thought that the efferent limb of 
billroth is twisted due to recent surgery.  
CT showed oral contrast going down ok. An EGD, down 20-30 cm in 
efferent limb, showed no stricture or obstruction. A SBFT showed 
marked esophageal reflux with large column of barium persisting 
in esophagus to the upper mediastinum (exam performed in near 
upright position). Regland was started. An EGD on [**3358-8-21**] was 
performed with dilation, injection, NJ feeding tube placement. 
He was then started on tube feedings. The tube became clogged 
and it was then decided to place a GJ tube for nutritional 
support. His tubefeedings were slowly advanced to goal over the 
next few days. 

Geriatrics: [**Female First Name (un) **] was consulted to help manage the care of this 
86 year old gentleman. He was depressed and discouraged. He was 
started back on his home med of Zoloft. Other recommmendations 
were to D/C Ibuprofen and give Tylenol.

Psych: Psych was consulted for his obvious depression and for 
thought of harming himself. He was switched from Zoloft to 
Celexa. His mood improved after be able to provide nutrition.

Endo: [**Last Name (un) 720**] was consulted for elevated blood sugars. He needed 
15 Units Humalog for a blood sugar on 430 on [**3358-8-18**]. His 
sliding scale was adjusted and his sugars were in better 
control.

Renal: He was ordered for Lasix 40 mg IV BID for LE edema and 
pleural effusion.

Cardiology: He was noted to have A fib on routine ECG. His pacer 
was interrogation and shows A fib since early this month. He was 
on his beta blocker. All cardiac enzymes tested were negative.   


Musculoskeletal: He complained of joint pain and aches. He was 
ordered for Tylenol and put back on his Allopurinol and 
Colchicine.

Resp: On [**3358-9-5**], the patient was found by the nurses to be 
conscious, but not responding. His O2 sats were in the 70's, he 
was tachypenic, his lungs sounds were wet. It was thought that 
due to development of pneumonia, his respiratory status was 
compromised and he most likely aspirated. Secretions were 
suctioned from his oralpharynx and a NGT was placed to relieve 
any gastric content. He vommited a small amount of foul smelling 
brownish gastric contents. He was transfered to the SICU and 
placed on BIPAP support. He was DNR/DNI and so was not 
intubated. His family was notified and he was made CMO. He 
expired on [**3358-9-6**].

Radiology:
[**8-10**] Abd Xray - No evidence of obstruction.
[**8-10**] Chest Xray - Bilateral pleural effusions
[**8-13**] Abd CT - Large right and small-to-moderate left pleural 
effusions, small amount of free air within the abdomen and 
subcutaneous tissues adjacent to incision site, likely 
postoperative sequelae, small amount of fat stranding 
surrounding anastomotic site, consistent with postoperative 
sequelae. No focal fluid collection is identified. Contrast is 
seen passing this site, no evidence of bowel leak or 
obstruction.
[**8-14**] US Lower Ext - No evidence of DVT bilaterally.
[**8-15**] Abd X-ray - Contrast remains within the stomach. No 
evidence of obstruction 
[**8-16**] Chest Xray - Possible consolidation in both lung bases, 
particularly in the right. Interval removal of the enteric tube. 
Large amount of residual contrast layering in the stomach with 
at least some in the small bowel
[**8-20**] CXR - Bilateral loculated effusions, right much larger than 
left.

                               [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1242**] [**Name8 (MD) 1243**], M.D. (supervising staff).
     
     DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  Timeout was performed to identify the patient, the
     procedure to be performed, the site of the procedure, and appropriate
     requisition.  Once the above were accomplished, the patient was positioned in
     supine fashion on a special procedures/angiography table with the right arm
     abducted and externally rotated.  The right arm in turn was prepped and draped
     from the axilla to the antecubital fossa.  Tourniquet was applied to the upper
     arm.  Ultrasound was used to assess the veins of the upper arm.  The right
     brachial vein was selected for venipuncture. The skin was infiltrated with
     approximately 2-3 cc of 1% Xylocaine for local anesthesia.  Uneventful one-
     wall venipuncture was achieved under ultrasound guidance using a 21-gauge
     micropuncture needle.  (Hard copy sonographic images of the venipuncture were
     obtained in hard copy fashion.) The guide wire was advanced by way of the
     access needle and steered to the superior vena cava under fluoroscopic
     visualization.  The intravascular length of the catheter was determined.  The
     catheter was tailored at the 37-cm mark and delivered using modified Seldinger
     technique to the level of the caudal superior vena cava.  Once satisfactory
     positioning was confirmed, both lumens of the catheter were flushed and
     heparin locked.  The catheter was statlocked and positioned for security.  The
     catheter and puncture access site were overlaid with a Tegaderm occlusive
     dressing.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  No immediate
     complications were encountered.  Estimated blood loss was minimal.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Status post successful placement of 5 French dual-lumen PICC line via
     right brachial vein approach.  Final catheter length is 37 cm.  Tip position
     is in caudal superior vena cava.  Catheter is ready to employ.

     INDICATION:  86-year-old male with poor nutrition.
     
     RADIOLOGIST:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 6641**] [**Name (STitle) 7907**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1774**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 216**], the attending
     radiologist, who was present throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The patient was brought to the angiography table.
     Right upper arm was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Ultrasound
     was used to identify right brachial vein, which was patent and compressible.
     Pre- and post-ultrasound images obtained.  Under ultrasound guidance, right
     brachial vein was punctured, and 0.018-guidewire was inserted over the needle.
     Needle was exchanged with peel-away sheath, and 31 cm 5 French double lumen
     PICC line was inserted over the wire using flouroscopic guidance, with the tip
     terminating in distal SVC. Peel-away sheath is removed, the wire is removed.
     The line was flushed, capped, and heplocked.  The line was finally StatLocked.
     The final fluoroscopic image was obtained to confirm the location of the line.
     The patient tolerated the procedure without any immediate complication.  The
     line is ready for use.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of 31 cm 5 French double lumen PICC line
     with the tip terminating in distal SVC from right brachial vein.  The line is
     ready for use.

     HISTORY:  Gastric outlet obstruction in a patient with a Billroth II
     procedure.  Please place GJ tube.
     
     TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  After informed consent was obtained, the patient's
     anterior abdominal wall was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. 
     Insufflation of the patient's current NG tube was performed in conjunction
     with review of a recent CT scan.  This demonstrated the gastric remnant to be
     of decent size and directly below the anterior abdominal wall.  Hence, after
     insufflation, two T-fasteners were placed along the greater curvature of the
     stomach, after which the Seldinger technique was used to place a 5 French
     sheath within the gastric remnant lumen.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 193**] wire and Kumpe catheter
     were used to manipulate into the patient's efferent loop.  This loop was
     confirmed both with contrast and passage of a 150-cm wire.  The catheter-wire
     combination were manipulated approximately 100 cm into the efferent limb,
     after which the wire was exchanged for an Amplatz wire.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3068**]-Coons
     gastrojejunostomy tube was shortened (regularly 100 cm, shortened to
     approximately 80 cm) with additional sideholes placed and then advanced into
     the efferent limb after tract dilatation.  The proximal port which is for
     gastric aspiration, was left within the gastric remnant, the distal port, 80
     cm in the efferent limb for tube feeding.  The tube was sutured in place with
     0-Prolene.  As well, it contains a mushroom tip for internal anchoring.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Placement of a double-lumen gastrojejunostomy tube via this
     patient's gastric remnant, proximal port within the remnant, distal port
     approximately 80 cm within the efferent limb in this patient who is status
     post a Billroth II procedure.  No complications.
