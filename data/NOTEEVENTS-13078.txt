Date of Birth:   [**3028-9-2**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

ADDENDUM TO HOSPITAL COURSE:  Repeated attempts of low-dose
Captopril resulted in hypotension, and the patient was
restarted on her beta blocker.  She tolerated a dose of 3.125
of Carvedilol b.i.d., and this should be continued as an
outpatient.  She was started on digoxin for her congestive
heart failure and had a dose of 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. without a
load.  Her levels should be followed-up as an outpatient by
her primary care provider.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] diuretic dosage was increased
to Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. with spironolactone 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d. for maintaining her volume status.  This dose may be
adjusted as an outpatient as needed.

ADDENDUM TO INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient completed a ten
day course of dicloxacillin and levofloxacin and remained
afebrile with a normal white count at the time of discharge.

PULMONARY:  The patient's oxygenation status remained stable
on her home oxygen requirements of 4 liters by nasal cannula.
Physical Therapy recommended home oxygen with 4 liters by
nasal cannula at rest and 5 liters with activity.

PSYCHIATRY:  The patient was evaluated by psychiatric
consultation, who recommended continuing Celexa and Remeron
and avoiding benzodiazepines for anxiety symptoms.  They
recommend follow-up with outpatient psychiatry and
discontinuation of Seroquel.

DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged in stable condition
to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Congestive heart failure.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Diabetes mellitus.
4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Anxiety disorder.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Carvedilol 3.125 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Atorvostatin 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Spironolactone 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6.  Glipizide XL 5 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Mirtazapine 15 mg p.o. q.h.s.
9.  Celexa 30 mg p.o. q.d.
10. Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers p.r.n.
11. Flovent four puffs p.o. b.i.d.
12. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
13. Dulcolax 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n.

DISCHARGE PLAN:
1.  The patient should follow-up with her primary care
provider in one to two weeks.
2.  The patient should have her blood drawn for a digoxin
level and panel 7 within one week and have these results
faxed to her primary care provider, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], at
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 8493**].
3.  The patient should consider following up with an
outpatient cardiologist if her primary care provider, [**Name10 (NameIs) 4557**] is
listed as a cardiologist, is not comfortable with managing
her heart failure symptoms.

     HISTORY: 60 year old woman with CHF, evaluate line placement.
     
     COMPARISON: [**3089-6-7**]  at 5:51 AM.
     
     AP PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Interval placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter via
     the right IJ with its tip in the right main pulmonary artery.  No pneumothorax
     identified.  The endotracheal tube remains in satisfactory position,
     approximagely 4 cm from the carina.  Again seen is a right sided pleural
     effusion with redistribution of the pulmonary vascularity consistent with
     cardiac failure.  The heart size is enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar
     contours are unchanged in the interval.  Again seen is a retrocardiac
     density,unchanged. The lungs are hyperinflated.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Continued cardiac failure.
     2) Stable appearance of lines and tubes with no pneumothorax.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Peripheral edema and worsened pulmonary status, status post
     intubation.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest is compared with the prior
     study from 8 hours ago.
     
     FINDINGS:  There has been interval intubation, with tip of the endotracheal
     tube in the thoracic inlet.  This may represent the area of intubation.  Again
     seen are marked pulmonary markings, which are indeterminate in nature but may
     represent some aspect of mixed interstitial/alveolar manifestations of
     failure.  The right sided pleural effusion remains quite prominent, and there
     the left sided pleural effusion is much less apparent due to supine patient
     positioning Cardiac silhouette is unremarkable.  There may be some
     retrocardiac atelectasis/consolidation. There is an area of linear atelectasis
     at the right lung base.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Appropriate placement of ETT, tip 5 cm from the carina.

     HISTORY:  60 year old woman with congestive heart failure, evaluate
     endotracheal tube placement.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3089-6-9**].
     
     AP SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The endotracheal tube is at the thoracic
     inlet, in satisfactory and stable position.  There is a Swan-Ganz catheter via
     the right IJ whose tip terminates in the right mid pulmonary artery.  No
     pneumothorax is identified.  An NG tube is seen, which is coiled in the
     stomach, however, it's tip is in the distal stomach and beyond the edge of the
     radiograph.  The heart size is enlarged with LV predominance and bilateral
     pleural effusions.  The pulmonary vascularity shows signs of upper-zone
     redistribution consistent with congestive heart failure, however, it has
     improved compared to the prior study.  In addition, there are possible
     bibasilar infiltrates.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. No pneumothorax.  Lines and tubes in satisfactory position.
     2. Improving congestive heart failure.
     3. Possible bibasilar infiltrates.

     AP CHEST:  In comparison to the prior study of [**3089-6-12**], the right PA
     catheter is in unchanged position, terminating in an intralobar right
     pulmonary artery division.  The heart size and mediastinal and hilar contours
     are stable and within normal limits.  Hyperinflation of the lungs is
     consistent with underlying emphysema.  Mild pulmonary vascular redistribution
     is unchanged, as is the small right pleural effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Stable mild  CHF.
