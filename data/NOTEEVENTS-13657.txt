Chief Complaint:
change in mental status x several days
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Stereotactic brain biopsy of left frontopariental mass
 
History of Present Illness:
72 yo woman with history of cervical cancer s/p resection, 
radiation,
complications from radiation 2005 and resulting R nephrectomy,
cystectomy and ileostomy, chronic renal insufficiency, anemia, 
recurrent UTIs with MRSA, who presents as transfer from [**Known patient firstname 276**] 
Hospital with brain mass,
discovered after 2nd presentation for change in mental status. 
Per notes from [**Known patient firstname 276**] Hospital, she had been admitted there 
from elderly housing with altered mental status and had 
apparently said ""I haven't felt like myself"" - no further 
details are provided about mental status, but it appears that 
urinalysis was positive, and she was discharged the following 
day on Levaquin.  (Incidentally, Urine culture shows Pseudomonas 
resistant to Levaquin.)  She returned home and
was sent back to [**Known patient firstname 276**] emergency room with continued altered 
mental
status. Head CT was performed, and showed large L 
fronto-parietal brain mass with shift of midline structures.  
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] ER.  Her son, [**Doctor First Name 4137**], is her health 
care proxy, per paperwork. 
.
She denies all other neurologic problems, including weakness, 
numbness, confusion, dysarthria, dysphagia, diplopia or visual 
problems, headache or any pain anywhere.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9479**] was admitted to the neurology intensive care unit 
and started on Decadron 4mg q6hr to reduce vasoigenic edema 
surrounding the left front-parietal mass. Zosyn was started for 
positive urinalysis for urinary tract infection; it should 
continue for a 10 day course until after [**1-29**]. 

Brain biopsy was preliminarily positive for glioblastoma. She 
will follow with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 737**] of neuro-oncology for treatment 
determination.

Her mental status improved after initiation of steroids. She 
returned to her baseline, with only mild anomia and right-sided 
hemiparesis on exam. She is not demented at baseline and her 
change in behavior on admission was instead related to her tumor 
and possible seizures. She should continue on keppra 1000/1000 
for seizure prophylaxis.

The patient's son is involved in her care. He will discuss with 
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 737**] what treatment she will undertake (likely cyberknife).

She should be intermittently monitored for UTI, with urine 
culture, as she is colonized with pseudomonas.

     REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fever.
     
     Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed.  There is no previous film
     available for comparison.
     
     The heart size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous and partially calcified.  The
     right upper mediastinum is slightly widened with smooth border most likely due
     to dilated vessels.  The lungs are essentially clear.  The left retrocardiac
     linear opacities may represent either fibrosis or scarring.  There is no
     sizable pleural effusion.
     
     Old fracture of the left femoris is noted as well as bilateral severe
     degenerative changes of the glenohumeral joint.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Pre-MRI screening.
     
     AP and lateral views of the skull show metallic densities associated with an
     oral prosthesis.  There is no evidence of intraorbital metallic foreign body.
     
     AP view of the cervical spine show scoliosis of upper thoracic spine.  There
     is no evidence of metallic density to suggest the presence of a vagal nerve
     stimulator.
     
     A supine view of the chest shows the upper thoracic scoliosis.  There is
     patchy infiltrate and effusion at the left lung base.  A subsequent chest CT
     also demonstrated effusion on the right side, which is not as apparent from
     this film.
     
     A supine film of the abdomen shows metallic clips associated with right upper
     quadrant attributable to cholecystectomy.  There are multiple additional
     metallic clips in the abdomen associated with a history of prior renal surgery
     and ileal conduit formation.  Prosthesis associated with both hips.  There is
     no evidence of abnormal metallic density overlying the spinal canal.  There
     are compression fractures of the lumbar spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of metallic foreign body to preclude MRI.  Left lower
     lobe pneumonia.  Hip prostheses.  Metallic densities attributable to abdominal
     surgery.

     INDICATION:  Brain mass.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted sequences were obtained through
     the brain followed with multiplanar post-gadolinium T1 imaging.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no slow diffusion to indicate an acute infarct.  There is
     a 1.3 x 1.8 cm intensely enhancing intra-axial mass in the white matter of the
     left frontal lobe.  There is a large amount of adjacent vasogenic edema. There
     is mild associated mass effect with 5 mm of subfalcine herniation. There is no
     uncal herniation.  No additional enhancing foci are identified. There are no
     areas of abnormal magnetic susceptibility.  This study is somewhat limited due
     to patient motion artifact.  There are several scattered foci of increased T2
     signal on the FLAIR sequence within the periventricular and subcortical white
     matter of both cerebral hemispheres, most consistent with chronic
     microvascular ischemic change.  These findings are also noted within the pons.
     No associated enhancing abnormalities are noted within these areas.
     
     The previously mentioned densely enhancing left frontal lobe mass has a tiny
     focus of magnetic susceptibility within it which could indicate a small focus
     of intratumoral hemorrhage or calcium.
     
     The differential diagnosis of this mass includes a primary brain neoplasm or
     a metastasis.  However, cerebral metastases from cervical cancer are
     considered rare.  The degree of vasogenic edema, however, would favor a
     metastatic process.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Medium-sized densely enhancing intra-axial mass in the white
     matter of the left frontal lobe.  A large amount of associated vasogenic edema
     is present.  Differential diagnosis includes primary brain neoplasm or a
     metastatic lesion, although cerebral metastases from cervical cancer are
     considered unusual.  The large amount of vasogenic edema would favor a
     metastatic diagnosis, although this is not considered a specific finding.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Brain mass.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted sequences were obtained through
     the brain followed with multiplanar post-gadolinium T1 imaging.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no slow diffusion to indicate an acute infarct.  There is
     a 1.3 x 1.8 cm intensely enhancing intra-axial mass in the white matter of the
     left frontal lobe.  There is a large amount of adjacent vasogenic edema. There
     is mild associated mass effect with 5 mm of subfalcine herniation. There is no
     uncal herniation.  No additional enhancing foci are identified. There are no
     areas of abnormal magnetic susceptibility.  This study is somewhat limited due
     to patient motion artifact.  There are several scattered foci of increased T2
     signal on the FLAIR sequence within the periventricular and subcortical white
     matter of both cerebral hemispheres, most consistent with chronic
     microvascular ischemic change.  These findings are also noted within the pons.
     No associated enhancing abnormalities are noted within these areas.
     
     The previously mentioned densely enhancing left frontal lobe mass has a tiny
     focus of magnetic susceptibility within it which could indicate a small focus
     of intratumoral hemorrhage or calcium.
     
     The differential diagnosis of this mass includes a primary brain neoplasm or
     a metastasis.  However, cerebral metastases from cervical cancer are
     considered rare.  The degree of vasogenic edema, however, would favor a
     metastatic process.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Medium-sized densely enhancing intra-axial mass in the white
     matter of the left frontal lobe.  A large amount of associated vasogenic edema
     is present.  Differential diagnosis includes primary brain neoplasm or a
     metastatic lesion, although cerebral metastases from cervical cancer are
     considered unusual.  The large amount of vasogenic edema would favor a
     metastatic diagnosis, although this is not considered a specific finding.

     INDICATION:  72-year-old woman with new brain mass, assess for possible
     primary.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired axial images from the thoracic inlet to the pubic
     symphysis were acquired without the use of intravenous contrast material due
     to the patient's renal failure.  Images were displayed with 5 mm slice
     thickness and multiplanar reformatted images were performed.
     
     No prior studies are available for comparison purposes.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST.  Assessment for primary malignancy is
     limited due to the absence of contrast.  There are bilateral moderately-sized
     pleural effusions loculated on the right.  Several areas of nodular thickening
     with somewhat spiculated appearance are seen in the right upper lobe (2:25 and
     2:30).  Small ground-glass opacities adjacent to the major fissure is seen
     (2:27).  There is compressive atelectasis at both lung bases.  No pneumonia is
     apparent.  There is a trace pericardial effusion.  The heart is normal in
     size.  There are atherosclerotic calcifications of the coronary arteries.  No
     mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy is apparent although difficult to assess
     without contrast.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Liver and spleen and pancreas
     appear unremarkable.  The gallbladder is distended without CT evidence of
     stones or wall thickening.  The patient is status post right-sided
     nephrectomy.  There is hydronephrosis on the left likely related to the
     patient's ileal conduit status post bladder resection.  The acuity of this
     cannot be assessed.  Thorough examination with ultrasound may be indicated. 
     No apparent abnormality within stomach, large or small bowel is seen.  There
     are no apparent masses or lymphadenopathy.  There is no ascites.

     @@@@@@@@@@@@@@ This is a revision of a previously signed report @@@@@@@@@@@@@@

     -INDICATION:  72-year-old female status post left frontal mass biopsy.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3149-1-24**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS: The study is somewhat degraded by patient motion.  The patient is
     status post biopsy of a left frontal lobe lesion via a left frontal burr hole
     approach. Hyperdensity within the lesion itself is consistent with blood, with
     gas within the central of the lesion. This and mainly  left frontal
     pneumocephalus are consistent with recent biopsy. A large amount of stable
     vasogenic edema in the left frontal region is unchanged.  Left to right shift
     of normally midline structures is not increased.  There is no extra- axial
     hemorrhage, or new mass effect.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Left mainly frontal pneumocephalus and blood and gas within the
     patient's known left frontal mass as expected status post biopsy.  No interval
     increase in mass effect or rightward subfalcine herniation.
     
     NOTE: A small amount of left sided frontal scalp soft tissue swelling is
     noted, presumably postoperative in nature, and which lies slightly caudal to
     the left frontal burr hole.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA:
        22.0 mCi F-18 FDG ([**3149-2-3**]);
     INDICATION: 72 Y/O WOMAN W/ H/O CERVICAL CA AND RECENT DIAG OF L.FRONTO  
     -PARIETAL MASS FOUND TO BE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA  
       
     METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18 
     fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation
     correction and for fusion with emission PET images. [The noncontrast CT images
     are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of
     overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose
     level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 132mg/dl. The area
     imaged spanned the region from the skull to the upper thighs.  
        
     Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET
     images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The
     determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important
     implications regarding the significance of that uptake.   
       
     INTERPRETATION:  
       
     There is a 1.5 cm mass in the left frontal lobe with increased FDG avidity (SUV
     4.5), surrounded by extensive vasogenic edema.  
       
     There is a focal 1.3 cm faint opacity in the right middle lobe without abnormal
     uptake of FDG. There is mild emphysema.   
     The patient is post right nephrectomy, cystectomy and ileal conduit. There is
     left hydronephrosis. The bowel is dilated with fluid, overall unchanged since
     the prior CT torso study. There is no FDG avid node in the abdomen or pelvis.  
       
     There is diffuse osteoporosis with multiple compression fractures and
     degenerative changes as seen on the prior CT.  
        
     Physiologic uptake is seen in the myocardium and GI tract and [**Hospital Unit Name **] tract.  
        
     IMPRESSION:  1.1.5 cm mass in the left frontal lobe with increased FDG avidity
     (SUV 4.5), surrounded by extensive vasogenic edema.  2.Post right nephrectomy,
     cystectomy and ileal conduit, and left hydronephrosis. 3.Diffuse osteoporosis
     with multiple compression fractures and degenerative  changes as seen on the
     prior CT.  4.1.3 cm faint focal opacity in the right middle lobe without
     abnormal FDG uptake, overall unchanged since [**3149-1-21**]. Despite the negative FDG
     avidity, the possibility of neoplasm such as BAC cannot be excluded. Clinical
     correlation and close follow up by dedicated chest CT is recommended.

     INDICATION:  72-year-old female with brain cancer, needs chemotherapy.
     
     RADIOLOGIST:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2339**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2340**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2339**],
     the attending radiologist, was present and supervising throughout.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A preprocedure timeout was performed to confirm the
     patient's identity and type of procedure to be performed.  The left upper
     extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Ultrasound was
     used to identify the left brachial vein, which was patent and compressible.
     After injection of 5 cc of 1% lidocaine, a 21-gauge needle was advanced under
     ultrasonic guidance into the left brachial vein.  Hard copy ultrasound images
     were obtained before and after venous access documenting patency.  A 0.018
     guide wire was then advanced through the needle to the distal SVC.  The needle
     was then exchanged for a 4.5 French micropuncture sheath.  A 4-French single
     lumen PICC catheter was then advanced through the sheath under fluoroscopic
     guidance into the distal SVC.  The peel-away sheath and wire were then
     removed.  A final fluoroscopic image of the chest demonstrates the tip of the
     catheter to be located in the distal SVC.  The patient tolerated the procedure
     well, and there were no immediate post-procedure complications.  The catheter
     was flushed and StatLocked in appropriate position.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of 4 French single lumen PICC catheter
     measuring 42 cm.  The tip is in the distal SVC.  The catheter is ready for
     use.

     INDICATION:  73-year-old woman with known CNS lymphoma, change in mental
     status in the last 24 hours, now minimally responsive.  New lateral gaze
     deviation.  Assess for midline shift and edema.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT head without contrast.
     
     COMPARISONS:  MR head dated [**3149-3-3**] and CT head of [**3149-1-25**].
     
     FINDINGS:  In comparison to the prior studies of March and [**3149-1-3**], there
     is increased amount of edema in the left frontal lobe with new areas of
     hypodensities in the right frontal subcortical white matter.  There is
     progressive subfalcine herniation to the right with a midline shift of maximum
     of 6 mm (previously 4 mm, [**3149-3-3**]).  The ventricular system remains
     stable in size without evidence of hydrocephalus.  The basilar cisterns are
     patent.  There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.  Visualized
     portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  There is a
     biopsy defect in the left frontal skull.  Surrounding soft tissue structures
     appear unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Increase in vasogenic edema in left but increasingly also involving the
     right frontal lobe.
     
     2.  Increased subfalcine herniation with midline shift to the right.

     INDICATION:  73-year-old woman with CNS lymphoma and acute mental status
     change.
     
     COMPARISON:  Non-contrast head CT from one day prior as well as MR of the
     brain from [**3149-3-3**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal and axial T1, axial T2, FLAIR, gradient-echo, and
     diffusion-weighted images were obtained pre-contrast and coronal T1 post-
     contrast images were obtained.
     
     MRI OF THE BRAIN:  There has been marked progression in the FLAIR and T2
     signal abnormality involving white matter in predominantly both frontal lobes,
     left worse than right.  The number of enhancing lesions has also increased
     dramatically, and involve areas of both frontal regions, the right parietal
     region, the left corpus callosum, the left basal ganglia, and the left greater
     than right cerebral peduncles.  In the left and right frontal regions, there
     is possible leptomeningeal involvement as well.  Several of the enhancing
     lesions now are peripherally enhancing with central lower signal, suggestive
     of central necrosis.  
     
     As on the recent CT, there is mild subfalcine herniation, roughly 4 mm.
     
     In the left frontal region, there is a small region of gradient-echo
     abnormality suggesting blood or mineralization.  The paranasal sinuses appear
     clear.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Increase in the number and extent of enhancing lesions involving
     multiple areas of the brain as described above as well as an increase in the
     surrounding white matter edema.

     HISTORY:  Lymphoma.
     
     Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates a nasogastric tube in the
     stomach.  The tip of the tube projects off the inferior aspect of the imaged
     field of view.  A left-sided PICC line is unchanged.  Surgical staples project
     over the epigastrium.  Remote left humeral surgical neck fracture is again
     seen.  Moderate-to-severe degenerative change of the right glenohumeral joint
     is again noted.  No consolidation.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Support lines in place.  No acute cardiopulmonary disease.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  73-year-old female with probable large B-cell dominant CNS lymphoma
     status post chemotherapy with worsening mental status.
     
     Comparison is made to prior MRI examinations dated [**3149-1-20**] and [**5-31**], 2007.
     
     HEAD MRI:
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1, T2, diffusion-weighted, and post-gadolinium
     sequences were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     Since most recent examination, there are now multiple small foci of
     precontrast increased T1 intensity lesions along the subcortical and deep
     white matter, predominantly within the prefrontal region bilaterally adjacent
     to the primary motor cortex and within the anterior superior right frontal
     lobe. These areas display evidence of restricted diffusion, with some
     displaying low signal on the ADC map.  Minimal FLAIR abnormality is noted
     within these lesions.  Post- contrast images display diffuse enhancing lesions
     most prominent within the superior frontal lobes bilaterally with probable
     leptomeningeal involvement. When compared to most recent examination, the
     size, ring enhancement, and total number of enhancing lesions is decreased.  A
     minimal amount of rightward subfalcine herniation persists; otherwise, there
     is no other evidence of significant mass effect or hydrocephalus.  Small
     punctate region of susceptibility artifact within the right frontal lobe,
     likely from prior biopsy is stable, with no new areas of susceptibility
     artifact are identified. Diffuse vasogenic edema within the cerebral peduncles
     and frontal lobes persists and does not appear significantly changed.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Decreased total number enhancing lesions within the brain parenchyma
     suggestive of chemotherapy steroid response.  Unchanged vasgogenic edema
     
     2.  New hyperintense T1 lesions displaying restricted diffusion predominantly
     within the prefrontal subcortical white matter. Differential diagnosis
     includes new small hemorrhagic metastatic lesions or hemorrhagic small vessel
     infarcts from an etiology such as vasculitis.  No new susceptability artifact
                                                                 (Over)
