     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      e/f pneumonia vx evidence of CHF

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: Fever shortness of breath.
     
     Two views of the chest are compared to prior study from yesterday. There are
     overlying sternal wires. There is borderline enlargement of the cardial
     contours. There is tortuosity and calcification of the aorta. There is
     decreasing opacity involving the right upper as well as the right lower lobe.
     There is persistent retrocardiac density. There is no pneumothorax or pleural
     effusion. The osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION: Slight change but persistent opacity involving the right lower
     lobe, right upper lobe as well as the retrocardiac region.  This may represent
     decreasing pulmonary congestion, that has improved. Although, infection is
     still possible.
