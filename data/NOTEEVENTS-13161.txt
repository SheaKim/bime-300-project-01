      Large right frontal/temporal mass with edema and subfalcine shift.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Confusion for four days with normal neurologic exam.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     CT OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is a 3.4 x 3.6 cm mass
     within the region of the right anterior cranial fossa, extending into the
     right middle cranial fossa with probable displacement of the anterior portion
     of the right temporal lobe.  There is extensive hypodensity within the
     subcortical white matter consistent with adjacent vasogenic edema. There is
     marked right to left subfalcine shift and compression of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 548**] and
     body of the right lateral ventricle.  There is additional right-sided
     displacement of the pons and probable right uncal herniation.  The left
     lateral ventricle is dilated. Elsewhere within the brain, there is no loss of
     [**Doctor Last Name 8**]-white differentiation to suggest an acute minor or major vascular
     territorial infarct.  There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Bone windows demonstrate no evidence of fracture.  There is no
     definite evidence of osseous destruction by the large right-sided mass.  The
     mastoid air cells and visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses are
     normally pneumatized.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  3.4 x 3.6 cm mass involving the right anterior cranial fossa and the
     anterior portion of the right temporal lobe, extending inferiorly to the right
     middle cranial fossa with mass effect and adjacent vasogenic edema.  This may
     be further evaluated with MR of the brain with gadolinium. The appearance is
     strongly suggestive of meningioma.
     2.  Dilation of the left lateral ventricle and probable right uncal herniation
     due to mass effect and edema.
     3.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
     
     Results were discussed with the ED resident caring for the patient at the time
     of interpretation (6:50 p.m.).

     respiratory infection.
     
     CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:  The heart size is normal.  The aorta is calcified and
     slightly tortuous.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.
     Pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable.  The lungs are clear without evidence
     of infiltrate.  The lungs are slightly hyperexpanded suggestive of
     emphysematous changes.  There are no definite pleural effusions.  Mild
     degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted. Surrounding osseous and
     soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Emphysematous changes.  No evidence of pneumonia.

     HISTORY:  Prior CT scan detected a mass lesion.  Four days of confusion.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted gadolinium-enhanced brain imaging.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is confirmation of the presence of an approxiamtely 3.5cm
     densely and relatively homogeneously enhancing mass which is seen attached to
     the right pterion, and likely the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid
     bone. There is thickening of the adjacent dura, likely representing a so-
     called ""dural tail.""  More generalized thickening of the dura is noted along
     both occipital convexity surfaces.  However, this is likely a reactive change
     as it is not in proximity to the mass.  The lesion also likely overlies the
     right superior orbital fissure and extends within a few millimeters to the
     lateral aspect of the junction of the cavernous and supraclinoid portions of
     the right internal carotid artery.  The dural tail joins the lateral aspect of
     this portion of the internal carotid artery.  There is no gross evidence for
     vascular encasement of these vessels.  However, the posterior aspect of the
     mass approximates the mid portion of the M1 segment and anterior trifurcation
     branch of the right middle cerebral artery.  Therefore, extreme care would

     need to be exercised if there is a proposed surgical resection of this mass in
     order to avoid vascular damage.  The lesion is T2 hypointense and has an
     internal radiating pattern of vessels.  All these features are quite typical
     for meningioma.
     
     There is extensive edema surrounding the mass with marked compression of the
     right lateral ventricle, particularly the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 548**] with nearly 1 cm of
     leftward subfalcine herniation.  There are no other definite abnormalities
     seen intracranially.  There is a probable tiny mucous retention cyst along the
     floor of the right maxillary sinus.  There is minimal mucosal thickening
     within the right mastoid sinus.

without
any changes noted over the last weeks/months. The daughter has
not noticed any changes in walking or and did not see 
clumsiness.

The patient is able to tell that she has had difficulties
concentrating and cannot think clearly. She is not alarmed by
this at all and would like to go home. She denies any headache,
nausea, vomiting, weakness, clumsiness, problems speaking,
dizziness, double vision or blurry vision, numbness or tingling.
During the interview she has a hard time remembering recent
events, and is thinking slowly.

Brief Hospital Course:
 The patient is a 78-year-old female who was recently admitted 
to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] from the ER with several days of 
confusion noted by a daughter. She presented with progressive 
confusion and left-sided hemiparesis. The patient was worked-up 
in the ER and was found to have a left-sided intracranial lesion 
consistent with a skull base meningioma. Patient electively 
taken to the OR after informed consent.  Postoperatively she 
found to be awake, alert following commands and moving all 
extremeties. She had received some blood products and became 
fluid overloaded and was moved to the MICU.  

On Postop day 3 postoperative MRI was performed and showed 
persistent edema. Full resection with no intracranial 
complications. There was small subgaleal
hematoma at that time. The patient was clinically doing well and 
was in the MICU. The patient developed overnight suddenly a 
change in mentation and was barely arousable with slightly 
dilated pupil on the right side, and progressive
weakness on the left side. Repeat CT scan was performed that 
showed persistent right sided edema with temporal lobe 
compression, midline cyst, right sided subgaleal as well as 
epidural hematoma, as well as some intraparenchymal blood. There 
is an evolving right sided PCA and MCA stroke. The patient has 
incipient herniation and was taken emergently to the operating 
room for decompression.

A post op CT showed There are new foci of parenchymal hemorrhage 
in the 
right frontal lobe and right temporal lobe. There is continued 
edema, marked 
leftward subfalcine herniation, and an evolving right posterior 
cerebral artery distribution infarct. The overall degree of mass 
effect is unchanged. 
The extraaxial hemorrhage along the resection margin had been 
evacuated.

Her exam postoperatively showed a slightly dilated right pupil 
and withdrawal to pain in all extremeties but nothing to 
command.  A follow up head CT the next day showed a 
reaccumulation of blood in the right sided subgaleal and 
epidural hematoma.  After discussion with the family they 
decided to make the patient comfort measures only.  She passed 
away a few hours later.

     CT CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM:
     
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  4-day history of confusion. Large meningioma with edema
     and midline shift. Preoperative work up for meningioma.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Thin-section MDCT of the head during arterial phase of contrast
     enhancement, with multiplanar, MIP, and 3D reformats.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a 43 x 38 mm intensely enhancing lobulated mass centering
     on the right lesser [**Doctor First Name 557**] of sphenoid, involving both the anterior and middle
     cranial fossae. It appears to be dural based, and extra-axial in location,
     producing much vasogenic edema at the adjacent cerebrum, consistent with a
     large meningioma. There is associated subfalcine herniation, causing a midline
     shift of about 5 mm, leading to dilatation of the contralateral lateral
     ventricle, and the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 548**] of the ipsilateral lateral ventricle,
     indicating obstructive hydrocephalus.  The extent is unchanged from the prior
     scans of 10/1705.
     
     The circle of [**Location (un) 72**] and its principal branches are patent, demonstrating
     normal tapering. No vascular occlusion, aneurysm greater than 3 mm, or
     vascular malformation is identified within the scan volume. There are multiple
     tiny, serpiginous vascular structures adjacent to the  right-sided meningioma,
     directing towards the cortical veins, likely to indicate prominent drainage
     veins, or collateral vessels.
     
     CONCLUSION:  43 x 38 mm meningioma, centering on the right lesser [**Doctor First Name 557**] of
     sphenoid, involving both the anterior and middle cranial fossae. Subfalcine
     herniation by 5 mm persists, with associated obstructive hydrocephalus,
     especially of the contralateral lateral ventricle. Prominent serpiginous
     vessels around the meningioma - ?  drainage veins, ? collaterals.

     Diagnostic cerebral angiogram for evaluation of feeding vessels.
     
     PHYSICIANS: The procedure was performed by Drs [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13405**], [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 914**] [**Doctor Last Name 915**], and
     [**Doctor First Name **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the attneding radiologist, being present and
     supervising during the procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Informed consent was obtained from the patient and the patient???s
     family after explaining the risks, indications and alternative management.
     Risks explained included stroke, loss of vision and speech, temporary or
     permanent, with possible treatment with stent and coils if needed. 
     
     The patient was brought to the Interventional Neuroradiology Theater and
     placed on the biplane table in supine position. Both groins were prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion. Access to the right common femoral artery
     was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall needle, under local anesthesia using
     1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate and with aseptic precautions.
     Through the needle, a 0.35 [**Last Name (un) 193**] wire was introduced and the needle taken
     out. Over the wire, a 5 Fr vascular sheath was placed and connected to a
     saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units in 500 cc of saline) with a
     continuous drip. Through the sheath, a 4 Fr Berenstein catheter was introduced
     and connected to continuous saline infusion (with mixture of 1000 units of
     heparin in 1000 cc of saline). 
     
     Berenstein 2 catheter was also used for attempts of selectively catheterizing
     the right vertebral artery, and the left common carotid artery.
     
     The following blood vessels were selectively catheterized and angiograms were
     obtained in AP and lateral projections.  Right internal carotid artery, right
     external carotid artery, left common carotid artery, and left subclavian
     artery.
                                                                 (Over)

     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  78-year-old woman with sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 557**] meningioma.
     Diagnostic cerebral angiogram for evaluation of feeding vessels.
     
     PHYSICIANS: The procedure was performed by Drs [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13405**], [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 914**] [**Doctor Last Name 915**], and
     [**Doctor First Name **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the attneding radiologist, being present and
     supervising during the procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Informed consent was obtained from the patient and the patient???s
     family after explaining the risks, indications and alternative management.
     Risks explained included stroke, loss of vision and speech, temporary or
     permanent, with possible treatment with stent and coils if needed. 
     
     The patient was brought to the Interventional Neuroradiology Theater and
     placed on the biplane table in supine position. Both groins were prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion. Access to the right common femoral artery
     was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall needle, under local anesthesia using
     1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate and with aseptic precautions.
     Through the needle, a 0.35 [**Last Name (un) 193**] wire was introduced and the needle taken
     out. Over the wire, a 5 Fr vascular sheath was placed and connected to a
     saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units in 500 cc of saline) with a
     continuous drip. Through the sheath, a 4 Fr Berenstein catheter was introduced
     and connected to continuous saline infusion (with mixture of 1000 units of
     heparin in 1000 cc of saline). 
     
     Berenstein 2 catheter was also used for attempts of selectively catheterizing
     the right vertebral artery, and the left common carotid artery.
     
     The following blood vessels were selectively catheterized and angiograms were
     obtained in AP and lateral projections.  Right internal carotid artery, right
     external carotid artery, left common carotid artery, and left subclavian
     artery.
                                                                 (Over)

     CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM.
     
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  78-year-old woman with sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 557**] meningioma.
     Diagnostic cerebral angiogram for evaluation of feeding vessels.
     
     PHYSICIANS: The procedure was performed by Drs [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13405**], [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 914**] [**Doctor Last Name 915**], and
     [**Doctor First Name **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the attneding radiologist, being present and
     supervising during the procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Informed consent was obtained from the patient and the patient???s
     family after explaining the risks, indications and alternative management.
     Risks explained included stroke, loss of vision and speech, temporary or
     permanent, with possible treatment with stent and coils if needed. 
     
     The patient was brought to the Interventional Neuroradiology Theater and
     placed on the biplane table in supine position. Both groins were prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion. Access to the right common femoral artery
     was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall needle, under local anesthesia using
     1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate and with aseptic precautions.
     Through the needle, a 0.35 [**Last Name (un) 193**] wire was introduced and the needle taken
     out. Over the wire, a 5 Fr vascular sheath was placed and connected to a
     saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units in 500 cc of saline) with a
     continuous drip. Through the sheath, a 4 Fr Berenstein catheter was introduced
     and connected to continuous saline infusion (with mixture of 1000 units of
     heparin in 1000 cc of saline). 
     
     Berenstein 2 catheter was also used for attempts of selectively catheterizing
     the right vertebral artery, and the left common carotid artery.
     
     The following blood vessels were selectively catheterized and angiograms were
     obtained in AP and lateral projections.  Right internal carotid artery, right
     external carotid artery, left common carotid artery, and left subclavian
     artery.
                                                                 (Over)

     FINDINGS:  Injection of the right external carotid artery demonstrates a
     large, lobulated intensely enhancing mass on the lesser [**Doctor First Name 557**] of sphenoid more
     consistent with the known history of meningioma.  It derives its blood
     supplied mainly from branches arising from the internal maxillary artery.
     Injection of the right internal carotid artery demonstrate patchy peripheral
     enhancement of the meningioma.
     
     Injection of the left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery images
     obtained of the ipsilateral vertebral artery demonstrate no cross-over supply
     of the meningioma.
     
     On the AP projections, there is displacement of the right anterior cerebral
     artery to the left, demonstrated previously on the CT.  These findings suggest
     a degree of subfalcine herniation.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Large right-sided meningioma centering on the lesser [**Doctor First Name 557**] of
     sphenoid, involving both the middle and anterior cranial fossae, blood supply
     mainly deriving from the branches of the internal maxillary artery, patchy
     peripheral foci ____ the tumor is also demonstrated on the ipsilateral
     internal carotid injection.  Subfalcine herniation is present, as indicated by
     shifting of the left anterior cerebral artery to the left.

     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient status post craniotomy for further evaluation.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion
     axial images of the brain were obtained before gadolinium.  T1 axial, sagittal
     and coronal images obtained following gadolinium.  Comparison was made with
     the previous study of [**2586-10-18**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Since the previous MRI study, a large extra-axial mass in the right
     frontotemporal region has been resected.  Blood products are seen in the
     surgical bed with surrounding edema as before with mass effect on the right
     lateral ventricle and mild midline shift.  There is no evidence of acute
     infarct seen.  Slow diffusion visualized in the region of surgery secondary to
     blood clotinthesurgical bed.  Air is seen within the intracranial compartment
     as well as at the surgical site in the skull region.  No other abnormal areas

     INDICATIONS:  Status post epidural evacuation.  Assess for new hemorrhage.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT.
     
     COMPARISON:  Head CT from [**2586-10-23**], five hours earlier.
     
     NONCONTRAST HEAD CT:  There are new foci of parenchymal hemorrhage in the
     right frontal lobe and right temporal lobe.  There is continued edema, marked
     leftward subfalcine herniation, and an evolving right posterior cerebral
     artery distribution infarct.  The overall degree of mass effect is unchanged.
     There is stable marked enlargement of the left lateral ventricle, raising
     suspicion for ventricular entrapment at the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 4532**].
     
     The extraaxial hemorrhage along the resection margin has been evacuated is now
     filled with air.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1  Evacuation of extraaxial hemorrhage at surgical margin.
     
     2.  New foci of parenchymal hemorrhage in the right frontal and right temporal
     lobes.
     
     3.  Continued mass effect, marked leftward subfalcine herniation, and
     enlargement of the left lateral ventricle, raising suspicion for entrapment.
     
     Results were discussed with [**Doctor First Name 231**] at 11:30 a.m. on [**2586-10-23**].

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Status post meningioma resection with altered mental status.
     
     COMPARISON:  MRI from [**2586-10-21**]; and head CT from [**2586-10-19**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There has been marked interval increase in size
     of the heterogeneous fluid collection within the right extra-axial space
     containing air as well as new hyperdense material, consistent with acute
     hemorrhage, likely epidural in origin. There is marked increase in the amount
     of adjacent mass effect upon the entire right cerebral hemisphere with marked
     right-to- left subfalcine herniation and effacement of the sulci. There is
     loss of [**Doctor Last Name 8**] and white differentiation within the right cerebral hemisphere,
     most significantly within the right occipital region, which appears new in the
     interval. Additionally, there has been interval increase in the size of right
     frontotemporal subgaleal hematoma.
     
     Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  Right
     frontotemporal craniotomy defect is again noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Interval increase in size of the right extra-axial heterogeneous fluid
     collection with pneumocephalus and a new hyperdense component noted,
     suggestive of an acute hemorrhage, likely epidural in nature.  There is
     profound interval increase in the degree of right-to-left subfalcine
     herniation and probable uncal herniation.  Significant mass effect and edema
     is present involving the entire right cerebral hemisphere.
     2.  Interval development of loss of [**Doctor Last Name 8**] and white differentiation within the
     right occipital lobe suggestive of evolving infarction.
     3.  Interval increase in amount of hematoma within the right frontotemporal
     subgaleal region.
     
     Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 13416**] was immediately informed of these findings at 4:30 p.m. on [**10-23**], 2005.
     
     NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW:  I agree with the findings of acute extra-
     axial hemorrhage, likely epidural, severe increase in mass effect with right
     to left shift and posterior cerebral artery infarction. I do not believe that
     the swelling invovlves the entire right hemisphere. There is low density in
     the frontal lobe, likely due to the tumor and surgical changes, rather than
     infarction. This region is unchanged. Similarly, the right middle cerebral
                                                                 (Over)

CV: HR 60-80's, NSR with no ectopy. ABP via right radial art line initially 140's...5mg IV lopressor given without effect. BP briefly elevated to 160 and 10mg IV hydralazine given with quick response; BP then 120's. Lytes repleted during prior shift and rechecked around MN...no need for further replacement. Pt hypotensive (most likely d/t increased UO) and given LR fluid bolus x2.  

Access: PIV x2. 

Resp: Pt received on 40%face tent, but prior ABG showed PaO2 76. FiO2 increased to 50% with corresponding ABG 7.40/33/92/21. RR 20's easy/regular, no cough but +gag. Mucous membranes dry with minimal secretions. BBS clear-coarse (mostly noise heard from upper airway). 

Neuro: Pt not receiving sedatives since morning of 10/30 Initial assessment, pupils equal/reactive. Pt not opening eyes, but withdraws BUE/BLE to nailbed pressure. Small amount of bleeding noted from surgical incision site. At midnight, noted that patient had UO>400cc urine output in absence of diuretics. At 0100 patient again had large volume UO, BP decreased into 90's. Pupils rechecked with right 5mm/left 3mm...pupils very sluggish. RUE less responsive to nailbed pressure. T-SICU resident paged and notified of hypotension/UO and change in neuro status. To unit to evaluate patient around 0140. Urine lytes sent; pt hypotensive (SBP 80's) and given 500cc LR bolus with slight response. Okay per T-SICU team for SBP 90's. T-SICU resident to discuss changes with neuro-[**Doctor First Name **] and called unit to notify RN that neuro-[**Doctor First Name **] would be by to see patient. Around 0240, T-SICU resident, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2451**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], again paged to be notified that neuro-[**Doctor First Name **] had not been by. Neuro assessment had continued to decline...right pupil non-reactive and patient no longer withdrawing to nailbed pressure on right side; posturing on left side with sternal rub and abnormal flexion noted with nailbed pressure. Still withdrawing lower extremities to nailbed pressure. Neuro-[**Doctor First Name **] then directly paged and to bedside around 0300. Stat CT head ordered. Upon return from CT scan pt hypothermic, 93.3 ax; bair hugger applied. Hypotensive as well and another 500cc bolus LR ordered.  CT read by neuro-[**Doctor First Name **] resident and stat lasix and decadron given. Pharmacy paged for stat mannitol. LR bolus stopped and Neo hung to maintain BP. After neuro-[**Doctor First Name **] resident spoke with attending, decision made to take patient emergently to OR. Resident spoke with daughter and consent given for OR procedure. Anesthesia to unit, mannitol still not available from pharmacy and anesthesia aware...pt taken to OR around 0530. Pt on schedule doses of dilantin and decadron. 

GI/GU: Abdomen softly distended, BS present. Pt unresponsive except to painful stimulus, so OG tube placed at 2200 with CXR for confirmation. Promote with fiber TF's restarted. No BM xfew days. UO clear/yellow and >400cc/hr around MN as described above.

ID: Pt has been running low-grade temps with last temp spike last evening. Pan cx am [**10-22**]. Vanco/levofloxacin. 

Social: Daughter primary contact.
