Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46 year old
female with a history of polysubstance abuse who was
transferred from [**Hospital 9701**] Hospital on [**3-3**] with
hypoxemic respiratory failure.  The patient has a complicated
recent medical history including an admission to [**Hospital 9701**]
Hospital in [**3129-11-22**] following an overdose with
multiple substances, subsequently developing bilateral
question aspiration pneumonias requiring an Intensive Care
Unit stay (it is not clear if the patient was intubated at
this time).  The patient developed persistent hypoxemia after
her November admission and was placed on 3 liters of nasal
cannula oxygen upon discharge in December.  In the interim
she had restarted using alcohol, intravenous heroin,
intranasal cocaine and abusing other pills including PCAs.
In this setting she presented to [**Hospital 9701**] Hospital on [**2-13**] with complaints of increasing shortness of breath.  She
had increased her use of intravenous heroin and intranasal
cocaine within the preceding week.  She was begun on
Ceftazidime and Clindamycin for possible aspiration pneumonia
and also given steroids and nebulizers for compliance of
reactive disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Her initial chest x-rays at the outside hospital revealed
diffuse bilateral infiltrates concerning for adult
respiratory distress syndrome versus bilateral pneumonias due
to severe aspiration.  The patient had increasing oxygen
requirement and was eventually placed on nonrebreather on the
medical floor.  By report, her echocardiogram revealed normal
left ventricular function.  Antibiotics were changed to
Levaquin on [**2-17**] and then to Azithromycin on [**2-20**].  The patient's respiratory status continued to decline
and she was intubated on [**3130-2-22**] at [**Hospital 9701**]
Hospital.  The patient underwent bronchial alveolar lavage on
[**2-24**].  She had a negative lenie on [**2-16**].

The patient continued to require increasing positive end
expiratory pressure and ventilatory supports by aggressive
antibiotic therapy and Intensive Care Unit management.  The
patient underwent a chest computerized tomography scan on
[**2-25**] which revealed diffuse bilateral interstitial lung
disease with subpleural bronchiectasis with a diffuse
reticular nodular pattern.  The patient underwent right open
wound biopsy on [**3130-2-27**] after which a right tube was
placed.  The patient continued to require high forced
inspiratory oxygen levels and positive end-expiratory
pressure.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 291**] for further evaluation
management of her bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, question
acute and chronic pulmonary disease of unclear etiology.  She
was transferred on [**3130-3-3**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Polysubstance abuse; 2.  Question
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; 3.  Question untreated
obstructive [**Doctor Last Name 292**] apnea; 4.  Obesity; 5.  Question bipolar
disorder versus depression with psychotic features; 6.
Question reactive airway disease.

ALLERGIES:  Codeine causes gastrointestinal upset.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Propofol drip; Versed drip; Lovenox
subcutaneous; morphine drip; Ciprofloxacin 400 intravenously
b.i.d.; Lopressor; Lansoprazole; Solu-Medrol 60 b.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive tobacco use, patient lives with
sister and has had a long history of polysubstance abuse
including intravenous heroin, intranasal cocaine, alcohol and
psychiatric medications.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission temperature 99,
heartrate 66, blood pressure 107/70, respiratory rate 18,
oxygen saturation 96%.

LABORATORY DATA:  Arterial blood gases, 7.41, pACO2 46, pAO2
72, on FIO2 of 65% with positive end-expiratory pressure of
15.  White count 17.3, hematocrit 37, platelets 272.  Chem-7
sodium 139, potassium 4, chloride 97, bicarbonate 28, BUN 16,
creatinine 0.3, glucose 117, normal coagulation studies.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Fennard
Intensive Care Unit on [**3-3**] for further evaluation and
management of her diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrate and
persistent hypoxemia.  The patient's initial chest x-ray
revealed left lower lobe collapse and consolidation with
bibasilar ill-defined pulmonary infiltrate.  Given that the
patient had received greater than 14 days of broad-spectrum
antibiotics at the outside hospital the decision was made to
withhold any antibiotic treatment until sputum cultures were
revealing of an infectious etiology.  It is felt that the
patient was in the later stages of adult respiratory distress
syndrome.  Given that her open lung biopsy had revealed
diffuse alveolar damage, consistent with adult respiratory
distress syndrome and pulmonary edema, the patient was placed
on midury protocol for treatment of late stage adult
respiratory distress syndrome with tapering dose of
Solu-Medrol.  The patient continued, however, to have high
ventilatory support requirement with positive end-expiratory
pressure no less than 12.5 and FIO2 no less than 50%.  With
decreasing positive end-expiratory pressure and FIO2 the
patient immediately dropped oxygen saturation to the low 80s
with pAO2s in the 60s.  The patient continued to do well from
all other perspectives without complications of other organ
systems.  Her chest tube was removed on [**3130-3-5**]
without complications.  A PICC line was placed on [**3130-3-17**] for improved intravenous access, given poor
peripheral veins due to drug use.  Her right internal jugular
with triple lumen catheter was discontinued at this time.  A
repeat chest computerized tomography scan was obtained on
[**3130-3-18**] which revealed diffuse patchy areas of
groundglass opacification and consolidation.  There was
abnormal opacity of all areas of both lungs.  Consolidation
has a dependent distribution and no endobronchial lesions are
identified.  The computerized tomography scan was felt to be
consistent with diffuse alveolar damage/pulmonary edema in a
patient with adult respiratory distress syndrome.  The
possibility of acute interstitial pneumonitis, ([**Location (un) **] [**Doctor First Name **]
syndrome) was suggested.  Radiologically, infectious etiology
can not be excluded.

Multiple discussions were held in an attempt to further
elucidate the etiology of the patient's persistent hypoxemia.
It appears that this hospitalization was precipitated by an
acute injury in the setting of chronic interstitial lung
disease.  Whether the patient has interstitial pulmonary
fibrosis is not clear.  It is clear that the patient has a
long history of chemical dependence and overdoses with ?
development of chemical pneumonitis and repeat chemical
versus infectious lung injury.  The patient had tracheostomy
placed on [**3130-3-17**] as it became clear that she would
require continuous ventilatory support in the rehabilitation
setting.  Placement of tracheostomy was without
complications.  The patient continued to do well after
tracheostomy placement and eventually had a percutaneous
enterogastric jejunostomy tube placed on [**3130-2-16**] for
nutritional support.  The procedure was without complications
and tube feeds were started through her gastrostomy tube
without complications.  The patient was seen by physical
therapy and did well.

At the time of discharge, the patient has ventilatory
settings of pressure support 15 with positive end-expiratory
pressure of 12.5, FIO2 40 to 50%.  In this setting her minute
ventilation was 10-12 liters per minute with a title volume
of 4 to 600.  Of note, the patient desaturates rapidly with
excessive coughing and agitation.  She has required
persistently increasing amount of Klonopin and Risperdal for
agitation.  It is clear that her substance abuse issues need
to be addressed as an outpatient as well as her anxiety
issues.

Of note, the patient had increasing secretions on [**3-20**]
with mildly increased temperatures and mild leukocytosis to
15,000.  Given clinical scenario of increasing secretion and
history of greater than 20 days on the ventilator, the
patient was treated aggressively for ventilator associated
pneumonia and responded well with double coverage of gram
negative rods with Ceftazidime and Levofloxacin.  She is to
complete a 14 day course which showed finish on [**3130-4-3**].  The patient's secretions decreased significantly and
the patient has remained afebrile without leukocytosis since
initiation of these antibiotics.

The patient will need follow up with pulmonary doctor [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 958**], as her diagnosis and prognosis remains unclear.
She is improving with ventilatory support, however, her
ultimate oxygen requirements remain unclear at this time.  It
was recommended that she follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at
[**Hospital6 273**].  She will be discharged
to [**Hospital6 2766**] for ventilatory support and
pulmonary rehabilitation as well as physical therapy.  She is
felt to be an excellent rehabilitation candidate given her
lack of other medical issues.

     COMPARISON:  [**3130-3-4**].
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is a right IJ line whose tip is in the
     distal SVC.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Again seen is a right-sided chest
     tube in the right lower lung zone, not changed in position from the prior
     study.  There is a feeding tube whose tip extends below the level of the film.
     The endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position.  The heart size is enlarged
     with prominence of the pulmonary vasculature, however, the supine positioning
     limits evaluation for cardiac failure.  There are continued lower and mid zone
     patchy bilateral opacities, not significantly changed from the prior study.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Bibasilar pulmonary infiltrates not significantly changed from the prior
     study.

Respiratory Care
Remains on pressure control vent. Driving pressure increased to 30 due to worsening tidal volumes. Pt. was overbreathing by a few breaths and was out of sync with the vent. Even with sedation increased and no spontaneous breaths,she had what appeared to be discoordinate breathing and sats dropped, at one point as low as 70. Several attempted recruitment breaths done but poorly tolerated. She did respond to ambuing but would again decompensate when on the vent. With driving pressure up to 30, she is breathing in synch with the vent with much improved sats and abgs. Of note, pt. tolerated turning/washing this morning without incident on a lower level of sedation than earlier. Trans pulm pressure yesterday  measued at 15 ?re check today.

     PROCEDURE:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 3845**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 250**] were present with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 250**] supervising.
      Limited ultrasound revealed veins in the left arm.  The patient's left arm
     was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  No superficial vein was
     identified, so ultrasound was used to identify a patent and compressible left
     brachial vein.  1% Lidocaine was injected into the subdermal tissues for local
     analgesia.  Under real-time sonographic guidance, a 21-gauge needle was
     inserted into the left brachial vein and a 0.018 guide wire was inserted under
     fluoroscopic guidance into the axillary vein.  A 6 French Peel-Away sheath was
     introduced and the guide wire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the IVC.
     The distance from the skin puncture site to the SVC was measured at 40 cm.  A
     5 French double-lumen PICC was trimmed to the appropriate length and inserted
     under fluoroscopy into the SVC. Both lumens flushed and withdrew normally.
     Placement was confirmed with a spot radiograph.  The puncture site was cleaned

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Persistent hypoxemia in patient with ARDS.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging of the chest without contrast enhancement.
     
     CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is a 2.6 cm hypodense nodule in the right
     lobe of the thyroid gland.  There is no significant mediastinal or hilar lymph
     node enlargement.  The main pulmonary artery is normal in diameter.  The heart
     size is at the upper limit of normal.  There are no pleural effusions.
     
     Lung windows demonstrate diffuse, patchy areas of ground glass opacification
     and consolidation.  There is abnormal opacity in all areas of both lungs.  The
     consolidation has a dependent distribution.  No endobronchial lesions are
     identified.
     
     The skeletal structures are normal.  There is minimal fullness of the left
     adrenal gland; the imaged portion of the upper abdomen is otherwise
     unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Diffuse pulmonary parenchymal disease consistent with diffuse
     alveolar damage/pulmonary edema in a patient with ARDS.  These findings are
     consistent with acute interstitial pneumonia (Hamman-[**Doctor First Name **] syndrome).
     Radiologically, an infectious etiology remains in the differential diagnosis.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: 46 year old female with ARDS and on ventilation needs
     gastrojejunostomy feeding tube for long-term nutrition.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 615**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 262**] [**Doctor Last Name 263**]
     d'Othee with attending radiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 263**] [**Name (STitle) 264**] being present for the
     entire procedure.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 85**] reviewed the exam.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The risks and the benefits were explained to the
     patient's mother and consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine on
     the angiographic table and the abdomen was prepped and draped in sterile
     fashion. Air was injected into the stomach through a previously placed
     nasogastric tube (NGT). A puncture site of the stomach was localized under
     fluoroscopy in AP and lateral projections. Local anesthesia using 1% Lidocaine
     was supplied to the left upper quadrant of the puncture site. Three T-
     fasteners were placed through the 18 gauge needle into the stomach and secured
     outside of the skin. The stomach was punctured again using the 18 gauge needle
     and contrast was injected through the needle. Fluoroscopy showed good needle
     position with opacified gastric mucosa. An 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 528**] wire was placed
     through the needle into the stomach and the needle was exchanged for a 7 Fr
     BriteTip sheath. A 5 Fr MPA guiding catheter was placed over the wire and
     facilitated the wire advancement through the duodenum into the proximal
     jejunum. The [**Last Name (un) 528**] wire was exchanged for an 0.035 SuperStiff Amplatz wire
     over the guiding catheter and the catheter and the sheath were removed. The
     skin entry site was dilated using increasing-size dilators. A 14 Fr peel- away
     sheath was placed over the wire with the tip beyond the pylorus. A 14 Fr
     [**Doctor Last Name 939**] feeding tube was placed over the wire through the peel-away sheath with
     the tip in the proximal jejunum. The peel-away sheath was removed and the
     retention loop of the feeding tube was formed in the second portion of the
     duodenum. Injection of contrast through the feeding tube was done and an x-ray
     was taken, which showed jejunal mucosal pattern and correct tube positioning.
     The tube was secured to the skin using an O-Prolene stitch.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.
     
     MEDICATIONS: Totally 2 mg of Versed and 1 mcg of Fentanyl was given
     intravenously during the procedure in small divided doses under continuous
     hemodynamic monitoring. Approximately 25 ml contrast was used during the
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: 46 year old female with ARDS and on ventilation needs
     gastrojejunostomy feeding tube for long-term nutrition.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 615**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 262**] [**Doctor Last Name 263**]
     d'Othee with attending radiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 263**] [**Name (STitle) 264**] being present for the
     entire procedure.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 85**] reviewed the exam.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The risks and the benefits were explained to the
     patient's mother and consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine on
     the angiographic table and the abdomen was prepped and draped in sterile
     fashion. Air was injected into the stomach through a previously placed
     nasogastric tube (NGT). A puncture site of the stomach was localized under
     fluoroscopy in AP and lateral projections. Local anesthesia using 1% Lidocaine
     was supplied to the left upper quadrant of the puncture site. Three T-
     fasteners were placed through the 18 gauge needle into the stomach and secured
     outside of the skin. The stomach was punctured again using the 18 gauge needle
     and contrast was injected through the needle. Fluoroscopy showed good needle
     position with opacified gastric mucosa. An 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 528**] wire was placed
     through the needle into the stomach and the needle was exchanged for a 7 Fr
     BriteTip sheath. A 5 Fr MPA guiding catheter was placed over the wire and
     facilitated the wire advancement through the duodenum into the proximal
     jejunum. The [**Last Name (un) 528**] wire was exchanged for an 0.035 SuperStiff Amplatz wire
     over the guiding catheter and the catheter and the sheath were removed. The
     skin entry site was dilated using increasing-size dilators. A 14 Fr peel- away
     sheath was placed over the wire with the tip beyond the pylorus. A 14 Fr
     [**Doctor Last Name 939**] feeding tube was placed over the wire through the peel-away sheath with
     the tip in the proximal jejunum. The peel-away sheath was removed and the
     retention loop of the feeding tube was formed in the second portion of the
     duodenum. Injection of contrast through the feeding tube was done and an x-ray
     was taken, which showed jejunal mucosal pattern and correct tube positioning.
     The tube was secured to the skin using an O-Prolene stitch.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.
     
     MEDICATIONS: Totally 2 mg of Versed and 1 mcg of Fentanyl was given
     intravenously during the procedure in small divided doses under continuous
     hemodynamic monitoring. Approximately 25 ml contrast was used during the
                                                                 (Over)

     Reason: please eval trachea for planned intervention                
     Admitting Diagnosis: TRACHAEL OBSTRUCTION
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      46 year old woman with prolonged intubation, now with tracheal stenosis         
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please eval trachea for planned intervention                                    
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CT TRACHEA, [**3130-6-26**]:
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Tracheal stenosis.
     
     Comparison is made to CT chest of [**3130-3-18**].
     
     Helical CT of the central airways was performed without IV or oral contrast
     administration.  Images were initially obtained using a standard dose
     technique at end inspiration.  Subesquently, using a low dose technique, a
     scan was performed during dynamic expiration.
     
     Multiplanar and 3D images will be obtained from the axial data and an addendum
     will be issued to the report when they become available.
     
     There has been interval removal of a tracheostomy tube.  There is extrinsic
     compression of the trachea at the level of the thoracic inlet from enlargement
     of the right lobe of the thyroid gland which measures approximately 3.8 X 3.6
     cm in diameter and contains a dominant low density lesion as well as
     peripheral calcification.  At this level, the trachea is shifted towards the
     left, and demonstrates coronal narrowing with a minimal diameter of
     approximately 6 mm.  The high grade coronal narrowing is only over a short
     segment.  The right thyroid mass extends inferiorly to a level just above
     where the left brachiocephalic vein crosses the midline.  Below the level the
     trachea has a normal coronal and AP diameter.
     
     Dynamic expiratory images demonstrate a component of malacia at the site of
     high grade narrowing with near complete collapse of the trachea at this level
     during dynamic expiration.  Below the level of the thyroid mass the trachea
     demonstrates no evidence of malacia.  Note is made of an area of dependent
     polypoid opacity within the distal trachea on the initial sequences. The
     patient was subsequently asked to cough and this region was reimaged with
     interval change in position of the dependent opacity into the proximal right
     main stem bronchus, consistent with an area of retained secretions.
     
     Assessment of the lungs demonstrates interval improvement in degree of diffuse
     ground-glass opacity and areas of previously noted consolidation have resolved
     in the interval.  There is a residual diffuse interstitial pattern
     characterized by reticulation and septal thickening which is superimposed upon
     underlying changes of emphysema.
     
     The soft tissue structures of the imaged portion of the mediastinum
                                                                 (Over)

     Reason: please eval trachea for planned intervention                
     Admitting Diagnosis: TRACHAEL OBSTRUCTION
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     (Cont)
     demonstrate several mediastinal lymph nodes but show decrease in size compared
     to the previous examination.  Distention of the thoracic esophagus is noted.
     
     Please note that the CT trachea protocol does not involve imaging of the
     entire lungs, but extends only to a few centimeters below the carina.
     
     The skeletal structures of the thorax demonstrate no suspicious lytic or
     blastic skeletal lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  High grade coronal narrowing of the trachea at the level of the thoracic
     inlet, which appears to be predominantly due to extrinsic compression from an
     adjacent right lobe of thyroid enlargement.  The trachea narrows to 6 mm in
     coronal dimension at the site of maximal narrowing.  Additionally, there is
     near complete collapse of this region during dynamic expiration, consistent
     with a component of malacia.
     
     2)  Interval improved appearance of ground-glass opacities and resolution of
     multifocal consolidation, with residual extensive interstitial changes
     diffusely, superimposed upon emphysema.  The interstitial abnormalities likely
     represent residua of the patient's history of prior ARDS.
     
     3)  Enlarged right lobe of thyroid gland containing a dominant low density
     lesion and peripheral calcifications.  Although possibly due to asymmetric
     goiter, thyroid neoplas arising within a goiter should also be considered.
     Thyroid ultrasound may be helpful for initial further assessment of this
     finding.
     
     4)  When available, multiplanar and 3D images will be reviewed and an addendum
     will be issued to the report.
     
     5)  Distention of the thoracic esophagus suggesting the possibility of
     esophageal dysmotility.
     
     ADDENDUM:
     Multiplanar and 3-d images confirm focal tracheal stenosis at the level of the
     thyroid gland, with associated component of malacia at this site during
     dynamic expiration. These images also confirm absence of significant
     abnormality in the central airways below this level.
