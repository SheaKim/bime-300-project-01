Unit No:  833662
Admission Date: [**3302-5-3**]        Discharge Date: [**3302-5-9**]

Date of Birth:  [**3233-5-1**]        Sex:

Service:


ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Status post fall.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Intracranial hemorrhage.

Encephalopathy.

SAD emboli syndrome.

Respiratory failure requiring intubation.

PROCEDURES DURING ADMISSION:  None.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60-year-old
male who presented to [**Hospital6 6531**] Center on
[**3302-5-2**] after having fallen at home. The patient was
lunging in anger and he fell and slipped and reportedly hit
his head. He was worked up at [**Location (un) **] Hospital and found
to have multiple injuries and to be moderately unstable. He
was, therefore, transferred to [**Hospital6 102**] for further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Alzheimer's.

Expressive aphasia.

Asthma.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Depression.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Monopril.
2. Fluoxetine.


ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home with his wife.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient is
afebrile with a temperature of 98.8. His blood pressure was
140 over palpable initially with a pulse in the 70s and
respiratory rate of 23, saturation of 85 percent on room air
with a saturation of 100 percent on a non-rebreather. His
HEENT examination is significant for right periorbital
ecchymosis. His right pupil is 3 mm and reactive. His left
pupil is four to three. He has a GCS of seven. He opens his
eyes spontaneously. He has no verbal response. He extends his
extremities. His C-spine has no step-offs. His tympanic
membranes are clear. His trachea is midline. He has equal
breath sounds. His chest is stable. His heart is regular. His
abdomen is soft, nontender, no pulsatile masses. His pelvis
is stable. His perineum is normal with no wounds. He is
guaiac negative. He has a right humeral step-off and his
right lower extremity is externally rotated. He has two plus
radial pulses and palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior
tibial bilaterally. His back and spine have no step-offs,
abrasions or deformities.

LABORATORY DATA:  Chest x-ray on admission reveals no
pneumothorax or effusion. Pelvis film shows a right femoral
neck fracture. C-spine shows degenerative joint disease. CT
head shows right temporal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage,
as well as subarachnoid hemorrhage just posterior to the
right orbital fracture in the right sylvian fissure. CT
abdomen and pelvis is negative except for a left renal cyst.

On admission labs are significant for an INR of 1.6 and a
calculated hematocrit of 43.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was seen and evaluated in the
Emergency Room by the Trauma team. After imaging, he was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit. He was seen by
several consultants including Neurosurgery, who recommended
keeping his systolic blood pressure less than 140, giving him
Dilantin with a bolus, as well as a standing dose, and
getting a non-contrast head CT in the morning. He was also
seen in consultation by Neurology, who were concerned about
an encephalopathy. They recommended MRI/MRA to be done.
Orthopedics was consulted as well. They felt that his right
humeral fracture should be managed in a splint with three
plain films of the fracture and that his right hip also
needed three plain films but require hemiarthroplasty when
the patient was stable. Ophthalmology also consulted on the
patient and felt that he did not have any compartment
syndrome in his right eye and that there were no
ophthalmologic issues.

On [**3302-5-3**], given the patient's progression of respiratory
failure, he was urgently intubated by Anesthesia without
event. Given his concerning neurological examination, he was
taken for magnetic resonance imaging, which showed acute
small punctate watershed infarcts in the MCA and PCA
territories bilaterally. On [**3302-5-3**], a left subclavian
line was placed with a small left pneumothorax. A chest tube
was also placed to relieve the pneumothorax given the
patient's positive pressure ventilation. The patient had
little neurologic recovery and Neurology felt that the
patient likely had SAD emboli syndrome. He thus underwent an
echocardiogram of his heart, which did reveal a left to right
shunt further supporting their concern for SAD emboli
syndrome. The patient's clinical status did not improve over
the subsequent days. Neurology continued to follow and felt
that he was encephalopathic secondary to the SAD emboli
syndrome.

The patient underwent a transcutaneous Doppler which showed
visible emboli to the brain via the MC and RCA. A family
meeting was held. Given the patient's grave prognosis, the
family decided to make the patient ""Do Not Resuscitate"", ""Do
Not Intubate"". After several more days of no progression and
no purposeful neurologic activity, another family meeting was
held and it was decided to make the patient comfort measures
only. On [**3302-5-9**] at 8:15, the patient expired.

     INDICATION:  Follow up of subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to a similar study obtained on the same day.
     There is a stable appearance of the left subdural hemorrhage.  The appearance
     of the subarachnoid hemorrhage in the posterior right sylvian fissure and in
     the sulci of the right temporal lobe and anteriorly just posterior to the
     orbit is also unchanged.  There is no evidence of hydrocephalus, shift of
     normally mid-line structures, minor or major vascular territorial infarcts.
     
     There is opacification of the frontal air sinus in the right side.  Again
     noted are right-sided orbital fractures with opacification of the right
     maxillary sinus with hyperattenuating material consistent with blood.  Mucosal
     thickening within the ethmoid air cells is also noted.  There is exophthalmos
     on the right.  Overlying soft tissue of the right orbit is again noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Unchanged appearance of the head CT, i.e., stable subarachnoid,
     subdural hemorrhage and right orbital fractures.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS: Subarachnoid hemorrhage, status post fall and status post CVA. 
     
     MRI OF THE CERVICAL, THORACIC AND LUMBAR SPINE:
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1 and T2W images of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar
     spine in addition to inversion recovery sagittal images and T2 axial images in
     the cervical region from C2 through T1 and the lumbar spine from L2 through S1
     were performed.
     
     The examination is partially degraded by motion artifact on all the sequences.
     Cervical spine images reveals exaggeration of the cervical lordosis. There is
     annular bulge at C3-4 level. Moderate cervical spondylosis and disc
     degenerations at seen at C4-5 and C5-6 levels with possible mild narrowing of
     the exit neural foramina.  No disc herniations or extrinsic cord compression
     is seen at any level.
     
     Examination of the thoracic spine reveals minor kyphotic deformity with
     multilevel degeneration of the lower thoracic disc from T8 through T12 levels.
     Overall appearance of the thoracic cord is within normal limits. No disc
     herniations or extrinsic cord compression is seen. The spinal canal is patent
     without significant stenosis.
     
     Examination of the lumbar spine reveals normal vertebral height, signal
     intensity, and alignment.  There is moderate stenosis of the spinal canal at
     L4-5 level due to bulging disc and ligamental hypertrophy.  Bilateral facet
     hypertrophy and annular bulge is seen at L5-S1 level.  Note is made of a dural
     sac cyst in the upper sacral canal at S2 level which is probably of no
     clinical significance.
     
     IMPRESSION:   Limited MRI exam of the cervical and thoracic spine revealing no
     evidence for cord compression. Cervical spondylosis is noted at C4-5 and C5-6
     levels.
     
     Multilevel disc degenerations are seen involving the lower thoracic discs with
     minor kyphotic deformity.
     
     Lumbar spine MRI reveals moderate spinal canal stenosis at L4-5 level and
     bilateral facet hypertrophy at L5-S1 level. No acute disc herniations could be
     demonstrated.
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION: Status post fall, trauma.
     
     COMPARISON: None.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helically aquired axial images were obtained from the lung bases
     through symphysis pubis after the administration of nonionic Optiray contrast.
     Nonionic contrast was used secondary to the trauma nature of the study.  CT
     coronal and sagittal reconstructions were also obtained.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is minimal, bibasilar atelectasis.  There
     is a tiny, hypoattenuating area within the right lobe of the liver which
     likely represents a simple cyst.  There is a hyperattenuating lesion in the
     dome of the liver compatiable with a hemangioma.  The liver is otherwise
     unremarkable without evidence of injury. The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas and
     adrenal glands are unremarkable. There are multiple, hypoattenuating areas
     within both kidneys consistent with simple cysts.  The largest within the
     lower pole of the left kidney measures 6.1 cm and another within the mid pole
     of the left kidney measuring 5 cm. There is no free air, fluid or significant
     lymphadenopathy in the abdomen.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no free air, fluid or significant
     lymphadenopathy in the pelvis.  The abdominal aorta is ectatic and dilates to
     a maximal diameter of 2.8 cm.  The patient is status post prostatectomy. There
     are scattered diverticula throughout the colon without evidence of acute
     inflammation.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There is a right femoral neck fracture with mild external
     angulation of the distal fragment.  There are also extensive degenerative
     changes with osteophyte formation within the lower thoracic and lumbar spine.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  There is no free air or fluid within the abdomen or
     pelvis.  A Foley catheter is seen within the bladder.

     FINDINGS: There are areas of increased signal in the right occipital and in
     the multiple areas in the paramedian convexity. These likely represent acute
     watershed inarctions. Also present are areas of increased signal in the
     periventricular white matter in both cerebral hemispheres as seen on the FLAIR
     images.  This represents remote small vessel infarctions.
      There is no hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures. There is a
     bilateral subdural hemorrhage, right greater than left.
     
     There is opacification of the frontal air sinus on the right side and of the

     HISTORY:  Re-position chest tube.
     
     AP CHEST: Comparison made with 1 day prior.  There is a persistent moderate
     left apical pneumothorax.  A left subclavian central venous catheter is again
     seen, likely in the left brachiocephalic/SVC junction.  Increased linear
     opacity in the left lower lobe, right upper lobe, and right lower lobe, this
     could represent aspiration or atelectasis.  The endotracheal and NG tube
     remain.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There may be a
     small left pleural effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Persistent moderate left apical pneumothorax.  Multifocal
     opacity, some of which may represent atelectasis, others may represent
     aspiration/pneumonia.  There is also likely small basilar portion of the left
     pneumothorax.

     COMPARISON:  11 hours prior.
     
     FINDINGS:  AP portable supine view.  The left apical pneumothorax has
     resolved.  The left chest tube has been repositioned, currently overlying the
     upper left hemithorax.  The heart, mediastinum and pulmonary vessels are
     within normal limits.  The lung parenchyma appear clear.  There is a
     persistent small left pleural effusion.  The visualized osseous structures are
     unchanged.  The nasogastric tube terminates below the left hemidiaphragm.  Its
     side port is not clearly visualized, but it may be at or above the
     gastroesophageal junction.

NPN:  Review of  Systems
Neuro:  Pt does not open eyes, follow commands or move extremities purposefully. Pupils react to light briskly bilaterally.  Right pupil is sometimes slightly larger than left. To nailbed pressure: Pt extends left arm and withdraws LLE. Right arm moves slightly on bed and remains elevated in sling position. Right leg flexes on bed.  Moves feet briskly with any sort of touch to them. Continues on Dilantin.  No seizure activity observed. (+) cough, (-) gag reflex. Bites down w/ mouthcare. Cervical collar changed to [**Location (un) 14**] J collar->no skin breakdown underneath.

Resp: Mechanically ventilated: 700X14, breathing approx [**10-29**] over the vent, Fio2=50%w/ 8 PEEP and 5 PS. BS are very diminished bilaterally to auscultation.  Sxning small to moderate amts of thick, sometimes blood tinged secretions. CT to 20cm wall suction draining s/s fluid.  No crepitus felt over site.

CV: HR 80-90s w/ frequent PVCs despite electrolyte repletion. Cardene drip titrated up to achieve SBP <140, using PRN lopressor to help.Skin warm.  DP/PT pulses palpable bilaterally.  Compression sleeves on. Right radial a-line changed over a wire.  Cardiac echo done.

GI:  Abdomen is soft.  Titrating tubeffedings up as tolerated.  TF changed to impact w/ fiber w/ goal rate of 80cc/hr. (+) bowel sounds.  No BM. IVF dropped to KVO. 

Endo: Regular insulin drip being titrated to achieve blood sugar < 120.  As rate of tubefeedings has increased, need for insulin has also increased.

Skin: Right eye swollen and ecchymotic. Lip ulceration present on right side of mouth.  ETT rotated to left. No pressure wounds present.

GU:  Foley to gravity.  20mg lasix administered as ordered w/ brisk diuresis.  Urine is light yellow. 

Social: Wife, children and daughter-in-law met w/ neurology team to discuss Pt's prognosis. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], SICU Attending , [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 115**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5491**] from social services and myself were present. Family expressed that Pt would not like to be kept on machines.   Pt's code status is now DNR and the plan is to reevaluate Pt's clinical condition several days from now. Family asking appropriate questions and thanked healthcare team for their help. 

A: Hypertensive requiring increased vasodilators. Still unresponsive. tolerating tubefeeds thus far.  

P: Continue to monitor neuro status. Increase cardene to maintain SBP <140 and use lopressor as needed. Diurese as ordered and replete electrolytes as needed. Continue to check OGT aspirates to ensure Tubefeedings are being tolerated. DNR. Reevaluate clinical condition / prognosis next week w/ family.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
              69 year old man s/p s/p CT repositioning                                
                  
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      f/u left PTX

                                     FINAL REPORT
     Compared to [**5-6**].
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Chest tube repositioning.
     
     A single CT is present in the left hemithorax.  There is a large left-sided
     pneumothorax.  Direct comparison is somewhat difficult due to differences in
     patient positioning, but this is probably slightly increased in the interval
     given the fact that the patient is reportedly supine and was previously in an
     upright or semi-erect position.  Evaluation for tension is difficult due to
     leftward rotation of the patient, but there may be slight depression of the
     left hemidiaphragm suggesting a component of tension.
     
     Endotracheal tube and left subclavian vascular catheter in satisfactory
     position.  Atelectatic changes at the left lung base and opacities in the
     right retrocardiac region appear unchanged.  Subcutaneous emphysema has
     increased in the interval in the left chest wall.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Large left pneumothorax with possible tension.  This finding has
     been communicated to the clinical service caring for the patient on the date
     of the study.
