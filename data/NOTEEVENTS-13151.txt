     FINDINGS: Single portable AP view of the chest demonstrates increased
     opacification of the lungs bilaterally, with perihilar haziness, vascular
     septal markings, and peribronchial markings. Additionally, there are bilateral
     effusions, right greater than left, with associated atelectasis. There are no
     focal pulmonary opacities. No pneumothorax. Sternotomy wires and staples are
     seen, suggestive of prior CABG.
     
     IMPRESSION: Congestive failure.

Admission Date:  [**2931-10-27**]     Discharge Date:  [**2931-10-27**]

Date of Birth:   [**2850-7-7**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81 year old male with
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and severe aortic stenosis,
presenting with increasing shortness of breath times thirty
days.  He tried sublingual Nitroglycerin times one which
helped but he kept having shortness of breath after a recent
discharge from C-Medicine for congestive heart failure
exacerbation.  No chest pain, positive orthopnea, positive
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, positive lower extremity edema,
positive constipation, no fever, chills, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea or abdominal pain.  He was brought in by EMS.  He
had a urology appointment the day of admission so was more
active than usual.  In the Emergency Department, he had some
relief with 40 mg of intravenous Lasix with 500cc of urine
output and given 162 mg of Aspirin after the patient had an
episode of chest pain which resolved.  The patient was seen
by Cardiology who recommended gentle diuresis with addition
of low dose Dopamine as he did have severe aortic stenosis
and was preload dependent and was admitted to C-Medicine.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes mellitus.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Gout.
4.  Severe aortic stenosis, valve area 1.1 with a gradient of
42 mmHg.
5.  Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction in [**2915**], status post coronary artery bypass graft
with ejection fraction of 15 to 20%, 2+ mitral regurgitation.
6.  Peripheral vascular disease.
7.  Chronic Foley, status post transurethral resection of
prostate.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Captopril 50 mg three times a day.
2.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Norvasc 5 mg once daily.
4.  Lasix 20 mg twice a day.
5.  Urecholine 25 mg three times a day.
6.  Allopurinol 100 mg three times a day.
7.  Colchicine 0.8 mg twice a day.
8.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.
9.  Amaryl 1 mg p.o. twice a day.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, ethanol or drug use.

Chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly, positive pulmonary edema,
bilateral effusions.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, the patient is in mild
respiratory distress.  Vital signs revealed a temperature of
97, blood pressure 113/58, pulse 101, respiratory rate 20,
93% on four liters nasal cannula.  Head - The pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Extraocular movements are intact.  The oropharynx is clear.
Pulmonary - Rales one half way up bilaterally.  Cardiac -
regular rate and rhythm, III/VI systolic ejection murmur
radiating to the carotids.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities - 2+
bilateral pitting edema.  Neurologically, cranial nerves II
through XII are intact.  Strength is [**4-22**] bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count is 5.8, hematocrit
30.4 which is baseline, platelet count 143,000, neutrophils
26%, bands 1%, 72% lymphocytes, Sodium 125, potassium 4.9,
chloride 94, bicarbonate 20, blood urea nitrogen 71,
creatinine 2.4, baseline is 2.4 to 2.6.  CK 91, troponin less
than 0.3.

Electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block, but has
had left bundle branch block on most previous
electrocardiograms. Sinus tachycardia at 100 beats per
minute.

INITIAL ASSESSMENT:  An 81 year old male with severe aortic
stenosis, coronary artery disease, status post coronary
artery bypass graft with ejection fraction of 15 to 20%,
presenting with shortness of breath and chest x-ray
consistent with congestive heart failure exacerbation.
Because of aortic stenosis, must be careful with diuresis as
he is preload dependent.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was on the floor briefly when
he started to desaturate.  The patient was paced on a 100%
nonrebreathing mask secondary to decreased oxygen saturation
and was hypotensive on Dopamine upon arrival.  The patient
was assessed by the CCU team, was found to be tachycardic
with decreased blood pressure and was moved to CCU to attempt
noninvasive ventilation.  Given that the patient had
previously made it clear that he was DNI, however, he was not
""Do Not Resuscitate"".  Upon arrival to the CCU, noninvasive
ventilation was initiated.  The patient went into PEA arrest
and a cardiac code was called.  ACLS protocol was begun.  The
patient was DNI, however.  Documentation of cardiopulmonary
arrest was provided.  PEA continued.  The patient's pulse
briefly returned.  Upon further discussion with the patient's
family, the patient was made ""Do Not Resuscitate"".  The
patient soon after lost his pulse and unsuccessful
resuscitation was started and shortly discontinued.  The code
duration lasted from 07:40 to 07:57 a.m.  Time of death was
7:57 a.m. on [**2932-10-26**].

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Expired.

     COMPARISON:  [**2931-10-26**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The cardial-pericardial silhouette is enlarged but unchanged.
     Calcification of the transverse aorta is again identified, and the patient is

     Diffuse haziness of the pulmonary vasculature with peribronchial cuffing is
     present and slighlty worse when compared with the prior exam.  Also noted is
     bibasilar air space disease, left greater than right, with obscuration of each
     hemidiaphragm and blunting of each costophrenic angle, all of which is worse.
     No acute bony abnormalities are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly with worsening interstitial edema and bilateral
     pleural fluid collections, consistent with worsening congestive heart failure.
