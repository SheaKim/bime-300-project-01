     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      74 year old woman with recent R brachial embolus, known intra-cardiac thrombus  
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      eval carotid thrombosis

                                     FINAL REPORT
     STUDIES:  Carotid series complete.
     
     REASON:  Recent right brachial embolus, known intracardiac thrombus, evaluate
     for carotid thrombosis.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid arteries.  Minimal plaque was
     identified.  No evidence of thrombus is detected in the cervical carotid
     region.
     
     On the right, peak systolic velocities are 95, 55, and 87 in the ICA, CCA, and
     ECA respectively.  The ICA to CCA ratio is 1.7.  This is consistent with less
     than 40% stenosis.
     
     On the left, peak systolic velocities are 88, 64, and 122 in the ICA, CCA, and
     ECA respectively.  The ICA to CCA ratio is 1.4.  This is consistent with less
     than 40% stenosis.
     
     There is antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.  There is no
     evidence of thrombus or embolus in the cervical carotid system.

     Reason: ARRHYTHMIA, OBSERVE FOR SUSPECTED CAD.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Arrhythmia, observe for suspected coronary artery disease.
     
     SUMMARY OF THE PRELIMINARY REPORT FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:
     
     Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142  
     mg/kg/min. Two minutes after the cessation of infusion, Tc-99m sestamibi was
     administered IV. 
     
     INTERPRETATION:
     Image Protocol: Gated SPECT.
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium-201.
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.
     No EKG changes were noted.
     
     This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model.
     
     The image quality is adequate, limited by colonic hot spot activity.
     
     Left ventricular cavity is mildly enlarged at stress and at rest.
     
     Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the
     myocardium.
     
     No gated images could be obtained secondary to the patient's arrhythmia.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1) Normal myocardial perfusion.  2) Mildly dilated left ventricular
     cavity size with stress and rest.  3) Gating could not be performed secondary
     to the patient's history of arrhythmia.

[**3287-4-15**] Cardiac Catheterization
1.  Coronary angiography of this co-dominant system revealed two 
vessel 
coronary artery disease.  The left main coronary artery was very 
short 
in length and had a 30% stenosis in the proximal vessel.  The 
LAD had a 
40-50% stenosis in the proximal vessel involving the origin of a 
large 
D1 while the D1 had a 50-60% stenosis.  The LCX had no 
angiographically 
apparent flow limiting stenoses.  The RCA had a 70% stenosis in 
the 
proximal vessel. 
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics were performed secondary to the 

incidence of complete heart block with a previous attempt at 
pulmonary 
artery catheterization.  The tricuspid valve was not crossed.  
Right 
sided filling pressures were normal (mean RA pressure was 5 mm 
Hg). 
Left sided filling pressures were mildly elevated (LVEDP was 16 
mm Hg). 
Cardiac index was normal (at 3.2 L/min/m2) (calculated using an 
RA 
oxygen saturation, assuming no intracardiac shunt). 
3.  The aortic valve was evaluated and had a mean gradient of 49 
mm Hg 
and an aortic valve area of 0.8 cm2. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
74F transfer from OSH s/p embolectomy for R brachial emboli, 
h/o severe AS and anemia for cardiac work-up. Pt of Dr. 
[**Last Name (STitle) **], found to have colonic polyps on colonoscopy for anemia 
work-up at OSH. Pt admitted to receive medical clearance for 
future procedure. Found to have UTI, with signs of sepsis severe 
respiratory difficulty and severe aortic stenosis. Admitted to 
MI CU 3/23/5 for respiratory distress intubated on [**3287-3-28**]. 
Found to have UTI with VRE, and e coli multiresistant. At that 
point ID consult was called and recommendations were followed. 
Received full course of antibiotic treatment until bc and UC 
were cleared. Patient was extubated on 3/30/5. Since then 
patient was persistently disoriented, seen by psychiatry 
multiple times diagnosis of delirium was made. We minimized pain 
medications and pt was placed on Haldol for a couple of days. On 
max dose of Haldol he mental status did not improved nor 
sedation was archived so Pt was placed on Ativan that met her 
sedation requirements. Patient since extubation was placed on TF 
to meet her caloric requirements impact with five 3.4 
strength.Pt underwent CATH ON [**3287-4-7**] ABORTED FOR AGITATION OF 
PATIENT
ECHO DONE ON 4 11 05 SHOWING;The left atrium is mildly dilated. 
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. There is 
moderate-to-severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection 
fraction 30 percent). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left 
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is 
severe aortic valve stenosis. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation 
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. 
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity 
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly Underestimated.] 
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired 
relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
There is no pericardial effusion
CATH REPEATED ON 4/12/5 SHOWING:1. Two vessel coronary artery 
disease.
2. Severe aortic stenosis.
We keep pt in ICU monitoring for optimization of her cardiac, 
and nutritional status before surgery aVR.
During this period of time c Diff was send ed several times 
found to be negative. Her mental status remained uncharged, 
having to restrain her and requiring a sitter at all times. Pt 
pulled her feeding tube multiple times.
Finally antibiotic course with Linezolid was archived and 
negative blood and urine cul tires were found to be negative. 
Her nutritional status was improved with transferrin of 174 
albumin of 2.7.

On [**3287-5-7**], Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9279**] was taken to the operating room where she 
underwent an aortic valve replacement utilizing a 21mm 
[**Last Name (un) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial bioprosthesis. Postoperatively 
she was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for 
monitoring. On postoperative day one, Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9279**] [**Last Name (Titles) 875**] and was 
extubated. She was transfused for postoperative anemia. Beta 
blockade was started and titrated for optimal heart rate and 
blood pressure support. She developed atrial fibrillation and 
underwent cardioversion on [**3287-5-10**]. Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9279**] was only able to 
hold a normal sinus rhythm for less then two minutes and 
amiodarone was started. Heparin and coumadin were started for 
anticoagulation with the plan for a repeat cardioversion in a 
month. Tube feeds were started for nutritional support and 
calorie counts were started. On postoperative day seven, Ms. 
[**Known patient lastname 9279**] was transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit 
for further recovery. Se continued to be gently diuresed towards 
her preoperative weight. The physical therapy service was 
consulted for asssistance with her postoperative strength and 
mobility. Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9279**] remained in a rate controlled atrial 
fibrillation and was anticoagulated on heparin. On POD#18 she 
developed BRBPR, her heparin was d/c'd and it resolved. She 
continued to make steady progress, but had some agitation at 
night.  She was followed closely by the geriatric medicine 
service and her medications were adjusted.  She was discharged 
to rehab on POD#34.  She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Dr. 
[**Last Name (STitle) **], her cardiologist and her primary care physician as an 
outpatient.

     INDICATION:  74-year-old woman with hypoxia, status post ventricular pacing
     wire.  Please evaluate for an infiltrate.
     
     Portable AP view of the chest dated [**3287-3-28**], is compared with the
     portable AP view of the chest from [**3287-3-27**], at 20:25.  The endotracheal
     tube remains in satisfactory position.  There has been interval placement of a
     ventricular pacing wire through the previously placed right subclavian venous
     catheter sheath.  The pacing wire appears to terminate in the region overlying
     the right ventricle.  There is persistent prominence of the pulmonary
     vasculature indicating mild congestive heart failure.  There is also an
     increase in the opacity of the retrocardiac space with loss of the left
     hemidiaphragm.  This finding is suggestive of a possible consolidation in the

     Portable AP view of the chest dated [**3287-3-28**], is compared with the
     portable AP view of the chest from [**3287-3-27**], at 20:25.  The endotracheal
     tube remains in satisfactory position.  There has been interval placement of a
     ventricular pacing wire through the previously placed right subclavian venous
     catheter sheath.  The pacing wire appears to terminate in the region overlying
     the right ventricle.  There is persistent prominence of the pulmonary
     vasculature indicating mild congestive heart failure.  There is also an
     increase in the opacity of the retrocardiac space with loss of the left
     hemidiaphragm.  This finding is suggestive of a possible consolidation in the

     effusion.  No other focal opacities are seen.  There is no pneumothorax.

     HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, intubated, atrial fibrillation, in need of
     feeding tube.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Initially we attempted to advance the patient's Dobbhoff feeding
     tube to a  post-pyloric location, which was nor possible.  This was then
     removed and a new weighted feeding tube was advanced into the stomach.
     Initially this was in a post- pyloric location, but then retracted into the
     stomach.  Despite numerous repeated manipulations and approximately 10 minutes
     of active fluoro time, this tube could not be advanced past the pylorus.  At
     this point, the tube was secured in place. Approximately 1-2 cc of water-
     soluble contrast was injected into tube during this procedure.  There were no
     immediate post- procedure complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Placement of nasogastric feeding tube, despite multiple
     manipulations and attempts to obtain a post-pyloric position.  This was
     discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the time of the procedure.

     FINDINGS:
     Study is somewhat limited due to patient motion despite several attempts at
     imaging.  There is no clear and acute intracranial hemorrhage.  There is no
     shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.  The ventricles are
     somewhat prominent consistent with age-related changes.  Hypodensities are
     seen in the periventricular white matter consistent with small vessel ischemic
     disease.  In addition, hypodensities is seen in the bilateral basal ganglia
     consistent with an old lacunar infarcts.  [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation
     elsewhere appears largely preserved.  The osseous structures appear
     unremarkable, though evaluation is limited by motion artifact.  Mucosal
     thickening is seen in both maxillary sinuses.  The soft tissues are
     unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Somewhat limited study due to patient motion, but no evidence of
     acute intracranial hemorrhage.

Pt taken to OR for tooth extraction last noc at 8pm and returned back to SICU at 2055 w/o having procedure done.  Oral surgeon refused to do procedure he stated that he felt that it was unclear whether she would have valve surgery per cards note in chart.  Oral surgeon felt that it would be inappropriate for her to be placed under GA for the extraction if she was eventually not going to have the valve repair.  ICU team and blue surgery team is aware.  Pt family called and was told that the extraction was not done.  Family spoke with MD [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] resident and RN.  Family very concerned about pt's cardiac status and feel that if pt does not have valve surgery she will die.  Pt family also stated that MD [**Doctor Last Name **] stated that her heart needed to be fixed before he could perform surgery family is very concerned about pt and would like to have each team ""get on the same page"" as to pts care.

     Comparison is made to several studies dating back to [**3287-3-27**], most recently
     [**3287-4-7**].
     
     FINDINGS:  A right subclavian central venous catheter is unchanged in position
     with its tip in the distal SVC.  There is minimal bilateral basilar
     atelectasis.  No new focal consolidation is seen.  Pulmonary vasculature is
     within normal limits.  The heart and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance

     INDICATION:  Preop for aortic valve replacement.  Limited IV access. 
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1151**] [**Name (STitle) 643**] with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 602**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 603**] being present and supervising.  The left upper arm was prepped in a
     sterile fashion.  Since no suitable superficial veins were visible, ultrasound
     was used for localization of a suitable vein.  The basilic vein was patent and
     compressible.  After local anesthesia with 2 cc of 1% lidocaine, the basilic
     vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a 21-gauge needle.
     
     A 0.018 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava.
     Based on the markers on the guidewire, it was determined that a length of 40
     cm would be suitable.  The PICC line was trimmed to length and advanced over a
     4 French introducer sheath under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena
     cava.  The sheath was removed.  The catheter was flushed.  Final chest x-ray
     was obtained.  The film demonstrates the tip to be in the superior vena cava
     just above the atrium.
     
     The line is ready for use.
     
     A StatLock was applied and the line was Hep-Locked.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of 40 cm total length double lumen PICC line
     with tip in the superior vena cava, ready for use.

     visualized beyond the inferior edge of the film.  There is a new endotracheal
     tube whose tip lies at the thoracic inlet 7.5-8 mm from the carina.  If
     clinically indicated, it could be advanced approximately about 3 cm for more
     optimal positioning.
     
     A nodular density over the right mid-lung field is unchanged.  There is
     persistent bibasilar atelectasis, with new small pleural effusions,
     particularly on the left.  There is also a slight upper zone redistribution of
     the pulmonary vascularity, with Kerley B lines peripherally consistent with
     pulmonary venous congestion, not significantly changed.  A more confluent
     lingular opacity may represent either atelectasis or consolidation. Also,
     opacity at the right base is increased, and the possibility of developing RLL
     consolidation should be considered.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. New PICC line with tip in the proximal SVC.
     2. New endotracheal tube with the thoracic inlet, which could be advanced for
     more optimal positioning.
     3. New feeding tube in position in the duodenum or beyond.
     4. Bibasilar atelectasis, with increased small pleural effusions and likely
     pulmonary venous congestion.  Continued follow up of lingular opacity is
     suggested. Also increased opacity at the right base could represent a
     developing consolidation, in the appropriate clinical setting.

     INDICATIONS:  74-year-old woman with CHF and critical aortic stenosis, self
     discontinued central venous line, complained of shortness of breath.  Status
     post ET tube placement.
     
     CHEST X-RAY, UPRIGHT AP PORTABLE:  There is no pneumothorax. The previously
     seen right subclavian central venous catheter has been removed.  There is a
     new left- sided PICC line whose tip terminates in the proximal SVC.  A feeding
     tube remains in position, with the tip passing into the duodenum. Its tip not

     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 603**] being present and supervising.  The left upper arm was prepped in a
     sterile fashion.  Since no suitable superficial veins were visible, ultrasound
     was used for localization of a suitable vein.  The basilic vein was patent and
     compressible.  After local anesthesia with 2 cc of 1% lidocaine, the basilic
     vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a 21-gauge needle.
     
     A 0.018 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava.
     Based on the markers on the guidewire, it was determined that a length of 40
     cm would be suitable.  The PICC line was trimmed to length and advanced over a
     4 French introducer sheath under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena
     cava.  The sheath was removed.  The catheter was flushed.  Final chest x-ray
     was obtained.  The film demonstrates the tip to be in the superior vena cava
     just above the atrium.
     
     The line is ready for use.

     Evaluate for CHF or pneumonia.
     
     FINDINGS:  AP single view obtained with patient in supine position is analyzed
     in direct comparison with a similar previous study of [**4-29**].  The signs of
     pulmonary congestion persist and the left sided pleural densities have
     progressed resulting in now complete obliteration of the diaphragmatic
     contours and diffuse density over the left hemithorax explained by fluid
     layering posteriorly.  Less marked pleural densities on the right side but as
     before, perivascular haze and interstitial edema can be seen.  There exist no
     pneumothorax.
       
     As before, extensive wall calcifications in the thoracic aorta suspicion for
     aortic valve calcifications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Progressing signs of CHF with markedly increased pleural
     densities on left side.

     terminating in the right main pulmonary artery.  An NG tube coils in the
     pharynx but then continues down the esophagus and courses below the diaphragm;
     however, its tip is not imaged.  No pneumothorax is seen. The heart is
     enlarged. The mediastinum has widened; however, this may be secondary to the
     postoperative state.  There is a small left lingula opacification. There are
     small bilateral pleural effusions. There is perihilar haziness and prominence
     of the pulmonary vasculature that suggests worsened congestive heart failure.
     The surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Status post median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement with lines and
     tubes as described above.  NG tube coiled in the pharynx before continuing
     down the esophagus.
     
     2.  Worsened CHF since the prior exam.
     
     3.  Mild opacification obscuring the left heart border, likely in the lingula,
     which may represent atelectasis and/or consolidation.
     
     4.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
