Admission Date: [**2778-5-5**]        Discharge Date: [**2778-5-9**]

Date of Birth:  [**2696-4-7**]        Sex:  M

Service:  NME


DATE OF EXPIRATION:  [**2778-5-9**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Acute onset right-sided weakness and
aphasia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82-year-old male with
recent colectomy on [**2778-5-2**] at [**Hospital6 1232**] and
with significant cerebrovascular risk factors who is
transferred for IA tPA and conventional angiogram for acute-
onset aphasia and right-sided weakness.  The history is
obtained from notes as the family is not available at this
time.  The patient underwent colonoscopy after having occult
blood in his stool, which led to diagnosis of likely stage-D
colon adenocarcinoma with liver and omental metastases.  The
patient was doing well until postoperatively today at 2:15
p.m. when he was noted by his wife to be weak in his chair
and not talking.  A neurologist who saw him noted right
hemiparesis and aphasia.  He was apparently following some
commands.  A CT scan showed early signs of infarction,
particularly intracortex, and he is transferred here for
further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Recently diagnosed colon cancer,
status post right colectomy on [**2778-5-2**] with possible liver
and omental metastases.

Coronary artery disease, status post 4-vessel CABG.

Hypertension.

Hypothyroidism.

BPH.

Status post tonsillectomy.

Status post appendectomy.

Status post right hip placement.

Status post TURP.

MEDICATIONS UPON TRANSFER:
1. Aspirin 81 mg by mouth every day.
2. Synthroid 0.05 mg by mouth every day.
3. Heparin subcutaneously twice a day.
4. Lopressor 12.5 mg by mouth twice a day.
5. Terazosin 1 mg by mouth at bedtime.
6. Zofran 4 mg IV/po every 6 hours as needed.
7. Morphine PCA.


MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Diovan.
2. Synthroid.
3. Zocor.
4. Atenolol.
5. Aspirin.


ALLERGIES:  None.

HABITS:  Unknown at this time.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is married with 3 children.  He is a
psychologist and was very active in his research.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Showed no history of stroke in the parents.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination upon admission,
temperature 97.2 degrees, pulse 84 and regular, blood
pressure 142/78, respiratory rate 14.  He is saturating 100
percent, nonrebreather.  Generally, well-appearing elderly
man in no acute distress.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Lungs
are clear to auscultation anteriorly.  Heart has regular rate
and rhythm with 2/6 systolic murmur at the base.  There is no
carotid bruits or ocular bruits audible.  Abdomen is soft,
nontender.  Extremities show no pedal pulses or rashes.  On
mental status exam, the patient opens his eyes, but does not
follow or mimic for me any midline spoke commands.  There is
no verbal output.  Cranial nerve exam, the patient blinks
less from the right.  He blinks well from the left.  Optic
disc could not be visualized well due to small pupils.
Pupils are 2.5 to 1.5 mm reactive to light bilaterally.  Eyes
occasionally seen gazing to the left but does not get to
midline and often has midline gaze.  Corneal reflex intact
bilaterally.  He resists eye opening more forcefully with the
left side of the face than the right.  Right brow and lip is
downturned.  On motor exam, there was markedly increased tone
in the right upper extremity.  On one occasion, there was
tonic contraction of the right arm with tremulousness but no
overt clonic activity.  The right leg is spastic with forced
flexion but foot goes well to rotation.  In the left arm, he
has a sense of gravity, but the right arm does not.  There is
slight flexion of the right hand to pain.  The left leg is
immobilized due to catheterization.  On coordination exam, he
is not able to do finger-to-nose test.  Reflexes, his deep
tendon reflexes are all present and slightly increased in the
right upper extremity.  Plantar responses are extensor
bilaterally.  On sensory exam, his sensation is intact to
pain in all four extremities.  Non-contrast head CT shows
massive cortical distinction in the left intracortex.

LABORATORY DATA:  At the outside hospital, white count 16.3,
hematocrit 34.2, platelets 304, INR 1, PTT 23.8.  Sodium 136,
potassium 4.5, chloride 102, bicarbonate 23, glucose 141, BUN
30, creatinine 1.3, calcium 8.5, magnesium 1.8, phosphate
1.9, CK 329.

Labs at [**Hospital1 10**] showed white
count 11.1, hematocrit 32.2, platelets 273, AST 24, ALT 36,
alkaline phosphatase 38, total bilirubin 0.6, albumin 2.5, CK
346.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the suspicion that the patient had a
left hemispheric stroke, he was sent for a conventional
angiogram, which showed plaque at the bifurcation of the left
internal carotid with poor distal flow.  IA tPA was
administered at the site of plaque but did not result in any
appreciable increase in flow.  Systolic blood pressure was
around 130s to 140s, and he was not given any antiplatelet or
anticoagulation therapy.  Given further discussion with the
family, the family wishes to have the patient comfort
measures only given that the prognosis is poor.  He was put
on a sublingual morphine, sublingual Ativan, and scopolamine.
He then passed away on [**2778-5-9**].

DIAGNOSES:  Left hemispheric stroke.

Metastatic colon cancer.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      82 year old man with colon ca pod #3 s/p colectomy, who sudden onset of right 
      hemiplegia and aphasia, sent from [**Location 5441**] for acute poss. IA TPA.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      carotid or mca stenosis/occlusion, acute tpa candidate                          
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY:
     This is an 82-year-old male patient who now presents with left-sided
     infarction in the left MCA distribution on the MRI. Patient is here for an
     intra-arterial thrombolysis.
     
     Informed consent was obtained from the patient and patient signed after
     explaining the risks, indications and alternative management.
     
     TECHNIQUE:
     Access to the right common fermoral artery was obtained using a Seldinger
     approach. A 6 Fr catheter was placed in the right common femoral artery. 6 Fr
     sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery. Through the sheath, a 5
     Fr pigtail catheter was introduced and aortic arch angiogram was performed.
     Later the catheter was withdrawn and a 4 Fr Berenstein catheter was introduced
     into the right common carotid artery and right common carotid artery angiogram
     was performed. Later the catheter was withdrawn and the left common carotid
     artery was selectively catheterized and arteriogram was performed.
     
     FINDINGS
     
     AORTIC ARCH:
     There is severe tortuosity noted in the origin of the aortic arch.
     
     RIGHT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY:
     Evaluation of the right common carotid artery demonstrates a good flow in the
     distal right internal carotid artery, and right middle and anterior cerebral
     artery. There is cross-filling noted to the left side with almost total
     occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery branches.
     
     LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY:
     Evaluation of the left common carotid artery demonstrates total occlusion of
     the left internal carotid artery approximately 1 to 2 cm from its origin.
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     Delayed images demonstrate reconstitution of the left distal left internal
     carotid artery and opacification of the left anterior cerebral artery branches
     and left M-1 segment. There is total occlusion of the left middle cerebral
     artery at its bifurcation.
     
     At this point, after extensively discussing with the referring stroke
     attending, small amount of  TPA was administered into the stump of the left
     internal carotid artery. (Please refer to the nursing notes for exact dosage.)
     
     At this point the catheter was withdrawn and pressure was held on the right
     groin until hemostasis was obtained. The procedure was uneventful and the
     patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient was sent to the floor with
     orders.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Successful TP administration into the stump of the left internal carotid
     artery.
     2. Angiography demonstrates total occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery
     at its bifurcation.
     3. Please note that this is a redictation. The previous dication was lost

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY:
     This is an 82-year-old male patient who now presents with left-sided
     infarction in the left MCA distribution on the MRI. Patient is here for an
     intra-arterial thrombolysis.
     
     Informed consent was obtained from the patient and patient signed after
     explaining the risks, indications and alternative management.
     
     TECHNIQUE:
     Access to the right common fermoral artery was obtained using a Seldinger
     approach. A 6 Fr catheter was placed in the right common femoral artery. 6 Fr
     sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery. Through the sheath, a 5
     Fr pigtail catheter was introduced and aortic arch angiogram was performed.
     Later the catheter was withdrawn and a 4 Fr Berenstein catheter was introduced
     into the right common carotid artery and right common carotid artery angiogram
     was performed. Later the catheter was withdrawn and the left common carotid
     artery was selectively catheterized and arteriogram was performed.
     
     FINDINGS
     
     AORTIC ARCH:
     There is severe tortuosity noted in the origin of the aortic arch.
     
     RIGHT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY:
     Evaluation of the right common carotid artery demonstrates a good flow in the
     distal right internal carotid artery, and right middle and anterior cerebral
     artery. There is cross-filling noted to the left side with almost total
     occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery branches.
     
     LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY:
     Evaluation of the left common carotid artery demonstrates total occlusion of
     the left internal carotid artery approximately 1 to 2 cm from its origin.
                                                                 (Over)

     Delayed images demonstrate reconstitution of the left distal left internal
     carotid artery and opacification of the left anterior cerebral artery branches
     and left M-1 segment. There is total occlusion of the left middle cerebral
     artery at its bifurcation.
     
     At this point, after extensively discussing with the referring stroke
     attending, small amount of  TPA was administered into the stump of the left
     internal carotid artery. (Please refer to the nursing notes for exact dosage.)
     
     At this point the catheter was withdrawn and pressure was held on the right
     groin until hemostasis was obtained. The procedure was uneventful and the
     patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient was sent to the floor with
     orders.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Successful TP administration into the stump of the left internal carotid

     aspiration pneumonia or CHF.
     
     AP SINGLE VIEW OF THE CHEST:  No comparison available.
     
     FINDINGS:  Note that although the film is labeled as ""upright"", it may not be
     an upright film given the appearance of the gastric air bubble.  The patient
     is status post median sternotomy and CABG. The heart is of normal size for
     technique. The aorta is tortuous and dilated. The pulmonary vascularity is
     within normal limits. There is no definite CHF. There is haziness of the right
     entire hemithorax which most likely represents a layering pleural effusion.
     However, cannot exclude underlying atelectasis or consolidation.  Recommend
     repeating this radiograph in upright position.

     A nasogastric tube is present and terminates below the diaphragm.  There is
     diffuse haziness throughout the right hemithorax compared to the left,
     consistent with a layering right pleural effusion.  However, there also
     appears to be a component of air space disease within the right lung.  The
     left lung is grossly clear, and there is no evidence of left pleural effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Nasogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm.
     2. Layering right pleural effusion, as well as an apparent air space disease
     within the right lung.  The latter could be due to either aspiration or
     pneumonia.  A follow-up upright chest radiograph is recommended to better
     differentiate the degree of pleural and parenchymal disease in this patient.

     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast axial images of the head were obtained from the
     occiput to the vertex.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2778-5-5**] head CT.
     
     HEAD CT:  There is diffuse low attenuation and loss of [**Doctor Last Name 63**]-white matter
     differentiation in the left frontal lobe and part of the left parietal lobe.
     This is consistent with an evolving left hemispheric stroke.  There is no
     acute hemorrhage.  There is narrowing of the sulci in the left hemisphere but
     no shift of normally midline structures.  Bilateral frontal subdural hygromas
     are again noted.  The ventricles and cisterns are unremarkable.  The left
     middle cerebral artery appears dense in comparison to the right.  Bony
     structures, mastoid air cells and visualized paranasal sinuses are
     unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with evolving left middle cerebral artery
     stroke.

     Reason: r/o infiltrate                                              
     Admitting Diagnosis: CAROTID STENOSIS
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
        82 year old man with new L MCA stroke, now gurgling, Question aspiration      
         
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      r/o infiltrate

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Clinical suspicion for aspiration.
     
     A nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach.  Cardiac and mediastinal
     contours are within normal limits and stable.  Diffuse opacity is again
     demonstrated in the right hemithorax, which appears to be due to a combination
     of pulmonary consolidation and a layering right pleural effusion.  The lung
     volumes are slightly improved in the interval since the previous study.
     Allowing for this factor, there is probably no significant change.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Persistent diffuse pulmonary opacity in the right lung as well as
     a layering right pleural effusion.  This may be due to aspiration pnemonia
     given the clinical suspicion for an aspiration event.
