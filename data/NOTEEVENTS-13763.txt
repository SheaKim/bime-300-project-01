History of Present Illness:
   63 y/o M w/mental retardation, schizophrenia, type 2 DM, 
hyperlipidemia, who was brought to the ED [**3295-2-9**] from his NH 
after he was noted to be more lethargic for 2-3 days, and 
febrile to 103. At baseline he is not oriented, but frequently 
yells; however over the past few days had not been as 
interactive. Review of systems unable to be obtained as pt 
doesn't answer questions, but per notes he was simply lethargic. 
Had recently completed course of cephalexin for infected foot 
ulcer.  
*  
   Per his family, he has had a steady decline over the past few 
months and hasn't been walking as much, although per his PCP he 
is able to walk when he wants to.  
*  
   In the ED, he was febrile to 103.4, tachycardic, but 
hemodynamically stable. He was given 4L NS, tylenol, aspirin, 
vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and lopressor. He was noted to have an 
elevated CK, and because of this and fever there was concern for 
neuroleptic malignant syndrome, so he was admitted to the 
Medicine service.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 9625**] is a 63 y/o M w/type 2 DM, schizophrenia, mental 
retardation, admitted with fever, altered mental status, found 
to have elevated CK, dehydration and subsequent hypernatremia.  
It was unclear whether the patient initially presented with NMS. 
 No infectious source was found including clear urine, CXR, CSF 
and negative stool culture. Blood cultures have been negative 
for 4 days.  Notably, the patient returned to his basleine 
mental status by the morning of the second hospital day. At 
baseline the patient is able to answer questions in spanish, to 
request things he wants, and he shouts out frequently for 
""coffee,"" ""water,"" ""cigarettes,"" and ""amigas.""

The patient was followed by both neurology and psychiatry.  It 
was unclear whether the patient had NMS, but his antipsychotics 
were all stopped on admission. On the third hospital day the 
patient received 1mg risperidal twice for aggitation.  As 
psyciatry did not believe the patient had NMS, they recommended 
reintroducing psych meds only slowly.  We have restarted the 
patient on Risperidone 1mg PO qAM and qhs without complication.  
Lithium should be held indefinitely for possible DI as discussed 
below.  Other psych meds should be reintroduced only as needed, 
and will be followed by the patient's PCP as an outpatient.

The patient was resuscitated with 4L NS in the ER and on the 
following morning was found to have a sodium of 154 as well as 
to be polyuric.  His urine osms were 313, which suggests either 
osmotic diuresis secondary to large osmotic load of sodium or 
partial DI perhaps secondary to lithium.   The patient had an 
intact thirst mechanism and was able to drink honey thickened 
water.  He was repleted with D5W (about 2.5L) as well as allowed 
to drink.  The patient's sodium responded well, decreasing to 
147 in 24 hours.  Upon further observation the patient was seen 
to drink a tremendous amount of water (in excess of 9L per day) 
and to put out urine in accordance with that intake (about 9L 
per day).  The patient likely has a component of partial 
Diabetes Insipidus, likely secondary to lithium (either central 
or nephrogenic, as both are possible in the presence of 
lithium).  We did not pursue or work this up further as the 
patient proved he was able to drink as needed to return his 
sodium to normal and maintain normal sodium.  The patient should 
be allowed ot drink honey thickened water as an outpatient as 
liberally as his thirst requires.  Lithium should be held 
indefinitely.
*  
The patient was kept on aspiration precautions following an 
aspiration event reported by nursing in the ER.  He failed 
initial swallow study but follow up video study showed that he 
could drink honey-thickened liquids and pureed foood with 1:1 
supervision and the use of a spoon but not a straw.  This diet 
should continue.

For his elevated CK and troponin the patient was medically 
managed with his usual home cardiac meds.  His PCP may work this 
up further after this acute hospitalization.  Due to his 
elevated CK his lipitor was stopped upon admission and is not 
being restarted at this time.  The patient's PCP may restart 
this if CKs normalize as an outpatient.

The patient's diabetes control was challending while he was on 
D5W, however he was kept on an insulin side scale and will 
restart his oral meds on discharge.

CPK enzymes decreases in the future.

Please remove the patient's foley catheter upon arrival to ECF.

Please allow the patient to drink water thickened to honey 
consistency according to his thirst.  The patient likely has 
partial diabetes insipidus and will drink a great deal to keep 
up with urine output.

honey consistency only as he aspirates otherwise.

Please continue medications as directed.  The patient's primary 
care physician will follow as an outpatient to reintroduce 
psychiatric medications as needed safely.
