Admission Date:  [**3412-9-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**3412-9-11**]

Date of Birth:   [**3379-2-9**]     Sex:  M

Service:  [**Company **]-MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 33 year old African
American male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1,
severe gastroparesis and hypertension, who presented to the
Emergency Department with his usual epigastric pain and
intractable vomiting.  In the Emergency Department, he was
found to have a blood pressure of 250/150, and heart rate in
the 90s.  He was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 392**] with a recent admission for
gastroparesis and upper gastrointestinal bleed.  He now
returns with nausea, vomiting but no chest pain, no shortness
of breath, no melena, no bright red blood per rectum, no
coffee ground emesis.

His electrocardiogram in the Emergency Department showed ST
elevations in V2 and V3 which were unchanged from previous
electrocardiogram.  He continued to be greatly hypertensive
in the Emergency Department with additional complaints of
light-headedness which necessitated direct admission to the
CCU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes mellitus type 1.
2.  Severe gastroparesis requiring multiple admissions in the
past, gastric emptying study in [**3412-5-2**], reveals severe
gastroparesis.
3.  Gastritis with negative H. pylori.
4.  Esophageal ulcer.
5.  Coronary artery disease.
6.  Hypertension which has been exceptionally difficult to
control.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Reglan 10 mg p.o. four times a day.
2.  Protonix 40 mg once daily.
3.  Lisinopril 10 mg once daily.
4.  Lopressor 50 mg three times a day.
5.  Insulin NPH 10 units q.a.m. and q.p.m.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a former truck driver,
currently not working.  He lives with girlfriend.  No smoking
or alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, vital signs
revealed temperature 98.6, heart rate 99, blood pressure
180/117, respiratory rate 17, oxygen saturation 100%.  In
general, the patient is somewhat somnolent.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat - sluggish pupils.  The oropharynx is
clear.  Cardiovascular - tachycardia, S1 and S2, no murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  Pulmonary clear to auscultation bilaterally
with poor respiratory effort.  The abdomen is soft,
nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.  No
liver edge.  Extremities no edema, good 2+ dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibial pulses.  Neurologic examination - alert and
oriented times three, somewhat somnolent.  Reflexes
symmetrical but decreased.  Cranial nerves II through XII are
intact.  Motor strength is preserved.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count 9.6,
hematocrit 2.3, platelet count 232,000.  Chem7 is remarkable
for blood urea nitrogen of 24, and creatinine 1.7.  Liver
function tests were within normal limits.  CK was 300 and
troponin less than 0.3.

Chest x-ray revealed no acute process.  Head CT revealed no
acute bleed or mass lesion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular - The patient was admitted to CCU for
blood pressure control.  He was started on Labetalol drip
which resulted in immediate significant drop in his blood
pressure requiring discontinuation of the Labetalol.
Following this, he was started on Nipride drip with
relatively good control, but over the first 24 hours, his
blood pressure returned to [**Location 2541**] and all drips were
subsequently discontinued.  At this point, autonomous testing
was arranged and the patient was found to have severe
autonomic dysfunction.  Given this finding, it was believed
that he would benefit from pyramidal corticoids which was
Florinef on which he was started.  In the meantime, his beta
blocker and ace inhibitor were currently discontinued.  His
blood pressure well controlled after that.  He required only
the addition of Clonidine patch.  After the first 24 hours in
the CCU, he was relatively stable and ready for transfer to
the medical floor.

On the medical floor, his blood pressure was well controlled
and although a little bit elevated around 140 to 160
systolic, it showed no fluctuation which has been so
troubling to him in the past.

2.  Gastrointestinal - The patient had little to no
complaints of gastrointestinal upset, nausea or vomiting.  He
was able to tolerate a full p.o. diet.

3.  Renal - He remained relatively stable from the renal
standpoint with no fluctuation in creatinine.

4.  Endocrine - The patient was seen by the [**Last Name (un) 720**] consult
service who felt he might have a flat [**Last Name (un) **] type I B diabetes
mellitus.  Apparently historically, he has responded somewhat
to oral hypoglycemics in the past suggesting that he might
not have typical type 1 picture.  He will be followed by the
[**Hospital 720**] Clinic after discharge.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Gastroparesis.
2.  Autonomic dysfunction.
3.  Hypertensive urgency.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Clonidine patch 0.1 q.weekly.
2.  Florinef 0.1 mg once daily.
3.  Reglan 10 mg four times a day.
4.  Protonix 40 mg once daily.
5.  NPH 10 units twice a day.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Thirty-three year old man with diabetes mellitus, who underwent a  
     gastric emptying study approximately six weeks ago which showed gastroparesis
     and now presents after therapy.
      
     INTERPRETATION: 
      
     Following the oral ingestion of a meal of radiolabeled egg-whites, the patient
     was placed supine beneath the gamma camera.  Multiple anterior and posterior
     images of the tracer activity in the stomach and bowel were recorded for 60
     minutes. 
      
     Region of interest analysis of the tracer activity in the stomach shows minimal
     emptying of stomach contents after two hours of imaging.  Incidental note is
     made of tracer uptake seen within the esophagus signifying delayed entry of
     tracer into the stomach.
      
     In comparison to the previous study performed in [**3412-5-2**], there has been no
     significant interval change.
      
     IMPRESSION:  Severe gastroparesis with no improvement from prior study. /nkg

      Please place

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  33 year old man with gastroparesis, diabetes mellitus and
     hypertension requiring percutaneous jejunostomy tube.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the
     patient and informed written consent was obtained.  The procedure was
     performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 106**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 456**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 106**] present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     The patient was placed supine on the angiography table and the left superior
     abdomen was prepped and draped using standard sterile technique.  The stomach
     was insufflated through a pre-existing nasogastric tube.  After a suitable
     location was determined (and after examination of prior CT scan), under
     fluoroscopic guidance an 18-gauge needle was inserted into the stomach through
     a percutaneous approach.  A small amount of air refluxed from the needle
     consistent with intraluminal position.  A T-fastener was deployed.  This was
     repeated an additional time.  A third puncture was then made into the stomach
     under fluoroscopic guidance and a 0.035 straight [**Last Name (un) 193**] wire was then
     advanced into the stomach.  The needle was exchanged for a 7-French bright-tip
     sheath and a multipurpose 5-French catheter was then advanced over the wire
     into the stomach under fluoroscopic guidance.  The wire and catheter were then
     advanced past the ligament of Treitz and the wire exchanged for a J Amplatz
     Super Stuff wire.  The tract was then serially dilated up to 12 French and a
     14-French peel-away sheath was then advanced over the wire.  A 14-French 63-
     cm-long [**Doctor Last Name 217**] gastrojejunostomy tube was then advanced past the ligament of
     Treitz under fluoroscopic guidance over the wire.  The wire was removed.  A
     small amount of contrast (approximately 15 cc of non-ionic Optiray contrast
     was administered through the tube and a post-placement radiograph documented
     appropriate jejunal positioning of the tube tip.  The tube was secured to the
     skin using a single Prolene suture and a FlexiTrack.  The patient tolerated
     the procedure well and there were no immediate post-procedure complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Status post successful percutaneous placement of a 14-French
     [**Doctor Last Name 217**] gastrojejunostomy tube.

      33 year old man with gastroparesis and HTN, needs j-tube                        
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please place

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  33 year old man with gastroparesis, diabetes mellitus and
     hypertension requiring percutaneous jejunostomy tube.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the
     patient and informed written consent was obtained.  The procedure was
     performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 106**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 456**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 106**] present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     The patient was placed supine on the angiography table and the left superior
     abdomen was prepped and draped using standard sterile technique.  The stomach
     was insufflated through a pre-existing nasogastric tube.  After a suitable
     location was determined (and after examination of prior CT scan), under
     fluoroscopic guidance an 18-gauge needle was inserted into the stomach through
     a percutaneous approach.  A small amount of air refluxed from the needle
     consistent with intraluminal position.  A T-fastener was deployed.  This was
     repeated an additional time.  A third puncture was then made into the stomach
     under fluoroscopic guidance and a 0.035 straight [**Last Name (un) 193**] wire was then
     advanced into the stomach.  The needle was exchanged for a 7-French bright-tip
     sheath and a multipurpose 5-French catheter was then advanced over the wire
     into the stomach under fluoroscopic guidance.  The wire and catheter were then
     advanced past the ligament of Treitz and the wire exchanged for a J Amplatz
     Super Stuff wire.  The tract was then serially dilated up to 12 French and a
     14-French peel-away sheath was then advanced over the wire.  A 14-French 63-
     cm-long [**Doctor Last Name 217**] gastrojejunostomy tube was then advanced past the ligament of
     Treitz under fluoroscopic guidance over the wire.  The wire was removed.  A

     INDICATION: 33 year old man with diabetes mellitus s/p G tube placement two
     weeks previously with fever and chills and purulent drainage from the tube
     site.
     
     CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST:
     
     COMPARISON: Prior study performed [**3412-5-17**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: Contiguous serial axial images were obtained from the lung bases
     through the pubic symphysis without contrast.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: The visualized lung bases demonstrate patchy
     bibasilar opacities.  Noncontrast evaluation of the liver, gallbladder,
     pancreas, spleen, adrenals and kidneys are grossly unremarkable.  A
     gastrostomy tube is present passing through the left anterior abdominal wall.
     There is extensive inflammatory changes within the subcutaneous fat tracking
     along the lateral and posterior left abdominal wall.  Air is present adjacent
     to the tube as is passes through the subcutaneous fat.  A small, 0.9 x 2.6 cm
     fluid collection is present at the most inferior aspect of the area of
     inflammatory change.  No intraabdominal abscess or free fluid is identified.
     Intraabdominal loops of large and small bowel are grossly unremarkable. There
     are small retroperitoneal lymph nodes.  Incidental note is made of a small
     right anterior abdominal wall lipoma anterior to the rectus abdominus muscle.
     There are dense vascular calcifications.

     weeks previously with fever and chills and purulent drainage from the tube
     site.
     
     CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST:
     
     COMPARISON: Prior study performed [**3412-5-17**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: Contiguous serial axial images were obtained from the lung bases
     through the pubic symphysis without contrast.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: The visualized lung bases demonstrate patchy
     bibasilar opacities.  Noncontrast evaluation of the liver, gallbladder,
     pancreas, spleen, adrenals and kidneys are grossly unremarkable.  A
     gastrostomy tube is present passing through the left anterior abdominal wall.
     There is extensive inflammatory changes within the subcutaneous fat tracking
     along the lateral and posterior left abdominal wall.  Air is present adjacent
     to the tube as is passes through the subcutaneous fat.  A small, 0.9 x 2.6 cm
     fluid collection is present at the most inferior aspect of the area of
     inflammatory change.  No intraabdominal abscess or free fluid is identified.
     Intraabdominal loops of large and small bowel are grossly unremarkable. There
     are small retroperitoneal lymph nodes.  Incidental note is made of a small
     right anterior abdominal wall lipoma anterior to the rectus abdominus muscle.
     There are dense vascular calcifications.

      J-tube placement [**3412-12-25**] by IR.  J-tube became infected, now d/c'd with penrose 
      drain placed by [**Hospital Unit Name 2778**].  On Vanc and Zosyn for antibiotics, will need long 
      course.  Horrible access-now has tenuous left fem line.                         
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS: Type I diabetes, complicated by gastroparesis necessitating G-J
     tube placement. The G-J tube entry site became infected one week after
     placement and was initially treated medically with subsequent decrease in
     symptoms. With recurrent infection at two weeks now, the patient requires long
     term antibiotics, and IV team was not able to place a PICC at bedside.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 192**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 107**] [**Name (STitle) 108**]. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 107**] [**Name (STitle) 108**], the staff
     radiologist, supervised the procedure.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 126**] reviewed the exam.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Patient was informed of the details and associated
     risks of the procedure and written consent was obtained. The patient was
     placed supine on the angiographic table and his left arm was sterilely prepped
     and draped in the usual fashion. Since there were no appropriate superficial
     veins visible, ultrasound was used. Ultrasonography demonstrated a patent and
     compressible brachial vein, but the basilic vein was not well shown. Under
     ultrasonographic guidance, the left brachial vein was assessed using a
     micropuncture needle. Under fluoroscopic guidance an 0.018 guidewire was
     advanced through the puncture needle and positioned within the superior vena
     cava (SVC). The puncture needle was then exchanged for a 5 French peel- away
     sheath under fluoroscopic guidance. The guidewire was measured from entry site
     to SVC and it was determined that a 46 cm length would be appropriate. The
     double lumen 5 French PICC catheter was trimmed accordingly. The PICC was then
     advanced through the peel away sheath over an 0.018 wire and positioned with
     the tip at the SVC. The catheter was demonstrated to flush and aspirate well.
     The catheter was secured with a Stat- Lock and bandaged with a dressing. There
     were no immediate complications and the patient tolerated the procedure well.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of 46 cm-long, 5 French, double lumen PICC
     via the left brachial vein. The tip is at the SVC and the catheter is ready
     for use.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      33 year old man with type I DM, complicated by gastroparesis, necessitating 
      J-tube placement [**3412-12-25**] by IR.  J-tube became infected, now d/c'd with penrose 
      drain placed by [**Hospital Unit Name 2778**].  On Vanc and Zosyn for antibiotics, will need long 
      course.  Horrible access-now has tenuous left fem line.                         
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please place PICC-pt failed bedside eval by IV nurse                            
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS: Type I diabetes, complicated by gastroparesis necessitating G-J
     tube placement. The G-J tube entry site became infected one week after
     placement and was initially treated medically with subsequent decrease in
     symptoms. With recurrent infection at two weeks now, the patient requires long
     term antibiotics, and IV team was not able to place a PICC at bedside.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 192**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 107**] [**Name (STitle) 108**]. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 107**] [**Name (STitle) 108**], the staff
     radiologist, supervised the procedure.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 126**] reviewed the exam.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Patient was informed of the details and associated
     risks of the procedure and written consent was obtained. The patient was
     placed supine on the angiographic table and his left arm was sterilely prepped
     and draped in the usual fashion. Since there were no appropriate superficial
     veins visible, ultrasound was used. Ultrasonography demonstrated a patent and
     compressible brachial vein, but the basilic vein was not well shown. Under
     ultrasonographic guidance, the left brachial vein was assessed using a
     micropuncture needle. Under fluoroscopic guidance an 0.018 guidewire was
     advanced through the puncture needle and positioned within the superior vena
     cava (SVC). The puncture needle was then exchanged for a 5 French peel- away
     sheath under fluoroscopic guidance. The guidewire was measured from entry site
     to SVC and it was determined that a 46 cm length would be appropriate. The
     double lumen 5 French PICC catheter was trimmed accordingly. The PICC was then
     advanced through the peel away sheath over an 0.018 wire and positioned with
     the tip at the SVC. The catheter was demonstrated to flush and aspirate well.
     The catheter was secured with a Stat- Lock and bandaged with a dressing. There
     were no immediate complications and the patient tolerated the procedure well.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of 46 cm-long, 5 French, double lumen PICC

     [**Last Name (STitle) 1243**], the attending radiologist, supervising.  The patient's right upper arm
     was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  Since there were no obvious
     superficial veins, ultrasound was used to find a compressible and patent right
     basilic vein.  1% Lidocaine was injected subdermally for local analgesia.
     Under sonographic guidance, the left basilic vein was cannulated with a 21
     gauge needle and a 0.035 wire was advanced into the SVC under fluoroscopic
     guidance.  A 5 Fr peel-away sheath was placed into the basilic vein.  The
     distance from the skin incision to the SVC was measured at 32 cm.  A 5 Fr
     double lumen PICC was trimmed to the appropriate length and advanced under
     fluoroscopic guidance into the distal SVC.  The placement was confirmed with a
     fluoroscopic spot film.  Both ports flush and withdraw normally.  The puncture
     site was cleaned and dressed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.
     There were no immediate complications.  The line is ready for use.

     DEDICATED PELVIC EXAMINATION WITH CYSTO.
     
     INDICATION:  Patient with diabetes and severe gastroparesis.  The patient has
     a ventral hernia.  The request is to do a CT cystogram to assess for
     communication between bladder and umbilical hernia.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helical contiguous axial images were obtained at the level of the
     umbilicus in the supine and right decubitus positions.  500 cc of diluted
     contrast material was infused into the urinary bladder.
     
     COMPARISON:  Previous examination from [**3413-1-15**].
     
     LIMITED STUDY OF THE PELVIS WITH NO IV CONTRAST.
     
     After infusion of 500 cc of diluted contrast material, the urinary bladder is
     big and reaching the area of the umbilicus.  No connection is noticed between
     the urinary bladder and the umbilicus.  There is a fluid-filled, well-
     demarcated area within an area of ventral hernia near the umbilicus. No
     connection is noticed between this area and the bowel. This finding is
     consistent with a hernia with an urachal cyst.  There are no signs of wall
     thickening or fat stranding around it.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Ventral hernia which contains urachal cyst.  There is no
     connection between the hernia and the [**Last Name (un) 5125**] or the urinary bladder.

     vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a 21-gauge needle.  A

     HISTORY:  Thirty-four year old male with type 1 DM,  hypertension and coronary 
     artery disease with elevated Troponin during a hypertensive episode. 
      
     SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB: 
     Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142 
     mg/kg/min. Two minutes after the cessation of infusion, Tc-99m sestamibi was
     administered IV. 
      
     INTERPRETATION:  
     Image Protocol: Gated SPECT. 
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium-201. 
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images. 
      
     Stress images show normal left ventricular cavity size.  There are decreased
     counts in the anterior wall.  The apex is preserved.  No other defects are
     identified. 
      
     Resting perfusion images demonstrate a mild decrease in counts involving the
     anterior wall, the apex is preserved. 
      
     Ejection fraction calculated from gated SPECT obtained after Dipyridamole
     administration is 54%.  No wall motion abnormality. 
      
     There is a prior study dated [**3412-5-8**], the defect involving the anterior wall is
     again identified, and is most likely secondary to attenuation.  This finding is
     unchanged. 
      
     IMPRESSION:  Normal pharmacological stress test, with no wall motion abnormality
     and an EF of 54%.

Micu Nursing Admission Note
34 year-old male admitted from EW with hypertensive urgency.  

Past Medical History:  Type 1 diabetes; diabetic gastroparesis; autonimic neuropathy; chronic renal insuficiency; mild coronar artery disease; HTN.

Allergies:  NKDA

Review of systems:  Cardiac-  on admission he was on IV NTG at 2.66 mcg/min and labetolol 2.0mg/min with a B/P of 164/90,HR 95.  He C/O sever abdominial pain and received MSO4 4mg and ativan 2 mg IVP.  This is a usual complaint and he received a total of 8 mg MSO4 and 4mg ativan in the EW.  Following the administration of these meds he fell asleep and his B/P started to fall.  The labetolol was weaned to off by 1635 and the NTG was weaned to off by 1645.  His B/P has been 119-128/61-64 with no C/O abdominal pain.  HR has been 88-91 SR>

Resp:  He has had RR 12-15 following the pain meds.  Breath sounds are clear with O2 sat of 94-95% on room air.

GI:  Abd soft and non tender with very hypoactive bowel sounds.  He C/O nausea on admission but no vomiting in the Micu.

GU:  Pt was able to void over 1L on admission.  He received 1800cc NS in the EW.  His urine was clear yellow and a U/A was sent.

Neuro:  Pt was alert and oriented on admission.  He is very quiet answering questions in one or two words answers.  He MAE and was able to stand to void without assistance.

Lines:  Pt has a port-a-cath in the left that was accessed in the EW.
