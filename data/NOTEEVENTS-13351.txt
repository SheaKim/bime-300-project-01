DISCHARGE ADDENDUM COVERING DATES [**2-3**] THROUGH [**2-16**]:

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Renal:  The patient continued on
hemodialysis for end stage renal disease.  She had developed
calciphylaxis and had this initially managed with daily
hemodialysis and AntaGel to reduce her phosphate levels.  She
did not have a biopsy of her calciphylaxis areas due to
increased risk of infection.  She was evaluated on [**2-2**] by the General Surgery team who recommended
parathyroidectomy.  The patient underwent this procedure on
[**2586-2-13**].  The details of this procedure can be seen in
the operative note.  The patient was also evaluated by the
Plastic Surgery team who followed the patient's calciphylaxis
as well as a sacral decubitus ulcer.  No procedures were done
by this service during the [**Hospital 101**] hospital stay.

Cardiology:  The patient was consulted by the Cardiology
Service for risk assessment prior to her parathyroidectomy.
The patient was continued on her Lopid and her enteric coated
aspirin 325 mg po q day and was started on beta blocker and
ace inhibitor as per cardiology recommendations.  The patient
had a stress test done as part of her preoperative workup,
which was negative for a reversible perfusion defect.  The
patient seemed to tolerate surgery well, however, on
postoperative day number three the patient experienced
shortness of breath and chest pain.  The patient then
developed ventricular arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock.  A
code was called and the Cardiology Service was called to
assist with management of the patient.  The patient had a
prolonged arrest with incessant ventricular fibrillation
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and runs of monomorphic
ventricular tachycardia.  Despite high dose pressors,
intravenous Amiodarone and Lidocaine the patient expired with
asystole pulseless electrical activity and severe acidosis.

The family agreed to partial autopsy after the patient's
demise with examination of the heart.  The pathology report
can be reviewed separately.  The patient was pronounced dead
at 6:30 a.m. on [**2586-2-16**].

     CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS [**2585-12-19**].
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  End stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis with a
     clotted PD catheter.  Low grade fevers, increasing white blood count and
     tenderness on abdominal exam today.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT images were acquired from the lung bases through the pubic
     symphysis without IV contrast.  Delayed CT images of the abdomen and pelvis
     were obtained three hours later in a supine and left side down decubitus
     position.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is bibasilar atelectasis and a
     trace right pleural effusion.  There are extensive calcifications of the
     abdominal aorta, bilateral renal arteries, celiac axis, and mesenteric
     arteries.  There is a small amount of perihepatic subcapsular fluid and fluid
     tracking within the right paracolic gutter.  The kidneys are atrophic.  The
     gallbladder is somewhat prominent which may be consistent with a fasting
     state.  The liver, spleen, stomach, and visualized portions of large and small
     bowel are unremarkable.  There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric
     lymphadenopathy.  There is no free air within the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is free air within the pelvis
     adjacent to a peritoneal dialysis catheter.  This air extends proximal to the
     sigmoid colon.  There is linear air adjacent to or within the wall of the
     sigmoid colon.  This air does not move despite three hour delayed imaging in
     both a supine and left side down decubitus position.  There is no evidence of
     colonic wall thickening.  The visualized portion of small bowel appears
     normal.  There are extensive calcifications of the distal abdominal aorta, and
     iliac arteries.
     
     Osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1) Persistence of air within the sigmoid colon wall
     suggests pneumatosis coli.
     2) Free air within the pelvis associated with the peritoneal dialysis
     catheter.
     3) Small amount of fluid scattered throughout the abdomen.  SBP cannot be
     excluded.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Follow up study in patient with abdominal pain, elevated white
     count, and pneumatosis coli seen on prior study.
     
     COMPARISONS: [**2585-12-19**]
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases to the pubic symphysis without the administration of IV contrast.
     
     CT ABDOMEN W/O IV CONTRAST:  Bibasilar atelectasis and trace right pleural
     effusion is again seen. Re-demonstration of extensive calcifications of the
     abdominal aorta, renal arteries, celiac axis, and mesenteric arteries.  A
     small amount of free fluid is seen in the pelvis amid the bowel loops, and
     tracking along the lateral margin of the spleen. The kidneys are atrophic. The
     gallbladder is prominent however, there is no wall thickening or
     pericholecystic fluid.  The liver, spleen, stomach, and visualized portions of
     large and small bowel loops in the abdomen are unremarkable.  There is no
     lymphadenopathy present.
     
     CT PELVIS W/O IV CONTRAST:  Peritoneal dialysis catheter is again seen with
     tip positioned in the posterior right pelvis.  There is a loop of sigmoid
     colon which demonstrates air within the bowel wall and is unchanged in
     appearance. In addition, there is air tracking within the mesocolon which
     again appear unchanged when compared to prior study.  There is no wall
     thickening, fat stranding, or fluid collections in the region of the bowel
     wall air or along the course along the peritoneal catheter.  Trace fluid is
     seen in the pelvis.  There is no air tracking along the antidependent portion
     of the peritoneal cavity.
     
     IMPRESSION:
          Stable appearance of pneumatosis coli in the sigmoid colon and air in the
     mesocolon. Given that there is no wall thickening, or evidence of
     inflammation, and that the air is remaining within the mesocolon and not
     present in the peritoneum, the patient's peritoneal signs and symptoms appear
     at this time to be unrelated to the air in the bowel wall.  Air in the bowel
     wall is a nonspecific finding and can be seen idiopathically, in patient's on
     steroids, diabetics, and reportedly in patient's after multiple enemas.
     Recommendation at this time is to repeat the abdominal CT scan in 2 days for
     follow up.

     perhaps slight decrease in the amount of air tracking within the mesocolon. In
     the interval, since the prior study, there appears to be some bowel wall
     thickening in portions of the sigmoid and descending colon in regions proximal
     to the focus of pneumatosis.  Given the extent of this wall thickening, this
     is unlikely to represent an ischemic process and more likely represents
     pseudomembranous colitis in patient on iv antibiotics.  There is focal wall
     thickening along the lateral left urinary bladder wall of uncertain etiology
     and could represent an infectious focus.  Stable appearance of free fluid and
     position of peritoneal dialysis catheter.  Again, there is no air tracking in
     the antidependent portion of the peritoneal cavity.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Minimal interval decrease in extent of air within the sigmoid colon wall
     and within the mesocolon.  There appears to be increased wall thickening along
     a large extent of sigmoid and descending colon, most likely representing
     pseudomembranous colitis.  A follow-up study in two days is recommended.

     HISTORY:  Continued low grade fevers, increasing WBC and tenderness on
     abdominal exam.
     
     COMPARISONS: [**12-19**], [**12-20**] and [**2585-12-22**]
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis
     using 150 cc Optiray IV contrast (dialysis).
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is bibasilar atelectasis and a trace right
     pleural effusion.  There is a small amount of subcapsular perihepatic ascites
     and fluid tracking within the bilateral paracolic gutters.  The liver, spleen,
     pancreas, adrenals, stomach, visualized portions of large and small bowel are
     unremarkable. There are multiple bilateral low attenuation renal lesions,
     which most likely represents simple renal cysts.  There are extensive arterial
     vascular calcifications.  There is no abdominal free air.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a large cystic pelvic mass measuring
     10.7 x 8.5 cm, previously thought to be the bladder.  The mass contains high
     attenuation fluid ( [**Doctor Last Name **] 27 ).
     
     Again seen is a peritoneal dialysis catheter with its tip proximal to the
     sigmoid colon.  There is interval decrease in sigmoid colonic wall air.  The
     sigmoid and descending colon again demonstrates wall thickening, and are
     little changed in appearance from the two day interval. There is minimal
     remaining free air within the pelvis.
     
     The osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Large cystic pelvic mass, previously thought to be the bladder, concerning
     for ovarian cancer.
     2) Continued decreasing amount of air within the sigmoid colon wall with
     adjacent thickening of the sigmoid and descending colonic walls.  The

     abdominal exam.
     
     COMPARISONS: [**12-19**], [**12-20**] and [**2585-12-22**]
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis
     using 150 cc Optiray IV contrast (dialysis).
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is bibasilar atelectasis and a trace right
     pleural effusion.  There is a small amount of subcapsular perihepatic ascites
     and fluid tracking within the bilateral paracolic gutters.  The liver, spleen,
     pancreas, adrenals, stomach, visualized portions of large and small bowel are
     unremarkable. There are multiple bilateral low attenuation renal lesions,
     which most likely represents simple renal cysts.  There are extensive arterial
     vascular calcifications.  There is no abdominal free air.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a large cystic pelvic mass measuring
     10.7 x 8.5 cm, previously thought to be the bladder.  The mass contains high
     attenuation fluid ( [**Doctor Last Name **] 27 ).
     
     Again seen is a peritoneal dialysis catheter with its tip proximal to the
     sigmoid colon.  There is interval decrease in sigmoid colonic wall air.  The
     sigmoid and descending colon again demonstrates wall thickening, and are
     little changed in appearance from the two day interval. There is minimal
     remaining free air within the pelvis.
     
     The osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Large cystic pelvic mass, previously thought to be the bladder, concerning
     for ovarian cancer.
     2) Continued decreasing amount of air within the sigmoid colon wall with
     adjacent thickening of the sigmoid and descending colonic walls.  The
     differential diagnosis continues to include pseudomembraneous colitis and
     ischemic colitis.
     3) Small amount of ascites.
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  54-year-old woman with diabetes ESRD non-working peritoneal dialysis
     catheter persisting abdominal pain CT scan showing pelvic mass.
     
     PELVIC ULTRASOUND:  Transabdominal and transvaginal scanning were performed.
     Transvaginal scanning was performed for better visualization of the ovaries. A
     10.4 x 8.9 x 9.4 cm mass is identified in the pelvis which contains several
     septations.  No color flow is demonstrated within the septations, minimal flow
     is identified along the borders of the mass.  Low level internal echos are
     seen throughout the mass.  The patient is S/P subtotal hysterectomy.  Several
     nabothian cysts are seen within the cervix.  The patient is S/P unilateral
     oophorectomy.  The remaining ovary is not visualized.  The kidneys are small
     bilaterally and the parenchyma is hyperechoic with several cysts.  No
     hydronephrosis is visualized.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Complex fluid collection in the pelvis.  This might represent
     an abscess from an infected peritoneal dialysis catheter or represent a
     collection related to the adjacent sigmoid (which contains pneumatosis on CT
     examination) such as an abscess from sigmoid perforation. An ovarian mass
     appears less likely.
     
     2)  S/P subtotal hysterectomy and unilateral oophorectomy.  The remaining
     ovary is not visualized.

     ultrasound guidance, a micropuncture needle was inserted into the right
     basilic vein. The basilic vein was widely patent on ultrasound. A 0.018 wire
     was then inserted through the needle and the needle was exchanged for a peel-
     away 4 Fr sheath. A 0.018 wire was then extended into the SVC under
     flouroscopic guidance, over which a 4 Fr Vaxcel single lumen peripherally
     inserted central catheter (PICC), cut to 35 cm, was advanced. A post placement
     radiograph demonstrated the catheter tip in the distal SVC. The PICC was
     secured in place with a Statlock device and Tegaderm.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  54 YEAR OLD WOMAN WITH END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE ON HEMODIALYSIS
     WITH ABDOMINAL ABSCESS REQUIRING LONG TERM ANTIBIOTICS.
     
     RADIOLOGSTS:  [**Doctor First Name 132**] [**Doctor Last Name 107**] d'[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 14939**] [**Doctor Last Name 438**], and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 456**]. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 107**]
     [**Name (STitle) 108**], the attending radiologist, was present throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  After the risks and benefits of the procedure were
     explained to the patient, informed written consent was obtained. The patient
     was placed supine on the table, and the right arm was prepped and draped using
     standard sterile technique. No superficial veins clinically accessible. Under
     ultrasound guidance, a micropuncture needle was inserted into the right
     basilic vein. The basilic vein was widely patent on ultrasound. A 0.018 wire
     was then inserted through the needle and the needle was exchanged for a peel-
     away 4 Fr sheath. A 0.018 wire was then extended into the SVC under
     flouroscopic guidance, over which a 4 Fr Vaxcel single lumen peripherally
     inserted central catheter (PICC), cut to 35 cm, was advanced. A post placement
     radiograph demonstrated the catheter tip in the distal SVC. The PICC was
     secured in place with a Statlock device and Tegaderm.
     
     MEDICATIONS/ANESTHESIA:  Local (Lidocaine 1%).
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     FINDINGS:  Ultrasound reveals a widely patent basilic vein. Post placement
     radiograph confirms the presence of the PICC tip in the distal SVC.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 4-French Vaxcel single lumen PICC, cut
     to 35 cm and with tip in the distal SVC. The PICC is ready for use.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      54 year old woman with ESRD, abdominal pain, leukocytosis, and pelvic mass by
      CT. s/p drainage of 500 cc of brown fluid, containing 3+ wbc's, culture
      negative.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Follow-up of drainage of pelvic abscess. Look for communication with bowel.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Pelvis abscess, ? etiology.  Sinogram and tube study to assess for
     bowel communication.
     
     TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  Using sterile technique, injection of approximately 30 cc
     of Conray 30 was performed via this patient's previously placed pigtail
     catheter in a pelvic fluid collection.  This demonstrated a well delineated,
     isolated cavity.  There was no evidence of communication with bowel.  The
     majority of the contrast was freely removed after imaging.
     
     Under sterile technique, the patient's dialysis catheter was also injected
     with Conray 30.  This demonstrated free spillage into the abdomen with
     contrast interdigitating amongst loops of bowel, as would be expected.  There
     was no evidence of bowel opacification to suggest bowel communication.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent back to her room in
     unchanged condition.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Injection of both previously placed 8 FR pigtail catheter in the
     pelvis and the patient's dialysis catheter, performed separately.  No evidence
     of bowel communication involving either catheter.  Peritoneal catheter appears
     in good position with free spillage of contrast within the abdomen.

     INDICATION:  Low grade fever and abdominal tenderness.  Patient status post
     drainage of a pelvic fluid collection and removal of the peritoneal dialysis
     catheter.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast and post contrast helical scanning of the abdomen and
     pelvis was performed.  150 cc of Optiray was used because of the fast bolus
     injection.  Coronal reconstructions were made.
     
     ABDOMEN CT WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is diffuse atherosclerosis of the
     arterial vessels in the abdomen and pelvis.  The visualized lung bases are
     clear.  There are no destructive osseous lesions.
     
     The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen and adrenals are normal.  There is
     diffuse calcification in the intrarenal arteries and the kidneys are mildly
     atrophic.  There is no wall thickening, pneumatosis, or dilatation of the
     small bowel loops. There is no change in appearance of the short segment of
     sigmoid colon which contains multiple air bubbles along its wall when compared
     with [**2585-12-24**]. There is a small amount of stranding in the adjacent mesenteric
     fat. The remainder of the colon is unremarkable.
     
     PELVIS CT WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The amount of ascites has decreased
     since [**2585-12-24**].  The large pelvic fluid collection has resolved.  There is now
     a pigtail catheter in place with only a residual amount of fluid left in the
     pelvis.  The uterus and bladder are unremarkable.  There is no retroperitoneal
     or mesenteric adenopathy.
     
     CT ANGIOGRAM:  The abdominal aorta, celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery,
     renal arteries, inferior mesenteric artery, and iliac arteries are patent
     without filling defects.  Smaller order jejunal branches are also patent.
     There is no bowel obstruction. The left colic branches, including superior
     left colic, inferior left colic, sigmoid and rectosigmoid artreies are patent

     IMPRESSION:  There is no change of the short segment of sigmoid colon which
     has air bubbles along its wall.  It is unusual for pneumatosis to present in a
     short segment of sigmoid colon. Other possibilities to consider would be
     direct injury from insertion of the peritoneal catheter or a small
     diverticular abscess.  There is no other evidence of bowel ischemia.
       The amount of ascites has decreased since [**2585-12-24**]. The pelvic fluid
     collection has resolved with a drainage catheter in its location. The
     abdominal aorta and its major branches are patent.

     abscess. The patient requires antibiotics and TPN.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 132**] [**Name (STitle) 107**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **]'[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 456**], and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 127**]

     critical portion of the procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:  None.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: The previously placed basilic PICC line was
     visualized under fluoroscopy, with the tip at the distal portion of the
     superior vena cava (SVC). The line was reportedly trimmed to 35 cm at
     placement, and therefore was retracted approximately 20 cm. At this time, the
     line was cut near the skin entry site, and a 0.018 wire was advanced through
     the remaining line without difficulty such that the distal tip of the wire
     projected over the distal portion of the SVC. A 5-French peel-away sheath was
     then advanced over the wire. The wire was removed, and a 5-French, double-
     lumen Angiodynamics catheter was trimmed to 35 cm, advanced through the peel-
     away sheath and into the distal SVC. The sheath was subsequently peeled away.
     An imaged obtained following placement documented the distal tip of the line
     to project over the mid SVC. A left internal jugular dual-lumen central
     catheter was also present. The line was then secured to the patient's skin
     using a Stat-Lock device, dressing and OpSite.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: None.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful exchange of a 4-French single-lumen right basilic PICC
     to a 5-French double-lumen right basilic PICC, with the tip in the mid/distal
     superior vena cava. No complications. The line is ready for immediate use.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  54 year old female with end stage renal disease.  A left internal
     jugular tunnelled hemodialysis catheter was recently placed by the surgical
     team.  The catheter is functioning poorly and was unresponsive to TPA
     infusion.  Please assess for caking, fibrin sheath, etc, and replace or insert
     new catheter as necessary.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14946**], [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 127**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 106**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
     staff radiologist, was present during the procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:  30 ml of Optiray 320 at 60%; 1.75 mg of Versed and 100
     micrograms of Fentanyl in divided doses under continued hemodynamic
     monitoring for conscious sedation.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE:  The procedure was described to the patient and informed
     consent was obtained.  Aspiration from the arterial port was not possible.
     Aspiration from the venous port was possible but was somewhat difficult.  A
     superior vena cavagram was performed (Line study) through the venous port and
     demonstrated some degree of inhomogeneous contrast filling in the SVC around
     the catheter tip, consistent with some blood clots and/or fibrin sheath.
     Moreover, fluoroscopic examination of the left internal jugular catheter entry
     site demonstrates unfavorable curved angle of the tunnelled portion, which is
     probably somewhat kinked and is therefore responsible for the suboptimal
     flows.  Also noted is the arterial port which does not project in a medial
     superior vena caval position.
     
     With an INR of 1.4 as well as a left neck hematoma and a moderate degree of
     tenderness, the decision was made not to remove the left tunnelled catheter at
     this time and place a new right-sided internal jugular tunnelled dialysis
     catheter.  Sonographic interrogation of the right internal jugular vein
     demonstrates it to be widely patent and compressible.  Access was gained into
     the right internal jugular vein using a 21 g. single-wall needle and an 0.018
     wire.  The needle was then exchanged for a 4.5 French dilator/sheath, and the
     dilator and wire were then removed and replaced with an 0.035 Bentson
     guidewire.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, several attempts were made to pass
     the wire into the inferior vena cava but were unsuccessful.  The wire was then
                                                                 (Over)

     exchanged for an 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 133**] wire and an inferior vena caval placement of the
     wire could not performed.  The wire was therefore placed in the right atrium,
     and the tract was dilated to 10 French.  A measurement was then obtained, and
     a subcutaneous tunnel was formed using a blunt tip [**Last Name (un) 14947**] needle with 1%
     Lidocaine for local anesthesia.  The tract was dilated to 15 French, and a 15
     French peel-away sheath was then advanced over a wire.  A 14.5 French high
     flow Angiodynamics noncurved tunneled hemodialysis catheter (23 cm from cuff
     to tip) was then advanced over a wire through the peel-away sheath.  Attention
     was then redirected toward the right internal jugular entry site, and the
     tract was dilated to 14 French.  A 14 French peel-away sheath was then placed
     over the [**Doctor Last Name 133**] wire.  The 14 French dilator and wire were subsequently
     removed, double lumen catheter was advanced through the sheath which was
     simultaneously peeled away.  A radiograph obtained following placement
     demonstrates the arterial port to be a the cavoatrial junction, with the
     distal port in the proximal right atrium.  The catheter was then secured to
     the patient's skin using 2-0 silk sutures as well as O proline suture
     material.  Both ports aspirate and flush without difficulty, and the catheter
     is ready for immediate use.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Line study of the previously placed left internal jugular tunnelled catheter
     demonstrates unfavorable angle of the catheter at the left internal jugular
     entry site. Suspect some blood clots and/or fibrin sheath around the tip of
     the preexisiting dialysis catheter.
     
     A new right internal jugular 14.5 French Angiodynamics tunneled hemodialysis
     catheter was created, with the venous port projecting over the proximal right
     atrium.  The catheter is ready for immediate use.  No complications.
     
     The preexisting catheter was not removed due to relatively high INR and neck
     hematoma near the entry site of the preexisting catheter.

     superior vena cavagram was performed (Line study) through the venous port and
     demonstrated some degree of inhomogeneous contrast filling in the SVC around
     the catheter tip, consistent with some blood clots and/or fibrin sheath.
     Moreover, fluoroscopic examination of the left internal jugular catheter entry
     site demonstrates unfavorable curved angle of the tunnelled portion, which is
     probably somewhat kinked and is therefore responsible for the suboptimal
     flows.  Also noted is the arterial port which does not project in a medial
     superior vena caval position.
     
     With an INR of 1.4 as well as a left neck hematoma and a moderate degree of
     tenderness, the decision was made not to remove the left tunnelled catheter at
     this time and place a new right-sided internal jugular tunnelled dialysis
     catheter.  Sonographic interrogation of the right internal jugular vein
     demonstrates it to be widely patent and compressible.  Access was gained into
     the right internal jugular vein using a 21 g. single-wall needle and an 0.018
     wire.  The needle was then exchanged for a 4.5 French dilator/sheath, and the
     dilator and wire were then removed and replaced with an 0.035 Bentson
     guidewire.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, several attempts were made to pass
     the wire into the inferior vena cava but were unsuccessful.  The wire was then

     wire could not performed.  The wire was therefore placed in the right atrium,
     and the tract was dilated to 10 French.  A measurement was then obtained, and
     a subcutaneous tunnel was formed using a blunt tip [**Last Name (un) 14947**] needle with 1%
     Lidocaine for local anesthesia.  The tract was dilated to 15 French, and a 15
     French peel-away sheath was then advanced over a wire.  A 14.5 French high
     flow Angiodynamics noncurved tunneled hemodialysis catheter (23 cm from cuff
     to tip) was then advanced over a wire through the peel-away sheath.  Attention
     was then redirected toward the right internal jugular entry site, and the
     tract was dilated to 14 French.  A 14 French peel-away sheath was then placed
     over the [**Doctor Last Name 133**] wire.  The 14 French dilator and wire were subsequently
     removed, double lumen catheter was advanced through the sheath which was
     simultaneously peeled away.  A radiograph obtained following placement
     demonstrates the arterial port to be a the cavoatrial junction, with the
     distal port in the proximal right atrium.  The catheter was then secured to
     the patient's skin using 2-0 silk sutures as well as O proline suture
     material.  Both ports aspirate and flush without difficulty, and the catheter
     is ready for immediate use.

     the preexisiting dialysis catheter.
     
     A new right internal jugular 14.5 French Angiodynamics tunneled hemodialysis
     catheter was created, with the venous port projecting over the proximal right
     atrium.  The catheter is ready for immediate use.  No complications.
     
     The preexisting catheter was not removed due to relatively high INR and neck
     hematoma near the entry site of the preexisting catheter.

     catheter was created, with the venous port projecting over the proximal right
     atrium.  The catheter is ready for immediate use.  No complications.
     
     The preexisting catheter was not removed due to relatively high INR and neck
     hematoma near the entry site of the preexisting catheter.

     INDICATION:  Pelvic fluid collection with persistent fevers.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous helical images were obtained from the lung bases
     through the pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of intravenous
     Optiray.  Optiray was used per the general debilitated condition of the
     patient.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2586-1-4**].
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is left basilar consolidation.  There are
     small bilateral pleural effusions, as well.  The liver, gallbladder, pancreas,
     and adrenals are normal.  Two new areas of peripheral low density in the
     spleen likely indicate splenic infarcts.  Again, the kidneys are mildly
     atrophic, unchanged.  There is a small amount of ascites anterior to the
     liver.  The peritoneal dialysis catheter has been removed.  Small quantity of
     air courses along the tract where the catheter was positioned.  The stomach
     and proximal bowel are unremarkable and unchanged.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The mid-pelvic drainage catheter has been
     removed.  There is a small amount of residual fluid but much decreased in size
     in the interval.  Again noted is the short segment of abnormal appearing
     sigmoid colon, not significantly changed.  There is no free air.  Extensive
     vascular calcifications are noted.  Subcutaneous inflammatory change on the
     right abdomen and flank is again seen.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Fifty-four year old female with hypoxia, hypotension and depressed  
     right ventricular function; r/o PE.
      
     Ventilation images obtained with Tc-99m aerosol in 8 views demonstrate
     relatively lower activity in the left lung, most prominently in the left lower
     lobe.
      
     Perfusion images in the same 8 views show mild irregularity in the right lung
     base which matches the appearance of the right base on the ventilation images. 
     A linear area of decreased activity is noted in the posterior basal region of
     the left lower lobe with a larger defect in the same location on the ventilation
     scan.  No mismatched segmental or subsegmental perfusion defects are noted.
      
     The chest x-ray from [**2586-1-17**] reported a left lower lobe atelectasis/collapse and
     increased pulmonary vascularity which had shown interval improvement compared
     to the prior chest x-rays. 
      
     The above findings are consistent with a low likelihood of pulmonary embolism.
      
     IMPRESSION:  Low likelihood of pulmonary embolism. /nkg

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:
     Feeding tube placement.
     
     A feeding tube has been placed, and terminates below the diaphragm, with
     distal tip likely within the distal stomach. A right internal jugular central
     venous catheter remains in place, terminating in the right atrium. Cardiac and
     mediastinal contours are stable in the interval. There are minor atelectatic
     changes at the left base and there is probably a small left pleural effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Feeding tube terminates in the region of distal stomach.

     CHEST, [**1-23**]:
     
     INDICATION:  Diabetic on dialysis.  Hypotension and fever.  Dobbhoff
     nasogastric tube placed.  Evaluate position.
     
     FINDINGS:  A single AP supine image is provided.  The comparison study is
     dated [**2586-1-20**].  The heart again shows marked left ventricular enlargement.
     The aorta is slightly unfolded.  The pulmonary vessels are unremarkable and do
     not indicate cardiac failure at this time.  There is evidence of some patchy
     ill-defined pulmonary infiltrate/atelectasis in the basal segments of the left
     lower lobe seen through the cardiac silhouette.  Otherwise the lungs are
     clear.  No pleural effusions are identified.  The Dobbhoff NG tube tip is well
     positioned in the lower stomach but is not demonstrated on the present image.
     No other lines are detected.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory placement of Dobbhoff tube but distal end not
     demonstrated.

     CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST, [**2586-1-25**]
     
     HISTORY: End-stage renal disease, on dialysis with Candidemia and abdominal
     tenderness.  Assess for abdominal infectious/ischemic process. Evaluate
     splenic lesions seen on prior CT.  Administer IV and PO contrast.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helically aquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases to pubic symphysis after the administration of IV and oral
     contrast.  IV contrast was administered secondary to the request of the
     ordering physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 31**]. [**First Name (STitle) 7074**].  Nonionic IV contrast was administered
     secondary to the patient's debilitated state and renal disease.
     
     COMPARISONS: CT abdomen and pelvis of [**2585-1-13**], [**2586-1-4**] and [**2585-12-22**].
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The lung bases demonstrate an interval increase
     in the small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.  There is
     also a sub-cm  nodular density at the left lung base, new from previous recent
     exams, of unknown significance.  The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal
     glands, spleen and visualized abdominal vessels are unchanged since the
     previous exams.  The previously described probable splenic infracts are
     unchanged in size/appearance since the previous exam.  There has been an
     interval increase in the small amount of abdominal ascites.  There is focal
     wall thickening of segments of ascending colon and transverse colon, not
     appreciated on the most recent exam (secondary to lack of oral contrast in the
     lumen), but seen on the exam of [**2585-12-24**] within the opacified ascending colon.
     There is also wall thickening, without dilatation, of a short segment of
     terminal ileum. There is no lymphadenopathy within the abdomen.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There has been no interval change in the amount of
     fluid within the mid pelvis.  The visualized descending and sigmoid colons are
     unchanged in appearance.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  Again noted are
     diffuse vascualr calcifications.
     
     The osseous structures are unchanged in appearance.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Interval increase in small bilateral pleural effusions and abdominal

     INDICATION:  55 y/o woman with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, has
     perm cath infection, needs new perm catheter and also PICC line for
     antibiotics.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Attending Radiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 132**] [**Name (STitle) 107**] d'[**Name (STitle) **],
     Interventional Radiology Fellow Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2225**] [**Name (STitle) **].
     
     TECHNIQUE: Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 132**]
     [**Name (STitle) 107**] d'[**Name (STitle) **] was present for the entire procedure.
     
     The patient was brought to the angiography suite with the left arm and left
     neck sterilely prepped and draped. Ultrasound guidance was used to assess the
     left internal jugular vein. After local anesthesia with 1% Lidocaine, a 21-
     gauge needle was used to access the left internal jugular vein. The distal
     wire could not be passed easily under fluoroscopic observation, contrast was
     injected under fluoroscopy. This demonstrated patency of the jugular and
     brachiocephalic vein. With further manipulation under fluoroscopic guidance
     the 0.018 guide wire was advanced into the SVC. The needle was removed and a 4
     French sheath and dilator system placed. The wire was used to measure the
     dialysis catheter to the appropriate length. A chest exit site was measured,
     and the tract anesthesized with lidocaine 1%. An 18 gauge [**Last Name (un) 14947**] needle was

     needle was advanced into the basilic vein. Under fluoroscopic guidance a 0.018
     guide wire was advanced into the SVC. Appropriate length of the PICC line was
     measured, and the needle exchanged for a 5 French sheath and dilator system.
     The dual lumen PICC line was placed through the peelaway sheath under
     fluoroscopic observation to position in the SVC. A Stat-Lock and sterile
     dressing were applied. Post procedure radiograph was obtained.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: No immediate complications were evident.
     
     ANESTHESIA: Lidocaine 1% for local anesthesia. Under continuous hemodynamic
     monitoring a single dose of Fentanyl 25 mcg was administered intravenously. A
     total of 5 cc of ionic contrast was administered.
     
     FINDINGS: Sonography of the left upper neck demonstrated the internal jugular
     vein to be patent. Sonography of the left upper extremity demonstrated a
     patent, normally compressible left basilic vein. Post procedure radiographs
     demonstrated the tip of the left IJ dialysis catheter to be in the SVC, as
     well as the left PICC line to have its tip in the SVC.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Successful placement of 14.5 French 32 cm-long dual lumen dialysis catheter
     via the left internal jugular vein into the SVC.
     2. Successful placement of a 5 French 48 cm-long dual lumen PICC line via the
     left basilic vein into the lower portion of the SVC.

     The patient was brought to the angiography suite with the left arm and left
     neck sterilely prepped and draped. Ultrasound guidance was used to assess the
     left internal jugular vein. After local anesthesia with 1% Lidocaine, a 21-
     gauge needle was used to access the left internal jugular vein. The distal
     wire could not be passed easily under fluoroscopic observation, contrast was
     injected under fluoroscopy. This demonstrated patency of the jugular and
     brachiocephalic vein. With further manipulation under fluoroscopic guidance
     the 0.018 guide wire was advanced into the SVC. The needle was removed and a 4
     French sheath and dilator system placed. The wire was used to measure the
     dialysis catheter to the appropriate length. A chest exit site was measured,
     and the tract anesthesized with lidocaine 1%. An 18 gauge [**Last Name (un) 14947**] needle was

     needle was advanced into the basilic vein. Under fluoroscopic guidance a 0.018
     guide wire was advanced into the SVC. Appropriate length of the PICC line was
     measured, and the needle exchanged for a 5 French sheath and dilator system.
     The dual lumen PICC line was placed through the peelaway sheath under
     fluoroscopic observation to position in the SVC. A Stat-Lock and sterile
     dressing were applied. Post procedure radiograph was obtained.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: No immediate complications were evident.
     
     ANESTHESIA: Lidocaine 1% for local anesthesia. Under continuous hemodynamic
     monitoring a single dose of Fentanyl 25 mcg was administered intravenously. A
     total of 5 cc of ionic contrast was administered.
     
     FINDINGS: Sonography of the left upper neck demonstrated the internal jugular
     vein to be patent. Sonography of the left upper extremity demonstrated a
     patent, normally compressible left basilic vein. Post procedure radiographs
     demonstrated the tip of the left IJ dialysis catheter to be in the SVC, as
     well as the left PICC line to have its tip in the SVC.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Successful placement of 14.5 French 32 cm-long dual lumen dialysis catheter
     via the left internal jugular vein into the SVC.
     2. Successful placement of a 5 French 48 cm-long dual lumen PICC line via the
     left basilic vein into the lower portion of the SVC.

     INDICATION:  55 y/o woman with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, has
     perm cath infection, needs new perm catheter and also PICC line for
     antibiotics.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Attending Radiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 132**] [**Name (STitle) 107**] d'[**Name (STitle) **],

     [**Name (STitle) 107**] d'[**Name (STitle) **] was present for the entire procedure.
     
     The patient was brought to the angiography suite with the left arm and left
     neck sterilely prepped and draped. Ultrasound guidance was used to assess the
     left internal jugular vein. After local anesthesia with 1% Lidocaine, a 21-
     gauge needle was used to access the left internal jugular vein. The distal
     wire could not be passed easily under fluoroscopic observation, contrast was
     injected under fluoroscopy. This demonstrated patency of the jugular and
     brachiocephalic vein. With further manipulation under fluoroscopic guidance
     the 0.018 guide wire was advanced into the SVC. The needle was removed and a 4
     French sheath and dilator system placed. The wire was used to measure the
     dialysis catheter to the appropriate length. A chest exit site was measured,
     and the tract anesthesized with lidocaine 1%. An 18 gauge [**Last Name (un) 14947**] needle was
     used to form the tract, which was serially dilated, and the catheter was
     placed through the tract. The venipuncture site was serially dilated and a
     14.5 French peelaway sheath placed. The catheter was placed through the
     peelaway sheath which was then removed. Fluoroscopic observation at this point
     demonstrated the catheter to be in the SVC. Sterile dressings were applied and
     the catheter was sutured in place with O-prolene.

     heart is enlarged. There is mild vascular congestion without interstitial or
     alveolar edema.  There is atelectasis at the left base. I doubt the presence
     of underlying consolidation.  There no are large pleural effusions.

     Reason: SECONDARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM. 
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Secondary hyperparathyroidism.
      
     INTERPRETATION:  Following the intravenous injection of tracer, images of the 
     neck including anterior, pinhole and marker views were obtained at 20 minutes
     and 2 hours. 
      
     The initial images show homogeneous uptake in the thyroid gland.  There is
     uptake in both lungs, which may be due to CHF.  
      
     Delayed images show persistent activity within the thyroid gland region which
     is nonspecific and of uncertain significance, but could represent parathyroid
     hyperplasia.
      
     Planar view of the chest shows no obvious focus of mediastinal activity.
      
     This examination was limited due to patient inability to remain immobile. 
     Furthermore, there was bone marrow and lung uptake, limiting the sensitivity of
     this study.
      
     IMPRESSION:  Technically limited study due to patient inability to tolerate
     positioning, as well as bone marrow and lung uptake.  Persistent activity
     within the thyroid gland region of uncertain significance but could represent
     parathyroid hyperplasia.  No obvious mediastinal activity. /nkg

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     REASON: Patient is s/p fem-tib bypass graft with ___jump graft.  Evaluate for
     potential stenosis, progression of distal disease.
     
     Duplex evaluation was performed of the right lower extremity arterial system
     with concentration on what appears to be a proximal [**Doctor Last Name 14969**]-Tex graft from the
     femoral artery with a vein graft to the posterior tibial artery.
     
     The peak systolic velocities are as follows:  78, 275, 55, 47 in the native
     proximal vessel, proximal anastomosis, distal anastomosis, and native distal
     vessel respectively.  Throughout the body of the proximal graft velocities
     range from 28 through 53.  Throughout teh jump graft velocities range from 35
     through 55.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Patent bypass graft.  However, there is greater than 50% stenosis
     at the proximal anastomosis.  In addition, there are significantly low flow
     velocities at several segments in the proximal graft and throughout the
     majority of the tibial graft.  Although this is often seen in distal bypass
     grafts, it is concerning since the velocities are distal to a proximal
     stenosis. Clinical correlation is warranted.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Fifty-five year old female for CAD evaluation.
      
     INTERPRETATION:  Dobutamine was infused intravenously in 3 stages with total  
     infusion over approximately 8 minutes.  The initial stage was 15 ug/kg/min,
     increasing to a final stage of 45 ug/kg/min.  At peak infusion, MIBI was
     administered IV.  The patient had a choking feeling with the infusion, but no
     ischemic EKG changes.
      
     Imaging Protocol:  gated SPECT.
      
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium.
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the rest images.
      
     The images show left ventricular enlargement.  There are multiple fixed severe
     defects.  There are severe defects at the apex, distal anterior wall, distal
     inferior wall, inferior portion of lateral wall, and apical portion of septal
     wall.  The perfusion defects are worsened from the Persantine MIBI study of
     [**2585-11-17**].
      
     Ejection fraction calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after
     Dobutamine administration shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of
     approximately 28%.  This is decreased from 47% on [**2585-11-17**].  There is severe
     global hypokinesis.
      
     IMPRESSION:  Left ventricular enlargement.  Multiple severe fixed defects
     involving apex, distal portions of anterior and inferior walls, apical portion
     of septal wall, and inferior portion of lateral wall.  EF 28% with severe global
     hypokinesis. /nkg

     CHEST, [**2-13**]:
     
     INDICATION:  Calciphylaxis and hypoxia.  S/P parathyroidectomy.  Low sats.
     Intubated.  Check for pneumonia, CHF, effusions.
     
     FINDINGS:  A single AP supine chest image is provided.  Comparison study is
     dated [**2586-2-4**].  The heart shows fairly marked left ventricular enlargement.
     Slight LV failure cannot be excluded.  However, no significant pulmonary
     infiltrates are seen.  Some minor linear atelectasis is present at the left
     base.  An ETT is noted, in good position.  An NGT is present with its tip in
     the mid stomach.  A left IJ central line is present with its tip in the upper
     right atrium.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  LV enlargement with minimal if any failure.  Lines in
     satisfactory position as noted.  In addition a left subclavian central line is
     also noted with its tip in the mid SVC.
