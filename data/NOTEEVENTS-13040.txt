     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      50 year old woman with large liver abscess s/p whipple ('[**01**]) and multiple 
      abscesses.  
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

     STUDY:  CT-guided abscess drainage.
     
     INDICATION:  50-year-old woman with large liver abscess.  History of
     pancreatic cancer, Whipple, and multiple abscesses.
     
     PRELIMINARY CT SCANNING EXAMINATION:  Outside CT dated [**3205-9-6**] was reviewed
     revealing a 7 x 5 cm round abscess with an air fluid level in the right
     hepatic lobe. Preliminary CT at [**Hospital1 416**] again revealed a 7 x 5 cm collection
     with an air fluid level in a bilobed configuration, with a contiguous smaller
     component slightly more inferiorly.
     
     There are small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis, right
     greater than left.
     
     CATHETER INSERTION:  Utilizing CT guidance, and a tandem trocar technique, a
     10 French locking pigtail catheter was inserted and deployed into the abscess.
     Catheter position was confirmed using CT scanning.  Catheter was locked in
     position, secured to the skin with a percutaneous catheter fastener, and left
     to open drainage. Purulent fluid flowed freely into the drainage bag.
     
     Sample was sent to the laboratory for Gram stain, culture and sensitivity.
     .
     CONSCIOUS SEDATION:  The patient received Versed and fentanyl IV and was
     continuously monitored in the Radiology holding area.
     
     No immediate complications occurred.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful CT-guided catheter placement and drainage of right
     hepatic abscess.
     The attending. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 11180**] was present, scrubbed and assisted throughout

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  History of pancreatic cancer status post Whipple complaining of
     not feeling well and shortness of breath.  Pleuritic chest pain.  Evaluate for
     PE.
     
     There is a prior abdominal scan entered into PACs dated [**3205-9-6**], from an
     outside institution.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the chest were obtained before and
     after the administration of 100 cc of Optiray contrast IV.  Delayed images
     through the abdomen and pelvis were obtained.  Multiplanar reformatted images
     of both the chest and abdomen and pelvis were obtained.
     
     CTA OF THE CHEST:  There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism or thoracic
     aortic dissection.  There is a right-sided approach central venous catheter in
     place, with the tip in the superior vena cava.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  There is no pleural or pericardial
     effusion.  The heart and great vessels are normal.  There is a large
     left hilar lesion just superior to the left pulmonary artery, measuring 3.4 x
     3.9 cm, which may represent a large metastatic lymph node.  There are severe
     emphysematous changes of the lungs.  There are scattered areas of patchy
     atelectasis and ground glass opacity, but no definite focal consolidation is
     visualized.  No pulmonary nodule is visualized.  The central airways are
     patent.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  Evaluation of the abdomen and pelvis is limited
     in this patient with a paucity of abdominal fat. The cavitating lesion within
     the right lobe of the liver has decreased in size compared to [**9-6**].  A
     drainage catheter is in place within this collection.  There is another ill-
     defined hypodensity within the right lobe of the liver anteriorly, which is
     concerning for a metastatic lesion.  Another ill-defined hypodensity is seen
     within the right lobe of the liver inferiorly (series 4b, image 163).  There
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     are two ill- defined splenic hypodensities, which are not fully characterized
     on this study.  The patient is status post Whipple.  The nodule of the left
     adrenal gland previously described is less apparent on today's study, though a
     nodule is still present. The right adrenal gland is unremarkable.  The kidneys
     enhance symmetrically and excrete normally. Atrophy of the upper pole of the
     right kidney is not significantly changed from prior exam.  There is no free
     air in the abdomen. The stomach, small and large bowel loops are normal. The
     bowel is not optimally assessed given the small amount of oral contrast
     present.  There is a moderate amount of stool within the colon, suggesting
     constipation.  The aorta is of normal caliber. Soft tissue is seen
     surrounding the SMA, as on prior exams. It is difficult to comment on the
     presence or absence of mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes given the
     paucity of intra- abdominal fat.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Pelvic bowel loops are unremarkable.  There is a
     Foley catheter within the bladder.  There may be a small amount of free fluid
     in the pelvis between bowel loops.  It is difficult to comment on the presence
     or absence of lymph nodes on the study.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions.  An
     epidural catheter device is seen.  The lower portion of this device within the
     right buttock is resulting in a fair amount of beam-hardening artifact,
     obscuring detail.
     
     Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the anatomy and
     pathology in this case.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic dissection.
     2.  Large left hilar mass, likely representing a metastatic lymph node.
     3.  There is a catheter present within the known right liver abscess cavity.
     There are two additional hypodensities within the liver parenchyma as
     described, which are too small to characterize but may represent metastatic
     disease or foci of infection.
     4.  There is no pneumobilia present on this exam, of undetermined
     significance.
     5.  New hypodensities within the spleen, of undetermined etiology. Metastatic
     disease is not excluded. These were not present on prior exams including the
     last CT exam of [**1-11**].  Scarring of the right kidney upper pole, unchanged.
     
     Please note that the abdominal and pelvic portion of the study is extremely
     difficult to interpret given the paucity of intra-abdominal fat and beam-
     hardening artifact present.

     not feeling well and shortness of breath.  Pleuritic chest pain.  Evaluate for
     PE.
     
     There is a prior abdominal scan entered into PACs dated [**3205-9-6**], from an
     outside institution.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the chest were obtained before and
     after the administration of 100 cc of Optiray contrast IV.  Delayed images
     through the abdomen and pelvis were obtained.  Multiplanar reformatted images
     of both the chest and abdomen and pelvis were obtained.
     
     CTA OF THE CHEST:  There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism or thoracic
     aortic dissection.  There is a right-sided approach central venous catheter in
     place, with the tip in the superior vena cava.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  There is no pleural or pericardial
     effusion.  The heart and great vessels are normal.  There is a large
     left hilar lesion just superior to the left pulmonary artery, measuring 3.4 x
     3.9 cm, which may represent a large metastatic lymph node.  There are severe
     emphysematous changes of the lungs.  There are scattered areas of patchy
     atelectasis and ground glass opacity, but no definite focal consolidation is
     visualized.  No pulmonary nodule is visualized.  The central airways are
     patent.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  Evaluation of the abdomen and pelvis is limited
     in this patient with a paucity of abdominal fat. The cavitating lesion within
     the right lobe of the liver has decreased in size compared to [**9-6**].  A
     drainage catheter is in place within this collection.  There is another ill-
     defined hypodensity within the right lobe of the liver anteriorly, which is
     concerning for a metastatic lesion.  Another ill-defined hypodensity is seen
     within the right lobe of the liver inferiorly (series 4b, image 163).  There
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     are two ill- defined splenic hypodensities, which are not fully characterized
     on this study.  The patient is status post Whipple.  The nodule of the left
     adrenal gland previously described is less apparent on today's study, though a
     nodule is still present. The right adrenal gland is unremarkable.  The kidneys
     enhance symmetrically and excrete normally. Atrophy of the upper pole of the
     right kidney is not significantly changed from prior exam.  There is no free
     air in the abdomen. The stomach, small and large bowel loops are normal. The
     bowel is not optimally assessed given the small amount of oral contrast
     present.  There is a moderate amount of stool within the colon, suggesting
     constipation.  The aorta is of normal caliber. Soft tissue is seen
     surrounding the SMA, as on prior exams. It is difficult to comment on the
     presence or absence of mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes given the
     paucity of intra- abdominal fat.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Pelvic bowel loops are unremarkable.  There is a
     Foley catheter within the bladder.  There may be a small amount of free fluid
     in the pelvis between bowel loops.  It is difficult to comment on the presence
     or absence of lymph nodes on the study.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions.  An
     epidural catheter device is seen.  The lower portion of this device within the
     right buttock is resulting in a fair amount of beam-hardening artifact,
     obscuring detail.
     
     Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the anatomy and
     pathology in this case.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic dissection.
     2.  Large left hilar mass, likely representing a metastatic lymph node.
     3.  There is a catheter present within the known right liver abscess cavity.
     There are two additional hypodensities within the liver parenchyma as
     described, which are too small to characterize but may represent metastatic
     disease or foci of infection.
     4.  There is no pneumobilia present on this exam, of undetermined
     significance.
     5.  New hypodensities within the spleen, of undetermined etiology. Metastatic
     disease is not excluded. These were not present on prior exams including the
     last CT exam of [**1-11**].  Scarring of the right kidney upper pole, unchanged.
     
     Please note that the abdominal and pelvic portion of the study is extremely
     difficult to interpret given the paucity of intra-abdominal fat and beam-
     hardening artifact present.

Pertinent Results:
[**3205-9-28**] CT torso:  IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic 
dissection.
2. Large left hilar mass, likely representing a metastatic lymph 
node.
3. There is a catheter present within the known right liver 
abscess cavity. There are two additional hypodensities within 
the liver parenchyma as described, which are too small to 
characterize but may represent metastatic disease or foci of 
infection.
4. There is no pneumobilia present on this exam, of undetermined 
significance.
5. New hypodensities within the spleen, of undetermined 
etiology. Metastatic disease is not excluded. These were not 
present on prior exams including the last CT exam of [**1-11**]. Scarring of the right kidney upper pole, unchanged.
.
[**3205-9-28**] CXR:  IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pneumonia.
2. Left hilar prominence, which is new when compared to the 
prior study of [**3204-10-5**]. Further investigation is 
warranted in this patient with a past medical history of 
pancreatic cancer.
.
[**3205-9-28**] EKG:  Sinus rhythm. Diffuse non-specific T wave 
abnormalities. Since the previous 
tracing of [**3204-7-28**] further precordial lead T wave changes are 
present. 
.
[**3205-9-29**] CT head:  IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage 
or mass effect. Contrast-enhanced MRI is more sensitive for the 
detection of metastatic lesions.
.
[**3205-9-29**] CXR:  SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW CHEST. Interval increase 
in pulmonary markings consistent with fluid overload. Small 
bilateral pleural effusions are stable. The lungs are 
hyperinflated consistent with patient's known emphysema. Cardiac 
size is normal. Left hilar mass is unchanged. Right PICC line 
with tip in the SVC. Drainage catheter in the right upper 
quadrant abdomen unchanged in position.

IMPRESSION: Fluid overload.

[**10-2**] Bronchoscopy with FNA: negative for malignant cells, 
scattered bronchial cells and lymphocytes.

[**10-4**] CXR: Increased interstitial markings compared to the prior 
study, consistent with pulmonary edema superimposed upon chronic 
interstitial changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 W s/p Whipple procedure for pancreatic cancer, with drain for 
hepatic abscess in place who presents with 4 days of dyspnea, 
cough, found to be febrile in the ED, with new findings on CT 
concerning for mets.  
.  
#SOB: The patient originally presented with SOB to OSH. CXR 
showed a hilar mass which was also seen on CT which was 
questionable for metastatic lymph node vs. infectious cause. 
Bronchoscopy was done which was negative for malignant cells and 
had scattered lyphocytes and bronchial cells. The patient was 
also presumed to have a COPD flare. She was treated with duonebs 
and O2 prn and improved over the course of admission. She was 
also treated with levaquin for COPD flare vs. a questionable 
pneumonia and was afebrile 48 hours prior to admission.
.
#Liver abscess-patient was febrile on admission. Fluid from 
abscess was drained and cultured. It grew out enterococcus and 
[**Female First Name (un) 929**] albicans. ID was consulted and the patient was put back 
on zosyn for [**5-12**] week course. She also has a follow-up 
appointment with ID in 2 weeks as well as a repeat CT scan. 
Treatment of c. albicans was deferred.
.
#Pancreatic CA: Patient is four years out from her diagnosis, 
s/p whipple. 
.  
#HTN: stable. We continued HCTZ.  
.  
#Hypothyroid: TSH slightly  elevated, but free t4 was normal. 
Presumed to be sick euthyroid syndrome. We continued levoxyl at 
home dose.

     INDICATION:  50-year-old woman with COPD and hilar mass, with cough, and
     crackles.  Evaluate for fluid overload or pneumonia.
     
     COMPARISON:  Study from [**3205-9-29**].
     
     PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There is a right PICC, with the tip in the
     mid portion of the superior vena cava.  There is a catheter positioned over
     the right upper quadrant, corresponding to the drainage catheter positioned
     within the right lobe of the liver.  There is an intraspinous catheter again
     seen.
     
     Again seen are diffuse areas of increased interstitial markings, consistent
     with the patient's known history of chronic interstitial disease.  The
     interstitial markings have increased since the prior exam, which would be
     consistent with superimposed pulmonary edema. There is blunting of the
     costophrenic angles bilaterally, which may represent small effusions, or
     chronic thickening.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in
     appearance. No pneumothorax is seen.  The soft tissue and osseous structures
     are unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings compared to the prior study,
     consistent with pulmonary edema superimposed upon chronic interstitial
     changes.

     abscess with recent CT-guided drainage.  Currently leaking fluid about
     catheter with flushes.
     
     COMPARISON:  Torso CT from [**3205-9-28**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Volumetric CT imaging of the abdomen was performed without oral or
     IV contrast.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There are areas of ground glass and vague
     nodular opacities in both lower lobes with a suggestion of intralobular septal
     thickening which is nodular in some areas.  The amount of ground-glass opacity
     has improved since [**3205-9-28**].  There are no pleural or pericardial
     effusions.
     
     Drainage catheter in the right lobe of the liver is unchanged in position.  No
     definite peri-catheter fluid collection is present.  There is no overt biliary
     ductal dilatation.  Assessment of the solid abdominal organs is limited
     without IV contrast.  Allowing for limitations, the liver, pancreas, adrenal

                                     FINAL REPORT
     STUDY:  CTA of the chest.
     
     INDICATION:  51-year-old female with history of pancreatic cancer and
     prevascular mass.  Patient presenting with hypoxia.  Assess for pulmonary
     embolism.
     
     COMPARISONS:  CT torso dated [**3205-11-4**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Low-dose non-contrast MDCT axial images of the chest were
     acquired.  Following the administration of 80 cc of Optiray intravenous
     contrast, MDCT axial images were acquired from the thoracic inlet to the upper
     abdomen.  Coronal, sagittal, and reformatted images were then obtained.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are no filling defects
     present within the pulmonary arterial vasculature consistent with pulmonary
     embolism.  There has been dramatic interval increase in a large prevascular
     lymph node which on today's examination measures 7.9 x 6.2 cm (3:25).  This
     compares to a maximal dimension on the previous examination of 3.5 cm.  This
     prevascular mass is noted to surround and encase the left pulmonary artery
     with mild associated compression and soft tissue is also noted to extend along
     the left hilar structures.
     
     Within the left lung apex, there is a new lung nodule measuring 2.2 x 1.8 cm
     which is concerning for a new metastatic lesion (3:6). No other focal lesions
     are identified.  Overall the interstitial markings are prominent and there is
     diffuse centrilobular emphysema throughout both lungs which is slightly
     worsened compared to the previous examination. Furthermore, within the left
     upper lobe of the lung, there is increased interstitial markings and diffuse
     ground- glass opacity which is concerning for a superimposed pneumonia. A new,
     left-sided pleural effusion with associated mild compressive atelectasis is
     also noted. The heart and great vessels are unremarkable. There is no
     pericardial effusion. Limited views of the upper abdominal organs are
     unremarkable.
     
     OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified. An
     epidural catheter is again is noted in place and unchanged grossly in position
     compared to previous examination.
                                                                 (Over)

     HISTORY:  51-year-old woman with history of pancreatic carcinoma and now with
     two lung masses.  Please biopsy one of the left lung masses.
     
     CT BIOPSY LOCALIZATION:
     
     Limited axial CT images were obtained through the lungs to localize the lesion
     to be biopsied.  Correlation is made to the prior study dated [**3206-8-22**].
     
     Two major lesions were identified in the left lung.  There is a 2.4 cm mass in
     the anterior aspect of the left upper lobe as well as a larger, more central
     region abutting the vasculature.
     
     CT BIOPSY GUIDANCE:
     
     CT fluoroscopy was used for placement of an 18-gauge guiding needle into a
     smaller left upper lobe mass.  After satisfactory placement of the needle tube
     was confirmed using CT fluoroscopy, a one needle aspiration was performed
     followed by a single core biopsy.  Touch preparations of these samples were
     reviewed by a cytologist in the CT suite.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There was no evidence of
     pneumothorax on post-procedure CT fluoroscopy images.
     
     CONSCIOUS SEDATION:  The patient received a total of 2 mg of Versed and 100
     mcg of fentanyl and was continuously monitored in the radiology department by
     a registered nurse for the duration of the procedure.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful CT-guided biopsy of a 2.4 cm left upper lobe nodule.

     HISTORY:  Decreased breath sounds, left base.
     
     Compared to the prior study, the large left perihilar mass has increased in
     size.  Previously, it measured approximately 5.3 x 4.3 cm.  Today, it measures
     6.1 x 5.3 cm.  There has been an increase in the size of the left pleural
     effusion as well, best appreciated on the PA film.  Effusion appears
     relatively stable on the lateral film.  The right lung is unchanged without
     focal infiltrate.  There is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in the size of the left perihilar mass.  Size
     of the left pleural effusion has increased as well.
