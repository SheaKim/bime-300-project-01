Brief Hospital Course:
81 year old woman with h/o htn and rheumatoid arthritis (on 
chronic steroids) admitted with urosepsis and found to have 
stress-induced cardiomyopathy (s/p cath [**11-25**]). Found to have 
thrombocytopenia consistent with HIT and may have suffered a TIA 
 with negative head CT and MRI/MRA. Was placed on argatroban gtt 
and aggrenox and bridged to coumadin while HIT Ab test was 
pending. 
.
## Thrombocytopenia: Patient's platelet count was 122K on 
admission and dropped three days later to 62K. Differential 
diagnosis included sepsis, possible HIT I or II. SQ heparin and 
all flushes stopped. Concurrently, patient developed facial 
droop, ptosis, tongue deviation and right LE swelling concerning 
for arterial and venous thrombi. US of right LE negative for 
DVT. While HIT Ab was pending, patient was started on argatroban 
gtt. Hematology/oncology was consulted and recommended bridging 
patient to warfarin. First HIT Ab [**Doctor First Name **] test returned as 
negative. Argatroban ggt was discontinued after the INR was >3 
after a 3 hour trial off argatroban. Second HIT Ab [**Doctor First Name **] was 
negative suggesting no HIT Ab. Also, per heme/onc time course of 
thrombocytopenia was shorter than expected for development of 
HIT Ab (usually 5-6 days) however in the setting of a possible 
TIA, patient will continue warfarin with goal INR betw [**2-7**] until 
follow-up at hematology/oncology clinic.
.
## Neuro: Had new facial droop and tongue deviation on [**11-28**] 
thought be a TIA likely secondary to HIT Ab. Head CT was 
negative for bleed. Head MRI/MRA was negative for acute 
ischemia. Carotid doppler showed no significant stenosis. HBAIC 
6.0 and lipid panel within normal limits. Stroke team was 
consulted and recommended starting ASA. Patient was switched 
from salsalate to ASA without adverse drug rxn (hx of asa 
allergy), and then switched to aggrenox. Patient placed on baby 
ASA while on coumadin. Unclear whether facial signs were TIA or 
twitching so EEG was performed which was negative for 
epileptiform activity. Per stroke, continue ASA until outpatient 
follow-up. Recommended increasing ASA dose to 325mg once off 
warfarin.
.
## Cardiac: likely stress-induced cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo) 
versus secondary to sepsis.
# Ischemia: patient had PTCA [**11-25**] revealing an LAD 60% occlus, 
patent Lcx & RCA. Repeat echo [**11-26**] EF 25-30% severe LV 
hypokinesis and LV sys fcn depression, RV sys fcn depression, no 
endocarditis. TropI peaked at 25.3 at outside hospital, tropT 
1.80 on admission. Patient started on toprol XL 25mg QD, 
lisinopril 5mg PO QD and baby ASA. Nifedipine was held.
# Pump: Patient with low EF in setting of sepsis. Initially 
hypotensive on levophed and aggressively fluid resuscitated. 
Patient was on also hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone for 1 
week course and then resumed on her outpatient dose of 
prednisone 1mg PO BID. Patient was gradually weaned off 
pressors. Patient became  hypotensive again secondary to 
excessive diarrhea which improved with fluid boluses and 
resolution of her dairrhea. 
# Rhythm: Sinus with PVCs. Cont telemetry.
.
#. Fever/Leukocytosis: Likely [**2-6**] E coli UTI and +BC GNR, has 
been afebrile since admission, leukocytosis may also be 
secondary to steroids, newly diagnosed lymphoma. OSH cx ([**Location (un) **] 
ICU [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9750**])-> E. Coli pansensitive. Possible LLL pna on 
CXR however sat'ing well on room air and asymptomatic. Repeat 
U/A + for UTI & urine cxr no growth. C. diff negativex3. Patient 
to complete a 2 week course of levoquin until [**12-6**] 
urosepsis and possible LLL pneumonia. C. diff negativex3.
.
#. Acidosis: mixed venous pH 7.31, HCO3 15, AG adj for 
hypoalb=13 HCO3 16. Likely mixed picture, nongap and gap 
acidosis. Etiology likely secondary to septic shock, decreased 
PO intake and fluid resuscitation with NS. Her 1.5 days of 
diarrhea likely contributed to her nongap acidosis. HCO3 at 
discharge 22 with no anion gap.
.
# Aphthous ulcer: likely [**2-6**] HSV 1 and stress.  
- topical acyclovir to lip  
- magic mouthwash for tongue/throat
- pureed diet for now as pt's dentures don't fit  
- consider adding sulcrafate if not feeling better  
.  
# Diarrhea: likely [**2-6**] to abx v c diff v [**2-6**] too aggressive 
bowel regimen. Resolving. Changed to lactose free diet.  
- cont Imodium  
- Hold bowel regimen  
- C diff negative x3  
.
#. Rheumatoid arthritis: initally held methotrexate and 
prednisone. Should resume outpatient regimen.
.
#. FEN: repleting lytes, cardiac healthy diet as tolerated. 
Nutrition was consulted given history of decreased intake and 
low albumin, boost breezes with meals, zinc oxide, vitamin C for 
wound healing (sacral irritation) and calcium vit D 
supplementation for chronic steroid use.

      81 year old woman with fevers and cardiomyopathy.                               
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      ?infiltrate                                                                     
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Fever and cardiomyopathy, question infiltrate.
     
     CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW. No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison.
     
     Rotated positioning. There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  The aorta is
     calcified.  There is biapical pleural thickening, which extends along both
     right and left paratracheal regions.  No abnormal constriction of the trachea
     is identified. In addition, the aortic wall appears to be thickened on this
     examination. There is firbonodular scarring in both upper zones.
     
     There is a band of density through the right mid lung, which could represent
     atelectasis or fluid in the minor fissure, though an area of scarring or
     consolidation cannot be excluded.  This extends to the right hilum.  The right
     hemidiaphragm is elevated.
     
     There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe
     collapse and/or consolidation. Possible minimal blunting of the left
     costophrenic angle.
     
     A single surgical clip is noted in the right upper quadrant, possibly
     suggesting prior cholecystectomy.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Cardiomegaly. No overt CHF.
     
     2.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
     
     3.  Evidence for biapical pleural thickening and scarring raising the question
     of prior granulomatous disease.
     
     4.  Unusual density in the right mid zone extending to the right hilum, with
     elevated right hemidiaphragm, of uncertain clinical significance.  This could
     represent scarring, but possibility of a more acute process cannot be excluded
     on this single film. Attention to this area on follow-up filns is
     recommended. If clinically indcated, a lateral view may help for further
     assessment. 
     
     5.  Osteopenia and degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  Fevers and cardiomegaly.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3157-11-25**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Two unusual horizontal interfaces in the right mid lung are the
     product of worsened right middle lobe atelectasis sandwiched between displaced
     minor and major fissures.  Consolidation is developing in both lower lobes,
     accompanied by small volumes of pleural fluid. Apical pleural thickening, left
     greater than right, is stable. Old films would be helpful for comparison. The
     heart is top normal size. The mediastinum is widened by a tortuous, calcified
     thoracic aorta.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Probable developing bibasilar pneumonia and worsening right
     middle lobe atelectasis.  Consult more remote prior films to assess asymmetric
     apical pleural thickening.

     INDICATION:  81-year-old female with history of multiple GI bleeds, requiring
     multiple transfusions.  Please place single lumen PICC line for IV access.
     
     RADIOLOGIST:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1635**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 603**].  The attending radiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 602**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 603**],  was present throughout the procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The patient was brought to the angiography Suite, and
     placed supine on the angiography table.  Using ultrasound guidance, the left
     brachial vein was found to be patent and compressible.  The left arm was
     prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was
     administered with 1% lidocaine subcutaneously.  Using real time ultrasound
     guidance, 21-gauge needle was advanced into the left brachial vein.  A 0.018-
     inch guide wire was advanced through the needle into the superior vena cava
     under fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was exchanged for an introducer
     sheath, and a 4.5 French single lumen PICC was cut to length of 34 cm based on
     the markings on the wire.  The PICC was placed over the wire through the
     sheath.  The wire and sheath were removed.  The ports flushed and aspirated
     well, was capped and heplocked.  Pre- and post-PICC placement ultrasound
     images were obtained to document vessel patency.  The catheter was fixed to
     place using a StatLock device, and sterile transparent dressing was applied. A
     final limited chest radiograph confirmed catheter position in the mid SVC.
     There were no procedural or immediate postprocedural complications.  The
     catheter is ready for use.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  1% lidocaine for local anesthesia.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 4.5-French single-lumen 34-cm PICC by
     way of the left brachial vein, with the tip in the mid SVC.  The line is ready
     for use.

      81 year old woman with hx multiple GI bleeds, requiring frequent transfusions, 
      transferred for GI w/u
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      can [**Doctor First Name 1041**] place PICC?

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  81-year-old female with history of multiple GI bleeds, requiring
     multiple transfusions.  Please place single lumen PICC line for IV access.
     
     RADIOLOGIST:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1635**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 603**].  The attending radiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 602**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 603**],  was present throughout the procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The patient was brought to the angiography Suite, and
     placed supine on the angiography table.  Using ultrasound guidance, the left
     brachial vein was found to be patent and compressible.  The left arm was
     prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was
     administered with 1% lidocaine subcutaneously.  Using real time ultrasound
     guidance, 21-gauge needle was advanced into the left brachial vein.  A 0.018-
     inch guide wire was advanced through the needle into the superior vena cava
     under fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was exchanged for an introducer
     sheath, and a 4.5 French single lumen PICC was cut to length of 34 cm based on
     the markings on the wire.  The PICC was placed over the wire through the
     sheath.  The wire and sheath were removed.  The ports flushed and aspirated
     well, was capped and heplocked.  Pre- and post-PICC placement ultrasound
     images were obtained to document vessel patency.  The catheter was fixed to
     place using a StatLock device, and sterile transparent dressing was applied. A
     final limited chest radiograph confirmed catheter position in the mid SVC.
     There were no procedural or immediate postprocedural complications.  The
     catheter is ready for use.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  1% lidocaine for local anesthesia.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 4.5-French single-lumen 34-cm PICC by
     way of the left brachial vein, with the tip in the mid SVC.  The line is ready
     for use.
