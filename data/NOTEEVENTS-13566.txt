Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 992**] 
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxic respiratory insufficiency. 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
MICU monitoring
 
History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o, Russian-speaking only, male with a PMH of 
interstitial lung disease, Alzhemier's dementia, PUD, who 
presents from the NH with hypoxia. He was found to be in his 
room earlier today, appearing pale with O2 sats from 74-84 on 
2LNC. He is normally on O2 2-4L NC at the NH [**12-28**] to his ILD. He 
was brought into the ED for further evaluation.  
Per his grandchildren, the pt has not been well for the past 3 
days - not eating or drinking, looking pale and weaker than 
usual. He was recently started on Levaquin for PNA on [**2924-12-15**]. 
Family denies pt having a cough, fevers, chest pain, or any 
other symptoms although pt is unreliable in giving ROS.  
At his baseline, he is not very communicative and is confused 
most of the times, per his grandchildren. Pt has become 
increasingly more confused and combative over the last few days, 
refusing medications and food.  
Unable to assess ROS as patient not responding to questions.  
.
On admission, pt started on vancomycin and levaquin. This was 
changed to vanco, ceftriaxone, azithro and flaygl today as pt 
had increasing hypoxia and increasing opacity on R lung on CXR 
from early this AM. MICU called to evaluate for persistent O2 
sat in mid 80s on 100% NRB. Antibiotics then changed to Vanco, 
Zosyn, Azithro for coverage of MDR pseudomonas. He was tx'd to 
the MICU for worsening hypoxia.

IMAGING:

Admit CXR ([**12-17**]): 
IMPRESSION:
Limited by rotation. Probably unchanged appearance of peripheral 
reticular pattern predominantly in the lower lobes. No pneumonia 
or CHF. New right- sided lower rib fractures.

Bilateral LENI's: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein 
thrombosis.
.
Chest CT ([**12-19**]): 
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Fractures of the 9th and 10th ribs on the right, 
nondisplaced.
3. Bilateral posterior atelectasis and pleural effusions.
4. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
5. Ulcerated plaques in the descending aorta.
6. Possible right adrenal adenoma.
.
Follow Up CXR ([**12-22**]): IMPRESSION: Improved aeration of the right 
lung base. Otherwise, no significant change from prior study.
.
CXR [**2924-12-22**]
IMPRESSION: Improved aeration of the right lung base. Otherwise, 
no significant change from prior study.
.
CXR [**2924-12-26**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings consistent with CHF.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions.
.
CXR [**2924-12-31**]
There is mild-to-moderate congestive heart failure superimposed 
on underlying emphysema, which is associated with cardiomegaly 
and moderate-sized pleural effusion. There are continued 
opacities in both lower lobes indicating atelectasis versus 
aspiration pneumonia. No evidence of pneumothorax is identified. 
Again, note is made of tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
.
CXR [**2925-1-1**]
IMPRESSION: Moderate bilateral pleural effusions unchanged.
.
CXR [**2925-1-3**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild improvement of pleural effusion on the right.
2. Bibasilar consolidations which may reflect atelectasis or 
pneumonia, especially on the left.
3. Radiological evidence of mild congestive heart failure.
.
CXR [**2925-1-7**]
FINDINGS: Bilateral effusions are much more prominent on the 
current study. Positioning differences could contribute. Appears 
to be more prominence of the upper lobe pulmonary vasculature 
and decompensation of fluid status seems likely. Bibasilar 
atelectatic changes are noted, greater than that seen 
previously. Upper lungs are clear of consolidations.
IMPRESSION:
Worsened fluid status versus prior study.
.
CXR [**2925-1-8**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Partial improvement in congestive heart failure.
2. Unchanged moderate left and small right pleural effusions.
3. Persistent right basilar atelectasis. Superimposed aspiration 
cannot be excluded.
.
CXR [**2925-1-9**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions, 
increased effusion on the right in the interval. A superimposed 
aspiration cannot be excluded.
.
CXR [**2925-1-13**]
Heart size cannot be accurately evaluated, but there is probably 
some cardiomegaly. There are bilateral pleural effusions with 
possible underlying pulmonary edema, essentially unchanged since 
the prior film of [**2925-1-13**]. Tip of PICC line overlies mid 
SVC. No pneumothorax.
.
CXR [**2925-1-16**]
FINDINGS: A left-sided PICC is in unchanged position with tip in 
the SVC. Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate-to-large in size, 
appear stable. There is improvement in underlying pulmonary 
edema and stable bibasilar atelectasis. No pneumothorax.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was a [**Age over 90 **] yo Russian-speaking man with history of 
interstitial lung disease, Alzheimer's dementia, and peptic 
ulcer disease, who presented from his nursing home with hypoxia. 
 Per his family for about 3days prior to admission he was less 
interactive than usual and was not taking food.  He seemed weak 
and on the day of admission did not even raise his head up when 
his daughter came to visit. She called this to the attention of 
the NH, who noted the pt was hypoxic to 74-84% on 2LNC, and 
started him on Levaquin on [**12-15**] for possible RLL pneumonia.  Per 
family, no cough, fever, SOB, or CP.  He was pale appearing.  
.
At baseline the pt used O2 2-4L for his interstitial lung 
disease. He was minimally interactive, did not speak very much 
even in Russian, and his overall health had  had been declining 
over the last year. Prior to that time he used to try to run out 
of his nursing home and build barricades to keep workers out.  
He was a slow walker with assist.  He was, however, strong, and 
had been combative requiring restraints in the ICU, and per his 
granddaughter he [**Name2 (NI) **] her the day prior to admission. He was noted 
to have been reluctant to eat for the last year, only taking 
food when fed by his family, and occasionally refusing to eat.
.
On admission, the patient was started on vancomycin and 
continued on levofloxacin for pneumonia.  His chest x-rays 
gradually evolved to a picture consistent with RLL and LLL 
opacities, likely pneumonia.  The pt was treated with 
ceftriaxone, azithromycin and Flagyl, but on the second hospital 
day he was transferred to the ICU after an acute episode of 
desaturation on the floor thought to be secondary to mucus 
plugging or aspiration.  In the ICU the patient was kept on 
levofloxacin, and after 5 days total, the vancomycin was 
discontinued. The patient initially passed swallow study but 
there was concern for possible aspiration after the family's 
attempts to feed the pt. The family was instructed to not force 
in food.  
.
The pt's remaining hospital course was significant for multiple 
episodes of desaturation, requiring deep suctioning and 
supplemental oxygen. During his worst episodes, he was requiring 
oxygen levels of 6L nasal cannula and 100% face mask; some of 
these episodes were precipitated by repeated attempts of the pt 
to manually remove oxygen supply despite wrist restraints and 
mitts. During one of the acute episodes of desaturation the pt 
underwent a chest x-ray which showed bilateral pleural 
effusions. The pt was diuresed with interval improvement of the 
effusions. 
The pt's underlying pneumonia was treated with Vancomycin, 
Levofloxacin and Flagyl (for empiric coverage of aspiration 
pneumonia). The pt remained stable in the [**Hospital1 **] with eventual 
improvement of oxygen saturations to low 90s on 50% face mask. 
After multiple family meetings, the health care proxy decided 
that they would like to continue medical care and they chose to 
change the pt's code status to DNR/DNI.   
.  
During this admission, it was noted that the pt refused to eat 
anything unless fed by family, including medications. The pt's 
PO intake continue to decline during the hospital admission and 
due to a risk for aspiration, the attending, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], 
decided that the pt should not have a feeding tube placed. The 
pt was evaluated by the gastroenterology team and they felt that 
the pt was a poor  candidate for PEG placement (of note the 
patient's health care proxy also refused this procedure).
.
During the hospitalization the patient had numerous episodes of 
desaturation which were precipitated by his attempts to remove 
his face mask. He was placed in restraints (after discussion 
with the family)to prevent him from pulling off his face mask. 
The pt was also assigned a 1:1 sitter. The pt was noted to 
maintain an oxygen saturation of 89-95% on face mask (with 
intermittent requirement of supplemental oxygen delivered via 
nasal cannula). Mr.[**Known patient lastname **] also needed frequent suctioning due to 
accumulation of copious thick secretions. His oral intake 
gradually declined and he refused to take food. At that time he 
was treated with supplemental IV fluids. Mr [**Known patient lastname **] gradually 
developed frequent episodes of hypoxia and tachycardia which 
were responsive to diuresis, suctioning and IV Lopressor. 
However,in the last few days prior to his death, his oxygen 
saturation status deteriorated and he was unable to maintain 
oxygen saturation above late 80s on 6L nasal cannula and 80% 
face mask. Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was also noted to be intermittently 
tachycardic and he was frequently in respiratory distress with 
respiratory rate up to 40. He was treated for respiratory 
distress with low dose morphine and with diuresis. On the day 
Mr.[**Known patient lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 3628**], he was noted to desaturate down to 50 and would 
not respond to deep suctioning or medical measures. He 
ultimately went into respiratory distress and had pulseless 
electrical activity and passed away.
