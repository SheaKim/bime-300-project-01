Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was initially admited to receive 7+3 chemotherapy on [**7-16**] on 
protocal. HLA typing was started. On day 13 bone marrow biopsy 
shoed no evidence of leukemia. Subsequently started on GM-CSF on 
protocal. 

THen, she spiked on [**7-27**], ceftazidime and vancomycin was 
started. On [**7-28**] she developed right sided throat/neck pain. 
Exam consistent with right tonsillar erythema and asymetric 
right sided swelling. Clindamycin was added for mouth anaerobes 
and started ambisome as well. Neck CT with soft tissue swelling, 
no  obvious abscess or fluid collection thru dental work 
artifact, so cant rule out completely. Repeat neck CT on [**7-30**] 
was normal. Clindamycin was changed to flagyl. 
Chest CT ([**7-28**]) showed 2 ill-defined nodules RUL, consistent 
with aspergillus so upped dose ambisome to 5mg/kg. Repeat CT 
with 1 nodule increased in size, so changed ambisome to 
voriconazole. 

Pt received wedge resection of the nodule. The path showed 
organizing penumonitis with fibrosis with no stainable organism. 
THe patient was continued on 
synercid/ambisome/voriconazole/flagy/cipro for neutropenic 
coverage. Synercid was subsequently stopped, b/c pt finished 
course of treatment for VRE in urine culture. Vanco started in 
place to broaden Gram + coverage. Diffuse macularpapular body 
rash (?aztreoname or ceftazidime?) continue to resolve. 
Continued issue with slow to heal and drainage from wedge 
resection site. Pain continued to require PCA fentanyl. 
[**Date range (1) 8416**]. WEdge resection site healed and pain (wedge 
resection/mucositis) improved. Mucositis has improved. Pain 
control switch to oxycodone prn. 

Patient continued from [**Date range (1) 8417**] with low grade temp 99-100.6 
with no obvious etiology. Drug fever is suspected and 
ambisome/flagyl was initially d/c. Fever continued at a lower 
temp 99-100. Vanco/Cipro was d/c. Fever continued. CT ([**8-13**]) 
showed R pleural effusion with some loculation, but no 
pneumonia. Per discussion with the ID consult, the loculation 
does not appear complex or septated or non-homogenous. Decision 
was made to hold off on the Thoracentesis. (also, pt was on 
broad spectrum antibiotic/antifungal prior to the appearance of 
pleural effusion.)

([**8-17**]) THoracentesis was performed due to continued fever 
100-101. Pleural Fluid was blood-tinged and slightly cloudy, 
800cc drained. Pleural fluid c/w exudate (malignancy vs 
infection; pH7.45, gluc 111, LDH 155, alb 2.1 (serum 3.0), 250 
WBC (18 poly, 21 lymph), 7500 RBC (10 mono). Pt spiked over nite 
and cx and CXR taken. Vanco and levo started
([**8-18**]) 1 bottle of central line cx show gm +cocci and cluster 
(along w/ hx of VRE in 1 urine in 6/15)->Vanco and levo d/c and 
started back on Synercid 570 mcg q8. 
([**8-18**]) BM show normal smear and flow cytometry was not done. 
([**3115-8-19**]).Flagyl added due to concern of C diff (due to long hx 
of abx, increased diarrhea and sudden increase of WBC over 1 day 
from 11K to 23K). All other abx d/c. SHe HAS SINCE defervesed. 
C. diff pending.

     CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are
     within normal limits.  There is slight interval enlargement of
     aorticopulmonary window lymph node and a left paratracheal lymph node.  There
     are no pleural effusions.  The lung window images reveal interval increase in
     size of an ill-defined nodule in the right upper lobe which previously
     measured 1 cm and currently measures 1.7 cm.  There is a small more linearly
     shaped and well-marginated nodule centrally in the right upper lobe which is

     upper lobe may also relate to Aspergillus infection, though this may also
     represent a non-calcified granuloma or other benign nodule.
     
     2) Smooth septal thickening consistent with mild pulmonary edema.
     
     3) Slight increase in the size of prominent mediastinal lymph nodes.  This may
     relate to pulmonary edema or underlying malignancy.

     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast helical CT of the chest.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3109-7-30**].
     
     CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is a new small pericardial effusion.  The
     heart and great vessels are unremarkable.  There are no enlarged mediastinal
     or hilar lymph nodes.  There is slight interval enlargement and number of
     bilateral axillary lymph nodes.
     
     The lung window images reveal very slight interval enlargement of ill-defined
     nodules in the right upper lobe both peripherally and centrally as well as a
     small nodule in the anterior left upper lobe.  There are no new nodules.
     Paraseptal emphysema is again noted as are small less than 5 mm nodules in the
     left lower lobe.  Stable scarring in the right upper lobe and left lower lobe.
     There is interval decrease in smooth septal thickening.  The airways are
     patent to the segmental bronchi bilaterally.
     
     There is a small hiatal hernia.  The visualized portions of the liver, spleen,

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: AML in remission. Evaluate ongoing lung processes.
     
     TECHNIQUE: CT of the chest was obtained, compared with the CT of the chest
     performed [**3109-8-3**] as well as chest x-rays from the last week. CT of the chest
     was performed with 100 cc of Optiray nonionic contrast. Nonionic contrast was
     given due to the patient's debility.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: Multiple bilateral sub cm axillary lymph nodes
     are present, unchanged in size since the prior examination. The largest of
     these in the upper left axilla measures 10 mm in short axis (previously 12
     mm). There is no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
     
     Examination of the lung windows shows a moderate right sided pleural effusion,
     possibly with some loculations. There is some atelectasis at the right lung
     base as well. At the biopsy site at the lower aspect of the right upper lobe,
     there is a 3 cm mass with air bronchograms, which probably represents a
     combination of the mass as well as hemorrhage from the recent biopsy. There
     are two parallel surgical suture lines adjacent to this, and adjacent pleural
     thickening/fluid collection as well. There are no new nodules or masses
     evident. The central airways appear patent to the segmental bronchi
     bilaterally.
     
     Examination of the upper abdomen shows hepatomegaly.
     
     Examination of the osseous structures is unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION: Right sided pleural effusion with atelectasis. The mass at the
     biopsy site probably represents a combination of the biopsy target as well as
     hemorrhage from the procedure. There is post procedure changes at the biopsy
     site as well.

     TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar pre and post contrast T1 weighted images, and axial T2
     weighted, susceptibility, FLAIR and diffusion weighted images were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     No area of restricted diffusion is seen to suggest an infarct. There are a few
     punctate foci of non-enhancing T2 hyperintensity in the cerebral white matter,
     perhaps related to ischemia. Vague high signal intensity projects over the
     inferior right cerebellar hemisphere on the axial T2 weighted images. No
     lesion is confirmed on the coronal images, consistent with artifact. Normal
     vascular enhancement is seen without definite leptomeningeal enhancement. The
     contents of the internal auditory canals are slightly hyperintense on the post
     contrast coronal and axial images. No pre-contrast axial T1 weighted images
     were obtained. They are also slightly hyperintense on the pre-contrast
     sagittal T1 weighted images without definite enhancement.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) There are a few nonspecific non-enhancing foci of T2
     hyperintensity in the cerebral white matter. 2) No definite meningeal
     enhancement is seen. CSF cytology might be of use.

     were obtained. They are also slightly hyperintense on the pre-contrast
     sagittal T1 weighted images without definite enhancement.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) There are a few nonspecific non-enhancing foci of T2
     hyperintensity in the cerebral white matter. 2) No definite meningeal
     enhancement is seen. CSF cytology might be of use.

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     HISTORY:  46-year-old woman with AML S/P chemotherapy now with a right facial
     droop concerning for leukemic infiltration.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Limited brain MR with 3 mm axial and coronal T1 weighted imaging
     through the brain stem.  No gadolinium administered.  This is compared to
     [**3109-8-30**] examination.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     Due to the lack of contrast administration, perineural enhancement cannot be
     evaluated.  No apparent thickening of the proximal 7th cranial nerve in the
     temporal bone is seen. No abnormal signal intensities noted in the brain stem,
     cerebellar pontine angle, or in the basal cisterns.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Limited brain MRI without administration of gadolinium.  No
     evidence of thickened proximal segment of the 7th cranial nerve in the
     temporal bone noted on the current examination.   Contrast enhancement cannot
     be evaluated on this non Gd enhanced brain MRI examination.

     MRI OF THE SPINAL CANAL.
     
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with AML and CSF with multiple leukemic cells
     and paraparesis with possible T8 sensory level, for further evaluation.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and T1 and T2 sagittal
     images of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine were obtained.  T1 and T2
     axial images of the lumbar spine were obtained.  Following gadolinium, T1
     sagittal images of the spinal canal and T1 axial images of the lumbar spine
     were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CERVICAL SPINE:
     
     Mild degenerative changes are identified in the cervical region with mild
     spinal canal narrowing at C6-7.  No extrinsic spinal cord compression or
     intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities are seen.  No abnormal enhancement
     is seen.

     THORACIC SPINE:
     
     Mild degenerative changes are seen.  No evidence of spinal cord compression or
     intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities are seen.  Mild enhancement is seen
     along the surface of the distal spinal cord from T10 to T12 level and
     inferiorly to the level of conus at L1 level.  These findings indicate
     meningeal enhancement on the surface of the cord.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Enhancement along the surface of the distal thoracic spinal cord
     and conus.  No intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities or extrinsic spinal
     cord compression.  No evidence of compression fracture.  Mild degenerative
     changes.
     
     LUMBAR SPINE:
     
     There is enhancement along the nerve roots of the cauda equina and also along
     the conus on the post-gadolinium images.  No evidence of a focal mass lesion

     INDICATION:  New lingular opacity by chest X-ray.  History of lung resection
     with pneumonitis and fibrosis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired axial imaging of the chest without intravenous
     contrast.
     
     CONTRAST:  None.
     
     COMPARISON:  The prior chest CT dated [**3109-8-14**] is unavailable for comparison at
     the time of this dictation.  The report was reviewed.  The chest X-ray of the
     same date was reviewed.
     
     CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:  A tunneled central venous access catheter entering
     via the left subclavian vein and ends at the cavoatrial junction.  Several
     small subcentimeter prevascular, AP window and paratracheal lymph nodes are
     noted. Multiple subcentimeter bilateral axillary lymph nodes are also present.
     Within the limits of noncontrast exam, the heart and great vessels are
     unremarkable. The airway is patent.  Linear opacities adjacent to the right
     horizontal and oblique fissures are compatible with old scarring and suture
     material consistent with the patients surgical history. There are few small
     areas of pleural thickening on the right.  A consolidative opacity in the
     lingula contains air bronchograms and correlates with the abnormality
     described by chest X-ray of the same date. There is volume loss of the lingula
     implying a component of atelectasis. There is no effusion.
     
     A small hiatal hernia is present.  The visualized upper abdominal viscera are
     otherwise unremarkable.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are detected.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Consolidative opacity in the lingula with volume loss concordant
     with the chest radiograph findings.  Please correlate clinically.

     INDICATION:  AML, acute onset pleuritic chest pain.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3109-10-26**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images from the lung apices to
     the lung bases were obtained before and after the administration of 100 cc of
     IV Optiray.  Nonionic contrast was used secondary to the rapid bolus
     requirement needed for protocol.  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were
     performed.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is suboptimal
     visualization of the pulmonary arterial vasculature secondary to injection of
     IV contrast through the central Hickman venous catheter and low venous flow
     rate.  No large filling defects are identified within the main pulmonary
     arterial trunk or first order pulmonary arterial branches.  Evaluation for
     filling defects within the second order branches and subsegmental level are
     limited. Remaining great vessels, heart, pericardium are all within normal
     limits. There is no pericardial effusion.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
     are present, which have increased in size since the prior study.  Again seen
     are several enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes within the prevascular,
     paratracheal, and subcarinal regions, not significantly changed since the
     prior study.  No pathologically enlarged axillary nodes are identified.
     
     Lung window images again demonstrate consolidation within the lingula which is
     not significantly changed since the prior study.  Additionally there is mild
     diffuse paraseptal and centrilobular emphysema present.  Mild scarring versus
     atelectasis is seen within the right upper lobe.  Adjacent to this area of
     scarring, there is high density linear material present, consistent with
     surgical sutures.  Additionally there is intralobular septal thickening seen
     within both lung bases, which was not seen on the prior study likely due to
     differences in technique, which may represent mild volume overload or be
     secondary to positioning. The airways are patent to the level of segmental
     bronchi bilaterally.
     
     In the visualized portion of the upper abdomen, the liver, spleen, adrenal
     glands, kidneys, pancreas are all within normal limits.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  A sclerotic focus is identified within the right lateral 7th
     rib, which is likely due to sequela of prior surgery within this region.  No
     other suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
                                                                 (Over)

     intravenous contrast.  Thin sliced reformatted images were obtained.
     
     COMPARISON: [**3109-10-27**] chest CT.
     
     CHEST CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There are small axillary lymph nodes
     bilaterally.  These are not significantly changed. There is a left subclavian
     central venous line with tip in the mid-superior vena cava.  Multiple small
     mediastinal lymph nodes are also present and are stable.  The heart and great
     vessels are normal.
     
     Scattered paraseptal emphysematous changes are present.  There is persistent
     unchanged consolidation in the lingula.  The prior seen ground-glass opacities
     located superior to this area of consolidation have resolved in the interval.
     There are no new opacities.  There are surgical sutures with post-operative
     scarring in the right lower lobe and right upper lobe. The appearance is
     unchanged from the prior study.  Bilateral dependent atelectasis is present. A
     sub-cm calcified granuloma is present in the left lower lobe posteriorly and
     there is a tiny pleural based nodule in the left upper lobe.  These are stable
     from the prior study.
     
     The osseous structures reveal no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.  There
     is a stable focal sclerotic abnormality within the right lateral 7th rib,
     which is likely post-operative in nature.  The imaged portions of the upper

                                     FINAL REPORT
     MRI LUMBAR SPINE:
     
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with AML.  Foot drop.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1, T2 weighted inversion recovery sagittal and T1 and T2 axial
     images of the lumbar spine were acquired.  The sagittal images extend from
     T11-12 to S5 and axial images extend from T12 to S1.
     
     FINDINGS:  At L1-L2 level mild disc bulging is seen with disc degenerative
     changes.
     
     At L2-L3 and L3-L4 no abnormalities are seen.
     
     At L4-L5 disc degenerative change and mild bulging is seen without spinal
     stenosis.
     
     At L5-S1 level no abnormalities are seen.
     
     The visualized vertebral bodies and sacrum demonstrate normal intrinsic signal
     without compression fracture or marrow edema.  The distal spinal cord show
     normal signal intensities.  Paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Disc degenerative change and mild bulging at L1-2 and L4-5
     levels, otherwise unremarkable study.  It should be noted that Gadolinium
     enhancement was not performed, therefore leptomeningeal disease cannot be
     excluded.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      46 year old woman with history of acute myeloid leukemia with history of CSF
      involvement. Now has neurologic changes with ""root signs"": weakness of hands,
      bilateral hip flexor weakness, and leg weakness. Neurology consult requested

      Please do MRI of cervical, thoracic/ lumbar-sacral spine with Gadolinium
      contrast, per Neurology recommendations. Thanks.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      rule out leukemic involvement of thoracic and lumbar spine roots vs. other
      lesion 
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Acute myeologenous leukemia with cerebrospinal fluid involvement
     Root signs on recent neurological examination with hip flexor weakness,
     bilateral in distribution.  Assess for leptomeningeal deposits.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar gadolinium-enhanced imaging of the entire spine was
     obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  Unfortunately, it is impossible to provide any more than gross
     assessment for leptomeningeal disease as most of the enhanced images are
     degraded by patient motion.  This difficulty is compounded by the fact that
     the prior abnormal study showed, at best, barely discernible areas of
     pathlogical enhancement in the lumbar region.
     
     At this time, no gross abnormal enhancement is seen.  There is no definite
     sign of spinal cord compression.  There is a somewhat diffusely diminished T1
     signal pattern within most of the cervical as well as the upper thoracic
     vertabral bodies. While this may be an artifact, even though the STIR image is
     not abnormal, one needs to consider the possibility of leukemic infiltration
     of the bone marrow. Again, it is to be emphasized that there is no overt
     spinal cord compression from epidural pathology at this time.
     
     CONCLUSION:   Poor quality study secondary to patient motion.  See above
     report for additional discussion.

     masses over iliac crest and sacrum.
     
     COMPARISON:  Made to the prior CT dated [**3109-8-19**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed following
     administration of 150 cc of Optiray contrast.  Noncontrast images through the
     liver were also obtained.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The visualized lung
     bases demonstrate interval development of patchy ill-defined nodular opacities
     at the left base.  There has been interval resolution of the right-sided
     pleural effusion.  The liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenals, kidneys,
     pancreas, and intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel are stable in
     appearance.  There is no free air or free fluid.  There is no pathologically
     enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal adenopathy.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is mild nonspecific
     thickening in the bladder wall with resolution of the previously seen air
     within the lumen.  The sigmoid, rectum, distal ureters, and intrapelvic loops
     of small bowel are unremarkable.  There is no pelvic or inguinal
     lymphadenopathy.  There has been interval development of small enhancing oval
     masses in the subcutaneous soft tissues posteriorly in the lower lumbar spine
     and sacrum.  The largest of these lesions measures 1.7 x 0.8 cm.  There does
     not appear to be invasion into the deeper muscle planes and soft tissues.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Interval development of patchy nodular opacities in the left lung base

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  History of AML now presents with right foot drop and palpable
     masses over iliac crest and sacrum.
     
     COMPARISON:  Made to the prior CT dated [**3109-8-19**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed following
     administration of 150 cc of Optiray contrast.  Noncontrast images through the
     liver were also obtained.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The visualized lung
     bases demonstrate interval development of patchy ill-defined nodular opacities
     at the left base.  There has been interval resolution of the right-sided
     pleural effusion.  The liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenals, kidneys,
     pancreas, and intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel are stable in
     appearance.  There is no free air or free fluid.  There is no pathologically
     enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal adenopathy.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is mild nonspecific
     thickening in the bladder wall with resolution of the previously seen air
     within the lumen.  The sigmoid, rectum, distal ureters, and intrapelvic loops
     of small bowel are unremarkable.  There is no pelvic or inguinal
     lymphadenopathy.  There has been interval development of small enhancing oval
     masses in the subcutaneous soft tissues posteriorly in the lower lumbar spine
     and sacrum.  The largest of these lesions measures 1.7 x 0.8 cm.  There does
     not appear to be invasion into the deeper muscle planes and soft tissues.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Interval development of patchy nodular opacities in the left lung base
     which are nonspecific and could represent infectious, inflammatory, or
     leukemic process.
     2)  Resolution of small right-sided pleural effusion.
     3)  Mild nonspecific bladder wall thickening, which is unchanged compared to
     the prior study, aside from resolution of the previously seen air.
     4)  Interval development of enhancing small superficial oval soft tissue
     masses corresponding to the palpable abnormality. Ultrasound-guided biopsy
                                                                 (Over)

     CLINICAL HISTORY
     
     46 year old female with leukemia and right foot drop.
     
     MRI OF THE LUMBAR SPINE
     
     This study is limited by motion.  Contrast was administered as patient was not
     cooperative.
     
     FINDINGS
     
     The vertebrae are normal in height and alignment.  This study is compared with
     similar examination performed on [**3109-12-17**].  The study is extremely limited
     secondary to patient's motion, and the study is also limited as no contrast
     was administered during this examination.  The remainder of the findings is
     unchanged since the prior examination.
     
     IMPRESSION
     
     Study extremely limited secondary to patient motion.  Study is unchanged since
     the prior examination.
     
     The study is limited as no IV contrast was administered due to non-cooperation
     of the patient.  If clinically warranted and if symptoms persist, a repeat MRI
     with contrast is recommended when the patient is more stable and more
     cooperative.
     
     Limited evaluation of the abdomen demonstrates questionable abnormality of the
     right adrenal gland.  Please correlate with CT of the abdomen.

     with new lower extremity weakness and clinical evidence of cauda equina
     syndrome.  Evaluate for leukemic involvement of nerve roots.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1 and T2W lumbar spine images were obtained with axial
     T2W scans of the L1-2 through L5-S1 interspaces.  Axial and sagittal T1W
     images were obtained following the administration of Magnevist.  Comparison is
     made to the MRI of the L-spine dated [**3109-12-22**].

     Gadolinium.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 180**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 351**] pager [**Pager number 12178**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The vertebrae are normal in height and alignment.  There is no cord
     compression or spinal canal stenosis.  There is no neural foraminal stenosis.
     Post Magnevist images are limited by patient movement during the examination.
     There are no areas of abnormal enhancement to suggest leukemic infiltrate in
     the arachnoid space.  There are no changes when compared to the prior study.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change compared with the lumbar spine MRI
     of [**3109-12-22**].  There is no evidence of cord compression, spinal canal stenosis
     or neural foraminal stenosis.  While there is no evidence on this study to

     obstruction and Clostridium difficile colitis.
     
     ABDOMEN, SUPINE AND ERECT:  Comparison is made to the prior study performed on
     [**3110-2-24**].  There is no free intraperitoneal air.  As before, there are mildly
     dilated loops of small bowel within the left hemiabdomen.  Gas is seen within
     the colon and rectum.  Scattered air fluid levels are identified on the
     upright view, many of which are likely intracolonic.  The overall pattern is
     most consistent with ileus.  Partial obstruction cannot be excluded.

     STUDY:  Chest radiograph in a patient with leukemia, rule out lung pathology.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3109-12-30**].
     
     A left-sided subclavian line is identified, unchanged in position.
     Postsurgical changes are identified in the right lung.  The heart and
     mediastinal contours appear normal.  There is some elevation of the left
     hemidiaphragm, not previously identified of undetermined significance.
     Associated with this, there is some minor atelectatic change in the left lower
     lobe.  No overt evidence of consolidation is seen.  The lingular opacity
     appears largely resolved.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     There is mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, previously not identified,
     and of undetermined significance.  Associated with this is some patchy change
     in the left lower lobe that likely represents some compressive atelectasis
     versus focal pneumonic change.

     INDICATION:  Acute myelogenous leukemia and mental status changes.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT imaging of the brain without intravenous contrast.
     Comparison is made to a prior CT of the head from [**3109-7-30**] and an MRI from
     [**3109-8-30**].
     
     CT OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT CONTRAST:  An intraventricular catheter has been
     placed with its distal tip located within the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 548**] of the left lateral
     ventricle from a right frontal approach.  The ventricles are larger than on
     prior exams and there has been the development of cerebral white matter
     hypodensity. This could be a manifestation of treatment effects and clinical
     correlation is needed.  There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage,
     mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures. The differentiation of
     the [**Doctor Last Name 8**] and white matter is preserved. There is no CT evidence of acute major
     vascular territorial infarction. There appears to be enlargement of the
     pituitary infundibulum.  Further evaluation with MRI is recommended to exclude
     an infiltrative process.
     
     Bone windows show clear paranasal sinuses with no evidence of fracture.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
     
     2.  A  catheter has been placed in the ventricles from a right frontal
     approach terminating within the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 548**] of the left lateral ventricle
     that is new when compared to [**3109-7-30**].  The supratentorial ventricular system
     also appears more prominent when compared to the prior CT.
     
     3.  Please note that MRI with gadolinium would be more sensitive in evaluating
     for subtle intracranial pathology in this patient with history of neoplasm.

     COMPARISON:  CT head [**3110-2-27**] and MR [**First Name (Titles) 4531**] [**3109-8-30**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2 weighted brain imaging without and with
     Gadolinium enhancement.  Diffusion weighted images were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  Compared to prior MR exam there has been interval development of a
     rounded enhancing lesion in the pituitary infundibulum as it joins the tuber
     cinereum. The enhancement extends into the optic chiasm.  No other areas of
     abnormal enhancement are identified.  Compared to prior exams, the ventricles
     are more prominent. There has been interval placement of a catheter entering
     the right frontal lobe and terminating in the left lateral ventricle.  T2
     hyperintensity is now seen in the periventricular white matter.  This is
     consistent with postradiation and chemotherapy changes, with the ventricular
     enlargement noted above more likely atrophic change as opposed to
     obstructive hydrocephalus. There is no shift of normally midline structures.
     No minor or major vascular territorial infarct is apparent.  The surrounding
     osseous and soft tissue structures are stable in appearance.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1. Interval development of enhancing lesion of the pituitary
     infundibulum, extending into the optic chiasm, which is worrisome for
     progression of the patient's known AML involving leptomeningeal structures.
     
     2.  Postradiation and chemotherapy changes observed in the periventricular
     white matter of of both cerebral hemisphres. 
     
     The above findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7490**] at 11:30 A.M. on [**3-2**], 2005.

     Gadolinium enhancement.  Diffusion weighted images were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  Compared to prior MR exam there has been interval development of a
     rounded enhancing lesion in the pituitary infundibulum as it joins the tuber
     cinereum. The enhancement extends into the optic chiasm.  No other areas of
     abnormal enhancement are identified.  Compared to prior exams, the ventricles
     are more prominent. There has been interval placement of a catheter entering
     the right frontal lobe and terminating in the left lateral ventricle.  T2
     hyperintensity is now seen in the periventricular white matter.  This is
     consistent with postradiation and chemotherapy changes, with the ventricular
     enlargement noted above more likely atrophic change as opposed to
     obstructive hydrocephalus. There is no shift of normally midline structures.
     No minor or major vascular territorial infarct is apparent.  The surrounding
     osseous and soft tissue structures are stable in appearance.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1. Interval development of enhancing lesion of the pituitary
     infundibulum, extending into the optic chiasm, which is worrisome for
     progression of the patient's known AML involving leptomeningeal structures.
     
     2.  Postradiation and chemotherapy changes observed in the periventricular
     white matter of of both cerebral hemisphres. 
     
     The above findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7490**] at 11:30 A.M. on [**3-2**], 2005.

     INDICATION:  Relapsed AML, with worsening nausea and vomiting, and recent SBO
     and C-diff colitis.  Neutropenic from chemotherapy, evaluate for SBO,
     worsening colitis, or other acute process.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3110-2-12**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained from the level of the lung bases
     to the pubic symphysis, with oral and IV nonionic Optiray contrast.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Surgical sutures are again noted in the right
     upper lobe.  At the right base, there are multiple areas of linear
     atelectasis.  In the posterior aspect of the right lung base, there are
     several focal areas of confluent nodular opacities, in a somewhat tree- in-[**Male First Name (un) 682**]
     configuration.  There are no pleural effusions.  The visualized portions of
     the heart and pericardium are unremarkable.  The liver and spleen are
     unremarkable.  The gallbladder is somewhat prominent and distended, however,
     shows no wall thickening/edema or stones to suggest cholecystitis.  The
     kidneys are unremarkable and excrete contrast normally. The pancreas appears
     normal.  There is no significant mesenteric or retroperitoneal adenopathy.
     There is no free air within the abdomen.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Since the prior study of [**3110-2-22**], there has
     been marked improvement in the level of small bowel dilation.  The proximal
     small bowel loops are now normal in caliber and appearance.  The small bowel
     loops within the pelvis are fluid filled, however, are not dilated.  The
     distal small bowel is decompressed.  Although no contrast is seen within the
     colon, air is seen to passing through to the distal colon.  There is no
     significant bowel wall thickening, to suggest worsening of this patient's
     pseudomembranous colitis.  No free air or free fluid is identified within the
     pelvis. No significant adenopathy is identified.  Foley catheter in place.
     
     IMPRESSION:

     distal small bowel and colon without evidence of recurrent/residual small
     bowel obstruction.   No contrast in distal small bowel or large bowel, which
     may be related to timming of the scan.  Follow up KUB could be obtained if
     clinically warranted.

     effusions are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     No radiographic evidence of active pulmonary infection.  If there is high
     clinical suspicion for atypical infection, correlative high-resolution CT of

     fever.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
     
     COMPARISON:  The comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph dated
     [**3110-3-5**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     The central venous line is unchanged compared to the prior study.  Note is
     made of new multiple parenchymal opacities in the right lung, and one of them
     has rounded contour.  In this patient with neutropenia, these are concerning

     TECHNIQUE:  Thin-section pre and post contrast sagittal and coronal T1-
     weighted images were obtained through the sella turcica region.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     As seen on the study eight days previously, there is enlargement of the

     compared to the study of [**3109-8-30**] and suggestive of involvement with the
     patient's known leukemia.  As seen previously, the hypothalamic disease
     extends superiorly, between the anterior aspects of the optic tracts.  No
     definite enhancement of the optic chiasm is seen on the current study.  New
     diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement is seen.  There is right frontal catheter

     CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 47-year-old female with acute myelogenous leukemia and
     questionable multilobar pneumonia on chest radiograph.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT images were obtained from the thoracic inlet
     through the level of the adrenal glands following the administration of 100 cc
     of Optiray nonionic contrast.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT of the torso dated [**3110-2-17**].
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  Small precarinal and AP window lymph nodes
     are identified, none of which meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
     There is a single 1-cm subcarinal lymph node, which is most likely reactive in
     nature.  The heart and great vessels appear grossly normal.  There has been
     interval development of circumferential thickening of the esophagus with a
     visible fluid level more proximally.  This finding suggests possible
     underlying esophagitis.
     
     Assessment of the lung fields reveals air space opacities within the right
     upper and lower lobes, with confluent areas of consolidation. There is a small
     right pleural effusion with fluid tracking along the right major fissure.
     There are postoperative changes within the right middle lobe, with visible
     suture material and probable associated scarring.  Minor patchy opacities
     within the lingula and left base likely represent atelectasis.
     
     Imaged portions of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.  Osseous structures are
     within normal limits.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Multifocal air space opacities within the right upper and right lower lobes as
     above with small associated pleural effusion.  This represents a new finding
     since the recent CT of the chest dated [**2-17**]. This appearance is most
     consistent with a multifocal pneumonia.  In an immunocompromised patient,
     atypical infection, including fungal infection, is a diagnostic possibility.

     CT chest dated [**3110-3-21**] compared to previous studies of [**3110-3-14**] and
     [**3110-2-17**].
     
     INDICATIONS:  AML.  Multilobar pneumonia.
     
     Helical CT of the chest was performed following intravenous administration of
     100 mL of Optiray.  Nonionic contrast was administered due to debilitated
     status of the patient.  Images were acquired with 2.5 mm collimation and
     reconstructed at 5 mm intervals throughout the thorax.  Additionally, a series
     of images were retrospectively reconstructed at 2.5 mm collimation.
     
     Assessment of the lungs again demonstrates multifocal ground glass
     opacification, as well as areas of dense consolidation predominantly within
     the right upper and right lower lobes with lesser degree of involvement within
     the right middle lobe and lingula.  As compared to the recent study, the
     degree of consolidation with respect to the amount of ground glass has
     increased within the right upper lobe.  Within the right lower lobe, the
     ground glass opacification has become more extensive and the consolidative
     component has also slightly progressed.  The right middle lobe opacification,
     which is predominantly in the lateral segment near the fissure has also
     worsened.  Minimal abnormalities within the lingula have slightly progressed
     in the interval.  Dependent ground glass opacities in the left lower lobe
     appear more prominent in the interval as well.  Background changes of
     emphysema are noted.
     
     Within the areas of consolidation, there is an area that appears somewhat
     nodular within the superior segment of the right lower lobe.  However,
     separate from areas of consolidation and there are no discrete concerning
     nodules in the lungs.  The central airways appear patent but note is made of
     retained secretions within the proximal trachea.  Regarding the consolidative
     areas, some of the abnormalities appear relatively wedge shaped configuration.
     Surgical chain sutures are noted adjacent to the major fissure consistent with
     prior wedge resection procedure.  There is a tiny lateral hydropneumothorax
     present.  This is also seen on the previous examination.
     
     Skeletal structures demonstrate degenerative changes in the spine.
     
     There are stable mediastinal lymph nodes.  There are also mildly enlarged
     right hilar lymph nodes, which are stable as well.  The heart size is normal.
     A small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
                                                                 (Over)

     Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, the adrenal glands are normal
     in appearance.  No focal abnormalities are seen within the liver or spleen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Worsening multifocal consolidation which remains most pronounced in the
     right upper and right lower lobes with adjacent areas of ground glass
     opacification.  These findings developed acutely and are consistent with an
     infectious process.  Although the imaging appearance is nonspecific, some of
     the consolidative changes have a relatively wedge shaped configuration.  An
     angioinvasive fungal infection should be considered but a multifocal bacterial
     infection is also possible.
     
     2)  Edematous appearance of the thoracic esophagus with wall thickening,
     beginning at the mid aortic arch level and extending throughout the distal
     esophagus with some retained secretions noted.  Esophagitis should be
     considered.  This has a similar appearance to the [**3110-3-14**] scan but is
     new compared to [**3110-2-17**].

       47 year old woman with AML,  multilobar pna.                                   
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Any evidence of pulm. nodules or fungal infection?                              
     No contraindications for IV contrast

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CT chest dated [**3110-3-21**] compared to previous studies of [**3110-3-14**] and
     [**3110-2-17**].
     
     INDICATIONS:  AML.  Multilobar pneumonia.
     
     Helical CT of the chest was performed following intravenous administration of
     100 mL of Optiray.  Nonionic contrast was administered due to debilitated
     status of the patient.  Images were acquired with 2.5 mm collimation and
     reconstructed at 5 mm intervals throughout the thorax.  Additionally, a series
     of images were retrospectively reconstructed at 2.5 mm collimation.
     
     Assessment of the lungs again demonstrates multifocal ground glass
     opacification, as well as areas of dense consolidation predominantly within
     the right upper and right lower lobes with lesser degree of involvement within
     the right middle lobe and lingula.  As compared to the recent study, the
     degree of consolidation with respect to the amount of ground glass has
     increased within the right upper lobe.  Within the right lower lobe, the
     ground glass opacification has become more extensive and the consolidative
     component has also slightly progressed.  The right middle lobe opacification,
     which is predominantly in the lateral segment near the fissure has also
     worsened.  Minimal abnormalities within the lingula have slightly progressed
     in the interval.  Dependent ground glass opacities in the left lower lobe
     appear more prominent in the interval as well.  Background changes of
     emphysema are noted.
     
     Within the areas of consolidation, there is an area that appears somewhat
     nodular within the superior segment of the right lower lobe.  However,
     separate from areas of consolidation and there are no discrete concerning
     nodules in the lungs.  The central airways appear patent but note is made of
     retained secretions within the proximal trachea.  Regarding the consolidative
     areas, some of the abnormalities appear relatively wedge shaped configuration.
     Surgical chain sutures are noted adjacent to the major fissure consistent with
     prior wedge resection procedure.  There is a tiny lateral hydropneumothorax
     present.  This is also seen on the previous examination.
     
     Skeletal structures demonstrate degenerative changes in the spine.
     
     There are stable mediastinal lymph nodes.  There are also mildly enlarged
     right hilar lymph nodes, which are stable as well.  The heart size is normal.
     A small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
                                                                 (Over)

     Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, the adrenal glands are normal
     in appearance.  No focal abnormalities are seen within the liver or spleen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Worsening multifocal consolidation which remains most pronounced in the
     right upper and right lower lobes with adjacent areas of ground glass
     opacification.  These findings developed acutely and are consistent with an
     infectious process.  Although the imaging appearance is nonspecific, some of
     the consolidative changes have a relatively wedge shaped configuration.  An
     angioinvasive fungal infection should be considered but a multifocal bacterial
     infection is also possible.
     
     2)  Edematous appearance of the thoracic esophagus with wall thickening,
     beginning at the mid aortic arch level and extending throughout the distal
     esophagus with some retained secretions noted.  Esophagitis should be
     considered.  This has a similar appearance to the [**3110-3-14**] scan but is
     new compared to [**3110-2-17**].

     INDICATION:  History of AML with pneumonia.  Elevated alk-phos, GGT, and
     abdominal pain.  Evaluate for evidence of liver or biliary disease.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the thoracic inlet
     through the femoral heads after the administration of 100 mL Optiray.
     Noncontrast imaging of the abdomen was also performed.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3110-3-26**].
     
     CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The heart and great vessels are unremarkable.
     There is no significant axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy. There
     is mild thickening of the esophagus.
     
     There has been no significant change in the consolidation within the right
     lower lobe.  The appearance of patchy opacities within both lungs is also
     unchanged in the interval.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder, spleen,
     pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable.  There is no
     significant mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  There is no free
     air or free fluid in the abdomen.  The opacified loops of bowel are
     unremarkable.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  A Foley catheter is present within the bladder.
     There is gas within the bladder, likely related to the presence of the
     catheter.  The distal ureters are unremarkable.  The rectum and sigmoid also
     appear to be within normal limits.  There is no significant deep pelvic
     lymphadenopathy.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic abnormalities.
