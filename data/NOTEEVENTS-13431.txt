Admission Date:  [**2765-5-28**]       Discharge Date:  [**2765-6-4**]

Date of Birth:   [**2681-6-14**]       Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital1 **] MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  An 83-year-old female, with
multiple medical problems including diabetes, hypertension,
heart failure, COPD, and a history of CVAs, who has been
experiencing dysphagia over the past year.  She presented to
[**Hospital3 **]Hospital initially, after she began choking on
a dinner of Chinese food.  A day prior, she had had
hematemesis, as well as some chest pain.  She was seen for an
initial evaluation at [**Location (un) **] where she was taken to the
endoscopy suite.  An EGD revealed a 10 cm esophageal tear
with bleeding consistent with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1148**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear, and
transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for further evaluation for concerns of
esophageal perforation.

On arrival, a gastrografin bowel study was obtained that was
negative for perforation.  Chest x-ray was negative, as well.
The the gastroenterology service was consulted.  Her initial
management was supportive with blood transfusions, and
empiric antibiotics.  She ruled out for myocardial infarction
via serial enzymes.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Diabetes mellitus, type 2,
complicated by triopathy, 2) CAD, 3) Congestive heart
failure, 4) Hypertension, 5) COPD, 6) Anxiety, 7) History of

ALLERGIES:  1) IV contrast dye.  2) ?valium.  3)
?benzodiazepines leading to confusion.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone.  She is a
nonsmoker.  She does not drink alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON PRESENTATION:
GENERAL:  Well-appearing, well-nourished, in no apparent
distress.
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.9, blood pressure 158/65, heart
rate 98, respiratory rate 23, O2 saturation 99% on room air.
HEENT:  Extraocular muscles intact, moist mucous membranes.
NECK:  No JVD.  No subcutaneous emphysema
CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm, distant heart sounds, no
murmurs.
PULMONARY:  Clear to auscultation with decreased breath
sounds globally and decreased effort.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, obese, normoactive
bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  Trace edema, no clubbing, no cyanosis, warm,
pedal pulses palpable.
NEURO:  Alert and oriented x 3.
RECTAL:  Guaiac positive.

LABS ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 12.3, hematocrit
34.7, platelets 187, INR 1.3, PT 14, PTT 38, sodium 138,
potassium 5.1, chloride 104, bicarbonate 26, BUN 31,
creatinine 1.2, glucose 168, calcium 8.3, magnesium 1.6,
phosphate 3.2.  ABG - 7.40/32/104.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  An elderly female presenting with acute
esophageal mucosal [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 1148**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] variant, explaining
her presenting bleeding.  Likely, she has other esophageal
pathology such as peptic strictures from longstanding
gastroesophageal reflux disease.  In her initial course, she
was treated supportively with blood transfusion to keep the
hematocrit greater than 30%, given her underlying coronary
artery disease.  She ruled out for myocardial infarction via
serial enzymes.  She was treated with empiric antibiotics
including ampicillin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  Following
blood product support, she remained hemodynamically stable
without further evidence of bleed.

Given her hemodynamic stability, the consultation with the
gastroenterology service, a repeat EGD was felt not to be of
utility on this admission, due to the inability to dilate in
the setting of this [**Doctor First Name 1148**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear.  Rather, a diagnostic
EGD after four to six weeks of esophageal rest, with proton
pump inhibitor prophylaxis, will allow for better
visualization, and perhaps tissue diagnosis.  While this is
likely a stricture, other processes cannot be ruled out, such
as masses or carcinoma.

Her hospital course was also notable for two days of
delirium.  This was in the setting of ativan.  Her mental
status cleared with discontinuation of the benzodiazepine.
She had no further issues in this regard subsequently.

With respect to her hypertension, her antihypertensives were
reinitiated upon achievement of hemodynamic stability.  Her
blood pressure was well-controlled subsequently.

With respect to her diabetes, she is on a reduced dose of
insulin, as her PO tolerance steadily increases.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  1) [**Doctor First Name 1148**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear.  2)
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.  3) Diabetes mellitus, type
2.  4) Coronary artery disease.  5) Congestive heart failure.
6) Hypertension.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  1) The patient will be discharged to
extended care facility.  2) Her diet should consist of soft
consistency foods/diabetic foods for the next 6 weeks.  3)
She needs to be kept on a proton pump inhibitor bid, for
example Protonix 40 mg po bid.  4) Her hematocrit should be
monitored on a qod basis to insure hemodynamic stability.  5)
Her fingersticks should be monitored qid.  6) The patient is
currently on 10 U of NPH in the am and 15 U of NPH in the pm.
As her PO tolerance increases, can titrate up to a home dose
of Insulin:  25 U NPH, 5 U regular in am; 35 U NPH, 5 U
regular in pm.  7) Refrain from giving patient nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatories or COXII inhibitors.  Also, hold Plavix
and aspirin for now.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient should follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 528**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7071**] at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 7817**] who is the patient's primary care
physician and cardiologist.  The patient will need a repeat
EGD in 6 weeks.  She may follow-up at [**Hospital1 19**] with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Name (STitle) 1817**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3108**].  Given the fact that she lives
quite a distance from [**Hospital1 19**], she can follow-up this EGD
closer to home if she prefers.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Hemodynamically stable.  Tolerating
soft foods without dysphagia.  Alert and oriented x 3.
Pleasant.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      84 year old woman with falling bp                                               
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      ?retroperitoneal bleed                                                          
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Hypotension post cardiac cath.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung bases to pubic
     symphysis without IV contrast.
     
     CT ABDOMEN W/O IV CONTRAST:  There are four small nodules at the right lung
     base.  The largest nodule measures 6 mm.  There is a massive retroperitoneal
     hemorrhage.  Blood products are noted in the right pararenal space extending
     along the psoas margin inferiorly.  Blood surround the lateral portion of the
     liver.  Inferior to the right kidney the hemorrhage measures 13 cm x 8.6 cm.
     The kidneys appear atrophic and demonstrate contrast enhancement from the
     prior cardiac catheterization.  There is minimal excretion of contrast into
     the collecting system.  The aorta is densely calcified without evidence of
     aneurysmal dilatation.  Multiple lymph nodes are present surrounding the
     aorta.  The liver and spleen are unremarkable. There is enlargement of the
     medial limb of the left adrenal gland.  The right adrenal gland appears
     unremarkable. The intraabdominal bowel loops are unremarkable. The pancreas is
     atrophic. There is no free air within the abdomen.
     
     CT PELVIS W/O IV CONTRAST:  There is a large right rectus sheath hematoma. The
     [**Doctor Last Name **] measure 85. Hemorrhage is not present below the inguinal ligament.  A Foley
     catheter is present within the urinary bladder.  The intrapelvic bowel loops
     are unremarkable.  There is dense calcification of the iliac vessels
     bilaterally.
     
     The osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION: There is a massive retroperitoneal hemorrhage.  The more acute
     blood products appear to be located in the right rectus sheath.  The
     hemorrhage extends into the right retroperitoneum.  There is hemorrhage
     surrounding the lateral aspect of the liver.

     COMPARISON: [**2765-12-8**].
     
     CHEST AP: The tip of the endotracheal tube is at the level of the carina. This
     can be withdrawn a few centimeters. There is moderate upper zone vascular
     redistribution with some pulmonary infiltrates consistent with congestive
     heart failure. Left ventricular enlargement is noted. ICD pacer leads are
     again noted. Tip of the right IJ line is in the mid SVC.
     
     IMPRESSION: Moderate congestive heart failure.

Nursing Note
[**2765-12-9**]  2200->0200

Received report from floor nurse ([**Hospital Ward Name **] 3). Received patient in CT scan, scan completed, and pt transported up to T/SICU. Pt transferred to ICU bed and placed on monitor. Pt agitated, restless, alert but confused to place and events. 

Dopamine infusing through left femoral cordis, held < 5 minutes while 1 unit PRBC rapidly transfused trhough warmer, then dopamine re-started; 2nd unit PRBC started through  right #22 PIV. RIJ TLC placed, CXR confirmed placement, and blood transfused through TLC. 

Pt receieved 2 units PRBC with HCT post transfusion = 28.1. After 4 more units PRBC, 6 units FFP and 2 packs of platelets, CBC results: Hct 28.1->24.3, Hgb 9.2->8.2, platelets 130K -> 188K, PT 19.7 -> 16.5, PTT 150 -> 75, INR 2.6->1.8., fibrinogen 150 -> 195. Other labs pending at time of code.

Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] aware of pt's BP being 100-120's on dopamine 3->2mcg, CVP 21- 8 with variability from minute to minute due to patient agitation. SpO2 99-97, respirations non-labored, u/o 25mL/hr x 2 hours.

About 3o minutes after last FFP completed, pt's BP rose and pt c/o difficulty breathing. LS absent in RLL, diminished markedly in LLL audible wheezes and tachycardia -> Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] alerted and in to see pt. Unable to obtain SpO2 reading from both hands, RLE, and forehead. RR high 20's with increased work of breathing, audible wheezes and increased agitation. SBP 170's -> dopamine decreased. Pt vomited copious amnt bilious drng suddenly without warning. Pt turned onto side with BLE log-rolled. Pt agitated, attempting to bend legs at hips. Suddenly pt became glassy-eyed with pale lips, smacking lips lightly, pupils fixed at 4mm, and unresponsive to verbal and motion stim. Anesthesia stat paged. Pt intubated, noted to have large amnt of gastric aspirate in oropharynx and ETT. Abd enlarging rapidly with SBP dropping from 100's -> 70's -> 50's while CVP rose to 20's and pulse ceased. Code called -> see code flow sheet.

Pt expired at 2:00a.m.
