Addendum:

COMPLETION OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Pulmonary:  Following transfer to the floor, the patient
required supplemental oxygen of 2 to 4 liters per minute to
maintain saturations over 90% which is likely close to her
baseline.  She has proven to be exquisitely sensitive to
narcotics and high percentages of O2 with respect to her
respiratory drive as both Ultram and O2 flow rates of greater
than 4 liters per minute and a resultant decreased
respiratory rate.  She was also continued on Flovent,
Serevent, albuterol prn and Atrovent inhalers.  She continued
to complain of shortness of breath with exertion, but not at
rest.

Heme:  The patient was continued to be anticoagulated for new
onset atrial fibrillation with goal INR of 2.0, but not
greater due to her baseline thrombocytopenia.  On day of
discharge, the patient's INR was 3.4 and the warfarin dose
was decreased to 2 mg po q hs.  The INR needs to be followed
closely given her low platelets and significant fall risk,
but she needs to remain therapeutic from now until she
returns for her cardioversion.  During her stay, Ms.
[**Known patient lastname 9905**]' hematocrit remained stable between 27 and 32.

Oncology:  The patient has a history of non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma and during this admission has complained of anorexia
and diffuse body pain.  CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis
demonstrated an increased retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and
splenomegaly compared to her previous CT.  The patient is to
follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 615**] with regard to her
oncologic care.

Cardiovascular:  Since her return from the Medical Intensive
Care Unit, Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9905**]' blood pressure and heart rate have
been stable.  Her transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
was preceded by an episode of bradycardia, but followed her
change from diltiazem to diltiazem ER.  She has been in
atrial fibrillation since admission with good rate control.
She is to follow up with the electrophysiology department at
[**Hospital6 273**]; that phone number is
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 9906**], within two weeks to schedule cardioversion.
This department here is aware of her situation and will be in
contact with the patient's brother to schedule an appointment
to discuss cardioversion.

Renal:  The patient has been diuresed on the floor for
congestive heart failure with Lasix with improvement in her
shortness of breath.  This required repeated oral potassium
supplementation.  She is being discharged on a standing dose
of potassium, but will require daily monitoring until her
diuretic regimen is stabilized.

Musculoskeletal:  The patient with a right sacral fracture by
CT, cleared by orthopedic for weight bearing activity and not
requiring additional intervention at this time other than
pain control.  If the pain worsens or fails to improve, the
patient may require an MRI to rule out a hip fracture.
However, she has adamantly refused MRI during this admission
due to claustrophobia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Calcitonin nasal spray 1 spray by inhaler qd
2.  Diltiazem 60 mg po qid
3.  Flovent metered dose inhaler 220 mcg 2 puffs bid
4.  Atrovent metered dose inhaler 2 puffs qid
5.  Lasix 40 mg po bid
6.  K-Dur 20 milliequivalents po qd
7.  Synthroid 100 mcg po qd
8.  Metolazone 5 mg po qd
9.  Ultram 50 mg tablets, �� tablet po q8h prn pain
10. Albuterol metered dose inhaler 2 puffs q6h prn shortness
of breath
11. Serevent metered dose inhaler 1 puff bid
12. Timolol malleate 1 drop both eyes bid
13. Warfarin 2 mg po q hs
14. Miconazole powder 2% 1 application to the skin bid prn
itching
15. Protonix 40 mg po qd

FOLLOW UP:
1.  The patient is to call Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 615**], her primary
care provider, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] schedule a follow up at the following phone
number ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 9907**].  Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 5246**] office has been called
to inform him of Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9905**]' discharge to [**Hospital6 9908**].  I personally spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 615**]
and he is aware of her situation and will follow up.
2.  The patient is also to call the electrophysiology
department at [**Hospital6 273**] within two
weeks at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 9906**] and ask for [**Doctor Last Name **] J. to schedule at
appointment to discuss possible left hip cardioversion.

     INDICATION:  Hypoxia and new onset atrial fibrillation.  Lower extremity
     edema.  Chronic venous stasis.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3140-3-11**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Pulmonary CT angiograhy with multiplanar reconstructions.
     
     MULTIPLANAR REFORMATS confirm the findings described below.
     
     CONTRAST:  100 cc Optiray, secondary to CTA protocol.
     
     PULMONARY CTA:  There is no pulmonary arterial thrombus identified.  The main
     pulmonary artery is slightly  enlarged at 3.4 cm, possibly reflecting elevated
     right-sided pressures.  The heart is enlarged and there is some reflux of
     contrast retrograde down the IVC into the hepatic vein, possibly suggesting
     the presence of right-sided heart failure.  In addition, there are minimal
     thickened septal lines at the  bases which may  represent interstitial edema.
     Previously identified patchy peripheral bilateral parenchymal consolidations
     have nearly completely resolved in the interval.  There is a single 8 mm lung
     nodule in the right upper lobe.  There are minor emphysematous changes
     present, better demonstrated on today's examination due to thinner slices.
     There is no lymphadenopathy identified.  The aorta contains a large amount of
     calcific plaque and thrombus and there is an area of ulceration of plaque just
     above the level of the diaphragm.  This did not appear to be ulcerated on
     previous study. The bones demonstrate marked degenerative changes and kyphosis
     without suspicious osseous lesions.
     
     At the visualized organs of the upper abdomen reveal a spleen that is enlarged
     though this is incompletely imaged.  This may be larger than on [**3140-3-11**].
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  No P.E.
     2)  Mild emphysema.
     3)  Stable right upper lobe nodule.
     4)  No lymphadenopathy.
     5)  High burden of aortic plaque with ulceration evident in the inferior

     INDICATION:  76 year old female with hypertension, osteopenia, and venous
     stasis, upper right leg which began suddenly and radiated down to the hip.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Multiple axial images were obtained from the lumbar spine without
     contrast, in addition coronal and sagittal reconstructed images were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  All five lumbar vertebral are visualized.  In the visualized
     portion of the T12 vertebral body, there is a hemangioma seen.
     
     There is a scoliosis of the lumbar spine with convexity to the right.  At the
     L1-2 and L2-3 levels, there is mild left neural foramen narrowing seen. At the
     L3-4 level, there is facet and ligamentous hypertrophy seen, but no neural
     foraminal narrowing.  At the L4-5 level, there is bilateral neural foraminal
     narrowing seen and canal stenosis.  There is facet hypertrophy seen
     bilaterally.  There is anterior osteophytes seen at the T12-L1 level and L1-2
     levels.  There is significant aortic calcifications seen.
     
     Along the right sacral ala, there is a linear nondisplaced fracture seen
     extending from the superior to the inferior portion of the sacrum.  It
     parallels the SI joint and does not appear to involve the sacral foramen.
     There appears to be gas within the fracture line.  No other fractures are
     seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Scoliosis.
     
     2.  T12 hemangioma.
     
     3.  Degenerative changes with osteophyte formation and facet hypertrophy seen
     throughout the lumbar spine, but there is more extensive disease at the L4-5
     level with bilateral neural foraminal narrowing and canal stenosis.
     
     4.  There is a right sacral ala nondisplaced fracture.

     INDICATION:  76 year old with a history of hypertension, osteopenia and venous
     stasis, presents with right leg pain.  Are there any fractures?
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the level of the iliac
     crest to approximately the level of the lesser trochanters without the
     administration of IV contrast.
     
     COMPARISON:  Direct comparison is made to a prior CT examination dated
     [**3140-3-11**].
     
     Arterial calcification is identified.  The sacroiliac joints display some
     subchondral sclerosis and vacuum phenomena and there is a small anterior
     osteophyte identified in the right sacroiliac joint; these findings are
     consistent with degenerative change.  Degenerative change is identified in the
     facet joints at the lower lumbar spine.  No fractures are identified.  No
     dislocations are identified.
     
     There is an oval soft-tissue density identified in the left hemipelvis
     extending to the level of the left iliac crest which likely represents the
     spleen.  The spleen did not extend to this caudal level on the prior CT exam
     and there is likely new splenomegaly.
     
     There is a 1.1-cm oval soft-tissue density in the anterior abdominal wall not
     present on the prior exam and attention to this region could be paid on any
     follow-up examinations; it is of uncertain significance.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) No fractures or dislocations are identified.
     
     2) Degenerative changes in the lower spine and in the sacroiliac joints.
     
     3) Likely splenomegaly which is new over the interval.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  76 year old female with hypertension, osteopenia, and venous
     stasis, upper right leg which began suddenly and radiated down to the hip.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Multiple axial images were obtained from the lumbar spine without
     contrast, in addition coronal and sagittal reconstructed images were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  All five lumbar vertebral are visualized.  In the visualized
     portion of the T12 vertebral body, there is a hemangioma seen.
     
     There is a scoliosis of the lumbar spine with convexity to the right.  At the
     L1-2 and L2-3 levels, there is mild left neural foramen narrowing seen. At the
     L3-4 level, there is facet and ligamentous hypertrophy seen, but no neural
     foraminal narrowing.  At the L4-5 level, there is bilateral neural foraminal
     narrowing seen and canal stenosis.  There is facet hypertrophy seen
     bilaterally.  There is anterior osteophytes seen at the T12-L1 level and L1-2
     levels.  There is significant aortic calcifications seen.
     
     Along the right sacral ala, there is a linear nondisplaced fracture seen
     extending from the superior to the inferior portion of the sacrum.  It
     parallels the SI joint and does not appear to involve the sacral foramen.
     There appears to be gas within the fracture line.  No other fractures are
     seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Scoliosis.
     
     2.  T12 hemangioma.
     
     3.  Degenerative changes with osteophyte formation and facet hypertrophy seen
     throughout the lumbar spine, but there is more extensive disease at the L4-5
     level with bilateral neural foraminal narrowing and canal stenosis.
     
     4.  There is a right sacral ala nondisplaced fracture.

     COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with prior CT's performed [**3140-11-6**] and [**3139-8-29**].
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous serial axial images were obtained from the lung bases
     to the pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of non-ionic Optiray
     contrast.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The visualized lung bases demonstrate
     bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar patchy areas of atelectasis.  A
     small bulla is present at the right base.
     
     The liver pancreas and left kidney are normal in appearance.  A low
     attenuation focus is again noted arising from the posterior aspect of the
     right kidney, too small to accurately characterize but unchanged compared to
     prior study.  Large gallstones are again noted.  The right adrenal is normal
     in appearance.  Low attenuation soft tissue density is seen within the region
     of the left adrenal and splenic hilum, possibly representing confluent
     enlarged lymph nodes versus enlargement of the adrenal.  There has been
     interval enlargement of the multiple periportal and to a lesser extent
     aortocaval lymph nodes.  The largest lymph node is in the porta hepatis and
     measures 1.9 x 3.8 cm.  There has been interval enlargement in the spleen.  A
     wedge shaped area of low attenuation is seen within the lateral aspect of the
     spleen consistent with a small splenic infarct.  There are scattered colonic
     diverticula.  A thecal lipoma is again noted, unchanged from prior study.
     Intra-abdominal loops of bowel are otherwise grossly unremarkable.  There are
     dense vascular calcifications.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Numerous sigmoid diverticula without evidence
     of diverticulitis.  The bladder rectum and intrapelvic loops of bowel are
     otherwise grossly unremarkable. There is no free pelvic fluid.  Small, sub-cm
     lymph node is again noted along the left pelvic side wall.  There is no free
     pelvic fluid.  There is no inguinal lymphadenopathy.

     HISTORY:  Hypertension, history of non-Hodgkin's lynphoma.  Pleuritic chest
     and back pain.  Assess for P.E.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained through
     the chest after the administration of iv contrast, according to the CTA
     protocol.
     
     COMPARISON: CHEST CT OF [**3141-8-19**].
     
     CHEST CTA W/CONTRAST:  Soft tissue windows show no evidence of intra-arterial
     filling defects.  There are a few subcm mediastinal lymph nodes, none of which
     meet strict CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.  There are no enlarged
     hilar or axillary lymph nodes.  The heart and pericardium are unremarkable.
     Again noted, are diffuse plaques of the intrathoracic aorta. There are no
     pleural effusions.  Lung windows demonstrate no interval change in the right
     upper lobe nodule.  There has been interval increase in ground glass
     opacifications, predominantly involving the upper lung zones.  Increased
     atelectasis is noted at the lung bases with increased patchy opacities of the
     right lower lobe .  There are mild emphysematous changes.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate stable appearance of the osseous structures since the
     previous exam.
     
     Limited views of the upper abdomen again show a prominent spleen.  The
     partially visualized liver is unchanged in appearance.
     
     MULTIPLANAR REFORMATTED IMAGES confirm the above findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
     
     2)  Slight interval increase in the amount of diffuse ground glass opacities,
     predominantly involving the upper lung zones, and patchy opacities of the
     right lower lobe.  Given their rapidity of onset, these findings may represent
     an infectious viral/fungal process. Correlation with patient's clinical exam
     is recommended.

     HISTORY:  Seventy-six year old woman who has an elevated alk phos level,  
     elevated total bilirubin, and a positive [**Doctor Last Name **] sign.  By ultrasound, she has
     gallbladder wall thickening and cholelithiasis.  Symptomatically she has right
     upper quadrant pain with rebound.   
      
     INTERPRETATION:  Serial images over the abdomen show normal uptake of tracer
     into the hepatic parenchyma.  At approximately 29 minutes, tracer activity is
     noted in the small bowel.  After 76 minutes of imaging, no tracer could be
     visualized within the gallbladder.  2 mg of morphine were administered IV. 
     Imaging was then continued for another 30 minutes.  Again, the gallbladder was
     not visualized after 30 minutes of additional imaging.

     which now measures 9 mm.  Multiple shadowing gallstones are identified.  There
     is hyperemia of the gallbladder wall.  The common bile duct measures 8-9 mm in
     greatest dimension.  This is slightly increased from the prior study, where
     the maximal measurement was 6 mm.  No definite stones are seen within the
     distal common bile duct.  There is no intrahepatic ductal dilatation.  No
     fluid is identified.  No other significant interval change since the prior
     study.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Positive sonographic [**Doctor Last Name **] sign with gallbladder wall thickening
     and multiple gallstones are consistent with acute cholecystitis.  There is
     increased gallbladder wall thickening and the common bile duct is slightly
     larger as described above.  No definite obstructing stones are seen in the
     common bile duct.

     FINDINGS:  There is diffuse increased attenuation in the subcutaneous fat
     representing edema along with thickening of the septa within the fat.  There
     is no hematoma or abnormal fluid collection in the thigh or hip region.  There
     is calcification of the artery and superficial venous varicosities noted.  The
     right thigh which is partially imaged demonstrates a lesser degree of soft-
     tissue swelling.  There is a Foley catheter present within a collapsed
     bladder.  The bones demonstrate a serpiginous sclerotic area in the medullary
     cavity of the proximal femur which is eccentrically located.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) Edema without hematoma or abscess.
     2) Sclerotic lesion in proximal femur most likely represents a bone infarct

     INDICATION: Gram-negative sepsis and rising bilirubin. History of recent
     cholecystitis. 
     
     RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: Multiple shadowing gallstones and sludge are
     seen within the gallbladder. In comparison to the prior study of [**3141-9-2**], gallbladder wall thickening has resolved. There is no pericholecystic
     fluid or significant gallbladder distention. The common duct measures 4 mm
     proximally and widens up to 9 mm distally. These measurements are unchanged
     from the prior study. No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation has developed.
     The visualized head and body of the pancreas are normal. Shadowing from
     gallstones obscures more proximal portions of the common duct and cystic duct.
     
     IMPRESSION: Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis. The gallbladder
     wall thickening seen on the prior study of [**3141-9-2**] is no longer
     present. Common duct measurements are unchanged.
