Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3039**] 
Chief Complaint:
GIB
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is an 81 yo f with a history of diverticulosis and 2 
recent episodes of GIB who had another GIB on [**3086-9-1**] prompting 
her admission to [**Hospital 370**] Hospital. In the AM of 10/11, patient 
had mild incontinence followed by a bloody bowel movement, 
accompanied by clots. She described a dark hue to the contents 
of her BM. Then, on the AM of 10/12, she had another bloody BM. 
She denied any lightheadedness, changes in vision, abdominal 
pain or chest pain with these episodes. (Though, a note from the 
[**Hospital1 370**] ED notes that the patient had a syncopal type episode 
while in the ED) She had a tagged RBC scan which was unable to 
identify the source of bleeding. Hence, she is being transferred 
here with the objective of IR guided embolization. On admission 
to [**Hospital 370**] hospital, her Hct dropped from 30->22. She was 
transfused with 2U PRBC and given 2 PIVs. Her Hct rose from 22 
to 25.4 and thus she was transfused another 2 units PRBCs.

Brief Hospital Course:
# GIB: 81 yo f with PMH diverticulosis and history of GIB was 
transferred from OSH with recent GIB. Per report, source was 
identified on tagged RBC at OSH and she was transferred here for 
IR embolization. We obtained records from [**Hospital 370**] Hospital 
which showed that the tagged RBC scan didn't reveal any source 
of bleeding. Pt had a previous colonoscopy which showed severe 
left sided diverticulosis. Pt's source of recent GIB was most 
likely secondary to diverticulosis. During this hospitalization, 
pt didn't have any bowel movements. Serial hematocrits remained 
stable. Pt was evaluated by IR and surgery who didn't feel that 
any immediately intervention was indicated. Pt was evaluated by 
GI who recommended a repeat colonoscopy. If pt were to re-bleed, 
she will need a repeat tagged RBC scan and possible 
embolization. Please continue to check serial BID hematocrits. 
Pt has not had a BM in 4 days - please titrate bowel 
medications, for a BM.

.  
# CRI:  Lisinopril was held in setting of elevated creatinine. 
Further data revealed that baseline creat is around 1.8, and pt 
was restarted on Lisinopril. Urine lytes showed low FeNa and 
FeUrea, suggestive of pre-renal state; however, urine Na was not 
low. Clinically pt appears to be volume overloaded.
.
# CHF: Pt noted to be in mild CHF, likely in setting of volume 
rescusitation. Pt has bilateral pleural effusions. Pt was 
diuresed with IV Lasix. Pt needs to continue with diuresis. Echo 
was performed - final read is pending. Prelim tech read is 
normal EF with evidence of obstructive hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy.
.
# HTN: - Initially BP meds were held in setting of GIB. Then, pt 
was restarted on lopressor and lower dose of nifedipine. 
Lisinopril was initially held in setting of elevated creatinine, 
and pt was put on IV hydralazine. Further data revealed that 
creatinine is at baseline, so Lisinopril was restarted. Pt was 
also restarted on home dose of nifedipine.

.  
# RUE swelling: Pt was noted to have RUE swelling, which is most 
likely secondary to IV infilatration. RUE U/S was negative for 
DVT. 
.  
# Hypercholesterolemia: Pt was continued on lipitor.  
.  
# Code: DNR/DNI - confirmed with patient.

Events:  HCT stable, continues to be hypertensive, vital signs stable.

Cardiac:  B/P 157-165/50's until 1100 when her B/P increased to 184/56.  She was given her hydralazine early and her B/P decreased back to the 170's/. She was started on lopressor at 100mg tid and given her first dose at 1500.  Her lipitor was also restarted.  Her HR has been 86-110, SR/ST with no ectopy.  She appears to be dry with Na ov 146, dry mouth and marginal urine output, so she was given 2 boluses of 250cc NS and her IVF was changed from NS to 1/2 NS at 100cc/hr.

GI:  Her Hct has been stable and actually increased from 31 ->36 at 1400.  She has had no signs of bleeding with no stool today.  She did c/o nausea at 1300 and received 12.5mg of anzemet.  She coughed up a large mucous plug, no emesis and she fell asleep.  When she woke up she felt better.

GU:  Foley draining clear yellow urine. U/O 30-80cc/hr.

Resp:  breath sounds clear and her O2 sats on 2l NC are 98-100%.  RR 17-22

Neuro:  She has been napping most of the day (""I didn't get much [**Doctor Last Name 8**] last night with them sticking me so much"").  Easily arousable, then alert and oriented.  MAE and able to help with care.

     RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA:
        15.0 mCi Tc-99m RBC ([**3086-10-10**]);
     HISTORY: 81 year old female with active sigmoid colon bleeding seen on bleeding
     study at outside hospital this morning. 
      
     INTERPRETATION:  Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells 
     labeled with Tc-99m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen for minutes 
     were obtained.  A left lateral view of the pelvis was also obtained. 
      
     Blood flow images are normal. 
      
     Dynamic blood pool images show increased tracer uptake in the left lower
     quadrant at approximately 15 minutes and increasing in this location throughout
     the duration of the examination (approx 60 minutes). 
      
     IMPRESSION:  Active GI bleed in the left lower quadrant at 15 minutes,
     consistent with a bleed in the sigmoid colon.  These findings were discussed at
     the immediate identification of hemorrhage with the ordering physician [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4522**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4523**], and the Interventional Radiology resident, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 340**] arranged for a
     mesenteric angiogram and possible embolization.

     HISTORY:  Lower GI bleed.  Being transfused.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**3086-9-2**]:
     
     Moderate cardiomegaly has progressed, vascular engorgement of the hila is
     stable, lungs are clear.  Thoracic aorta is generally large and heavily
     calcified.  Small regions of aneurysmal dilatation cannot be excluded,
     particularly in the region of the aortic arch.
     
     Mediastinal widening and tracheal narrowing at and above the thoracic inlet
     are most likely due to a large thyroid gland.
     
     Small right pleural effusion may be present.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      81 year old woman with LGIB on tagged RBC scan                                  
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      assess location of bleeding vessel and embolize as appropriate                  
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Lower GI bleeding.  Tagged red cell blood scan was performed
     demonstrating bleeding in the sigmoid colon.
     
     PROCEDURE:  This procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 340**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 609**].  Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 609**], the attending radiologist, was present during the entire procedure
     supervising.  The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the
     patient and informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the
     angiography table and placed in supine position.  A preprocedure timeout was
     performed and proper identification of the patient and the procedure was
     performed.  The right groin was then prepped and draped in standard sterile
     fashion.  The right common femoral artery was then accessed and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 528**] wire
     was introduced into the aorta.  The needle was then exchanged for a 5 French
     sheath.  Using a C2 Cobra catheter, we were able to cannulate the SMA.
     Selective angiogram of the SMA demonstrated a patent artery with no evidence
     of acute hemorrhage or hemodynamically significant stenosis.  There was a 9-mm
     aneurysm in a proximal jejunal branch.
     
     We then attempted to cannulate the [**Female First Name (un) **] several times with using the C2
     catheter as well as the Mickaelson and [**Doctor Last Name 2272**] catheters without success.  We
     then decided to perform an aortogram to determine the origin of the [**Female First Name (un) **].  An
     infrarenal PA and lateral aortogram demonstrated extensive atherosclerotic
     disease of the abdominal aorta and iliacs without hemodynamically significant
     stenosis. The aorta was of normal caliber.  Specifically, the inferior
     mesenteric artery was identified and was opacified.  No acute hemorrhage was
     identified on the aortogram.  We then attempted several times to cannulate
     selectively the inferior mesenteric artery, without success.  Multiple
     catheters were used.
     
     The catheter wire and sheath were then removed and pressure was held at the
     right groin for 20 minutes and hemostasis was achieved.  The patient tolerated
     the procedure well and there were no complications.
                                                                 (Over)

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      81 year old woman with LGIB on tagged RBC scan                                  
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      assess location of bleeding vessel and embolize as appropriate                  
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Lower GI bleeding.  Tagged red cell blood scan was performed
     demonstrating bleeding in the sigmoid colon.
     
     PROCEDURE:  This procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 340**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 609**].  Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 609**], the attending radiologist, was present during the entire procedure
     supervising.  The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the
     patient and informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the
     angiography table and placed in supine position.  A preprocedure timeout was
     performed and proper identification of the patient and the procedure was
     performed.  The right groin was then prepped and draped in standard sterile
     fashion.  The right common femoral artery was then accessed and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 528**] wire
     was introduced into the aorta.  The needle was then exchanged for a 5 French
     sheath.  Using a C2 Cobra catheter, we were able to cannulate the SMA.
     Selective angiogram of the SMA demonstrated a patent artery with no evidence
     of acute hemorrhage or hemodynamically significant stenosis.  There was a 9-mm
     aneurysm in a proximal jejunal branch.
     
     We then attempted to cannulate the [**Female First Name (un) **] several times with using the C2
     catheter as well as the Mickaelson and [**Doctor Last Name 2272**] catheters without success.  We
     then decided to perform an aortogram to determine the origin of the [**Female First Name (un) **].  An
     infrarenal PA and lateral aortogram demonstrated extensive atherosclerotic
     disease of the abdominal aorta and iliacs without hemodynamically significant
     stenosis. The aorta was of normal caliber.  Specifically, the inferior
     mesenteric artery was identified and was opacified.  No acute hemorrhage was
     identified on the aortogram.  We then attempted several times to cannulate
     selectively the inferior mesenteric artery, without success.  Multiple
     catheters were used.
     
     The catheter wire and sheath were then removed and pressure was held at the
     right groin for 20 minutes and hemostasis was achieved.  The patient tolerated
     the procedure well and there were no complications.
                                                                 (Over)

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      81 year old woman with LGIB on tagged RBC scan                                  
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      assess location of bleeding vessel and embolize as appropriate                  
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Lower GI bleeding.  Tagged red cell blood scan was performed
     demonstrating bleeding in the sigmoid colon.
     
     PROCEDURE:  This procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 340**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 609**].  Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 609**], the attending radiologist, was present during the entire procedure
     supervising.  The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the
     patient and informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the
     angiography table and placed in supine position.  A preprocedure timeout was
     performed and proper identification of the patient and the procedure was
     performed.  The right groin was then prepped and draped in standard sterile
     fashion.  The right common femoral artery was then accessed and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 528**] wire
     was introduced into the aorta.  The needle was then exchanged for a 5 French
     sheath.  Using a C2 Cobra catheter, we were able to cannulate the SMA.
     Selective angiogram of the SMA demonstrated a patent artery with no evidence
     of acute hemorrhage or hemodynamically significant stenosis.  There was a 9-mm
     aneurysm in a proximal jejunal branch.
     
     We then attempted to cannulate the [**Female First Name (un) **] several times with using the C2
     catheter as well as the Mickaelson and [**Doctor Last Name 2272**] catheters without success.  We
     then decided to perform an aortogram to determine the origin of the [**Female First Name (un) **].  An
     infrarenal PA and lateral aortogram demonstrated extensive atherosclerotic
     disease of the abdominal aorta and iliacs without hemodynamically significant
     stenosis. The aorta was of normal caliber.  Specifically, the inferior
     mesenteric artery was identified and was opacified.  No acute hemorrhage was
     identified on the aortogram.  We then attempted several times to cannulate
     selectively the inferior mesenteric artery, without success.  Multiple
     catheters were used.
     
     The catheter wire and sheath were then removed and pressure was held at the
     right groin for 20 minutes and hemostasis was achieved.  The patient tolerated
     the procedure well and there were no complications.
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Lower GI bleeding.  Tagged red cell blood scan was performed
     demonstrating bleeding in the sigmoid colon.
     
     PROCEDURE:  This procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 340**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 609**].  Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 609**], the attending radiologist, was present during the entire procedure
     supervising.  The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the
     patient and informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the
     angiography table and placed in supine position.  A preprocedure timeout was
     performed and proper identification of the patient and the procedure was
     performed.  The right groin was then prepped and draped in standard sterile
     fashion.  The right common femoral artery was then accessed and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 528**] wire
     was introduced into the aorta.  The needle was then exchanged for a 5 French
     sheath.  Using a C2 Cobra catheter, we were able to cannulate the SMA.
     Selective angiogram of the SMA demonstrated a patent artery with no evidence
     of acute hemorrhage or hemodynamically significant stenosis.  There was a 9-mm
     aneurysm in a proximal jejunal branch.
     
     We then attempted to cannulate the [**Female First Name (un) **] several times with using the C2
     catheter as well as the Mickaelson and [**Doctor Last Name 2272**] catheters without success.  We
     then decided to perform an aortogram to determine the origin of the [**Female First Name (un) **].  An
     infrarenal PA and lateral aortogram demonstrated extensive atherosclerotic
     disease of the abdominal aorta and iliacs without hemodynamically significant
     stenosis. The aorta was of normal caliber.  Specifically, the inferior
     mesenteric artery was identified and was opacified.  No acute hemorrhage was
     identified on the aortogram.  We then attempted several times to cannulate
     selectively the inferior mesenteric artery, without success.  Multiple
     catheters were used.
     
     The catheter wire and sheath were then removed and pressure was held at the
     right groin for 20 minutes and hemostasis was achieved.  The patient tolerated
     the procedure well and there were no complications.
                                                                 (Over)

     HISTORY:  Status post left colectomy.
     
     COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated [**3086-10-12**].
     
     FINDINGS:  In the interval, the patient has been extubated.  A nasogastric
     tube is evident with the distal tip and side hole within the gastric fundus. A
     left internal jugular approach central venous catheter is again identified
     with the distal tip at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein with the
     superior vena cava.  Lung volumes are markedly diminished with bibasilar
     atelectasis.  The pulmonary vascularity is congested centrally with minimal
     interlobular septal thickening, suspicious for hydrostatic edema.  There is
     an atherosclerotic aorta.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged but stable.
     Surgical clips are incidentally noted overlying the region of the
     gastroesophageal junction.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Markedly low lung volumes with no consolidation.  There may be
     mild superimposed edema.

     with increasing white blood cell count.  Evaluate.
     
     COMPARISON:  Portable abdomen x-ray dated [**3086-10-20**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was performed following the
     administration of 120 cc of intravenous Optiray.  Nonionic contrast was
     administered per protocol.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were
     obtained.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH ORAL, WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Small bilateral pleural
     effusions, right greater than the left are seen at the lung bases, with
     compressive atelectasis.  The heart is enlarged, and moderate calcifications
     line the proximal coronary arteries.  The abdominal aorta, and proximal
     mesenteric vessels are densely calcified.  The liver parenchyma enhances
     normally.  There is a 5-mm low attenuation lesion at the liver dome, which
     likely represents a simple cyst, but is not fully evaluated.  The gallbladder
     is filled with oral contrast, likely due to reflux.  The common bile duct
     measures up to 10 mm all the way to the pancreatic head.  The imaged pancreas
     and spleen are unremarkable.  There is a 26 x 13 mm left adrenal nodule, which
     likely represents an adenoma, but is incompletely characterized on this study.
     Low attenuation lesions in the kidneys bilaterally are incompletely
     characterized.  In particular, an exophytic 15 x 14 mm right interpolar lesion
     appears to demonstrate peripheral enhancement.
     
     The stomach is diffusely distended and filled with contrast.  Multiple
     proximal small bowel loops are also distended.  An abrupt caliber change
     within the left lower quadrant suggests a transition point at this level.
     Contrast flows through to the rectum past the intrapelvic anastomosis,
     suggesting that the small bowel is only partially obstructed.  Stranding along
     the anterior abdominal wall, and below the subcutaneous staples is consistent
     with recent surgery.  No drainable collection is seen.  There is a small
     amount of high- density intra-abdominal free fluid.  Subcutaneous edema is
     consistent with volume overload.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH ORAL, WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  A 38 x 12 mm peripherally
     enhancing collection extends from the superior iliac spine along the inguinal
     canal.  There is a small fat-containing right inguinal hernia.  High-density

     patient's recent surgery.  There is no inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There is an old healed right ischial fracture.  The bones are
     slightly demineralized.  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
     abnormalities are detected.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Partial small-bowel obstruction, with a focal caliber change in the left
     lower quadrant suggesting a transition point.
     2.  Likely postoperative seroma within the right anterior pelvic wall
     extending to right inguinal canal.  The collection is too small to drain.
     3.  Findings concerning for fluid overload including minimal abdominal
     ascites, subcutaneous edema, and bilateral small pleural effusions.
     4.  Large left adrenal lesion.  Further evaluation with MRI or dedicated CT is
     recommended.
     5.  Low- density lesions in bilateral kidneys that are not fully
     characterized. In particular, one in the right interpolar kidney demonstrates
     enhancing wall. Further evaluation with ultrasound or MRI is recommended.
     6. Dense atherosclerosis.

     INDICATION:  81-year-old female postop day 11 status post subtotal colectomy
     with increasing white blood cell count.  Evaluate.
     
     COMPARISON:  Portable abdomen x-ray dated [**3086-10-20**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was performed following the
     administration of 120 cc of intravenous Optiray.  Nonionic contrast was
     administered per protocol.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were
     obtained.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH ORAL, WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Small bilateral pleural
     effusions, right greater than the left are seen at the lung bases, with
     compressive atelectasis.  The heart is enlarged, and moderate calcifications
     line the proximal coronary arteries.  The abdominal aorta, and proximal
     mesenteric vessels are densely calcified.  The liver parenchyma enhances
     normally.  There is a 5-mm low attenuation lesion at the liver dome, which
     likely represents a simple cyst, but is not fully evaluated.  The gallbladder
     is filled with oral contrast, likely due to reflux.  The common bile duct
     measures up to 10 mm all the way to the pancreatic head.  The imaged pancreas
     and spleen are unremarkable.  There is a 26 x 13 mm left adrenal nodule, which
     likely represents an adenoma, but is incompletely characterized on this study.
     Low attenuation lesions in the kidneys bilaterally are incompletely
     characterized.  In particular, an exophytic 15 x 14 mm right interpolar lesion
     appears to demonstrate peripheral enhancement.
     
     The stomach is diffusely distended and filled with contrast.  Multiple
     proximal small bowel loops are also distended.  An abrupt caliber change
     within the left lower quadrant suggests a transition point at this level.
