Allergies: 
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 18**] 
Chief Complaint:
GI bleed
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none 
 
History of Present Illness:
52 y/o M with cryptogenic cirrhosis, varices, who presents from 
outside hospital with GI bleed. He presented to OSH one day 
prior to admission after having melena and hematemesis at home. 
Reports throwing up both bright red blood and clots. In 
addition, he reported increasing abdominal girth over last 
several months. Denied chest pain, palpitaions. 
+Lightheadedness.  
. 
At the OSH, found to have hct of 35.1, INR 1.8. Given Vitamin K, 
FFP, PPI and Octreotide 50mcg bolus, followed by octreotide 
drip. EGD was performed [**9-2**] which revealed no active bleeding 
or red whale marks. Grade II-III esophogeal varices were seen, 
in addition to esophogeal erosions. There was no gastric varices 
and no blood seen in stomach. He was continued on IV PPI and IV 
octreotide. However, the following morning [**9-3**], he vomited 
moderate amount of emesis with approximately 50% clotted blood. 
At that time, hgb checked, found to be 11. Repeat EGD was 
performed on [**2931-9-3**], with banding of 3 varices. Transferred to 
[**Hospital1 19**] for further management. 
.
On arrival here, complains of mild abdominal pains secondary to 
distension. Denies chest pains, SOB. Passed one melanotic BM. No 
further hematemesis

 
Past Medical History:
# cryptogenic cirrhosis- initial onset of cholestatic hepatitis 
after having a cholecystectomy; has undergone numerous 
investigations, including cross-sectional imaging, liver biopsy 
and ERCP on two occasions. A complete serological evaluation has 
not shown any cause for his liver cirrhosis.  He has had two 
normal ERCPs performed at an outside institution. His liver 
biopsies here have shown features consistent with large bile 
duct obstruction 
# h/o arterial portal venous fistulae: noted within his right 
lobe of his liver s/p embolization
# jaundice at the age of 4
# DM II- insulin requiring w/ peripheral neuropathy, retinopathy
# GERD 
# CAD- 3 MI's in past, w/ 2 angioplasties, no stents
 
Social History:
He stopped drinking alcohol two years ago. Prior to that, he 
reports occasional ETOH use. 30+ pack year smoking history. 
Still actively smoking 1ppd
 
Family History:
No family history of liver disease. He has no history of blood 
transfusion or intravenous drugs.  He did snort cocaine 
periodically during his 20's.  He has never been a blood donor, 
does not have any
tattoos and never served in the military

MCV-100* MCH-33.5* MCHC-33.6 RDW-17.5*
.
LIVER U/S [**2931-9-4**]: 
================
Again noted is a small liver with nodular contour and 
echotexture consistent with cirrhosis. There is a slightly 
increased amount of ascites perihepatically and throughout the 
abdomen. The left main and right hepatic veins are patent 
demonstrating normal flow and waveforms. The left and right 
hepatic arteries are patent demonstrating normal waveforms and 
flow. There is reversal flow of the main, left, and right portal 
vein, which appears new compared to prior study consistent with 
worsening portal hypertension. The spleen is enlarged at the 
upper limits of normal. There is no evidence of fistula 
formation.

IMPRESSION:
1. Reversal of flow of the portal venous system, which appears 
new compared to prior study from [**2931-7-26**] and [**2931-6-24**]. No evidence of thrombosis or fistula formation.
2. Ascites 

Previous Studies: 
.
ECHO [**2931-8-24**]- 
Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: *4.4 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm) 
Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length: 5.0 cm (nl <= 5.2 cm) 
Right Atrium - Four Chamber Length: 4.1 cm (nl <= 5.0 cm)

Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: *5.7 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm) 
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 40% (nl >=55%) 
Aorta - Valve Level: 3.6 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm) 
Aorta - Ascending: 3.4 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm) 
Aorta - Arch: 2.6 cm (nl <= 3.0 cm) 
Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 1.2 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec) 
Mitral Valve - E Wave: 0.9 m/sec 
Mitral Valve - A Wave: 1.0 m/sec

Mitral Valve - E Wave Deceleration Time: 226 msec 
TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP): *20 to 32 mm Hg (nl <= 25 mm Hg) 
.
Conclusions:  
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.  
2. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed. Inferior 
akinesis with apical and distal septal hypokinesis are present.  

3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen.  
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial 
mitral  
regurgitation is seen.  
.
ERCP [**2931-7-31**]: 
12 ERCP images were obtained by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8839**].  Cholangiogram 
shows 
normal intra- and extra-hepatic ducts without evidence of 
dilatation or stricture.  No intraluminal filling defects are 
identified.  Cholecystectomy clips and vascular coils are noted
.
Liver Bx Path [**2931-7-10**]: 
.
Right liver lobe, needle core biopsy (A):
1.  Marked bile duct proliferation with associated neutrophils 
and cholestasis, see note.
2.  Mild lobular predominately mononuclear all inflammation with 
scattered neutrophils.
3.  Trichrome stains shows increased portal and bridging 
fibrosis and incomplete nodule formation (Stage 3).
4.  Iron stain shows minimal iron deposits in hepatocytes.
.
II.  Left liver lobe, needle core biopsy (B):
.
1.  Marked bile duct proliferation with associated neutrophils 
and cholestasis, see note.
2.  Mild lobular predominately mononuclear all inflammation with 
scattered neutrophils.
3.  Trichrome stain shows cirrhosis.
4.  Iron stain shows minimal iron deposits in hepatocytes.
.
Note:  The features are most suggestive of a chronic obstructive 
process (biliary type cirrhosis).  
.
Abd U/S [**9-3**]- bilateral hydronephrosis. Decreased renal function 
with poor response to lasix.
