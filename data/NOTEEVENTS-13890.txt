Reason: s/p trauma 

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
31 year old man s/p trauma 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
s/p trauma 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST

INDICATION: Followup PET/CT, status post trauma.

Multiple axial images are obtained from base to vertex without 
intravenous contrast administration. Comparison is made to the 
prior exam obtained same day at 6 a.m., 12 hours ago. The 
patient is status post evacuation of a right-sided cerebellar 
hemorrhage. This is mostly replaced by low density and small 
residual hemorrhage seen anteriorly. There is persistent sulcal 
effacement with extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage noted. A small 
left frontal contusion is again identified. Focal area of 
increased density is seen near the midline abutting the corpus 
callosum, suggestive of shear injury. There has been partial 
resolution of the small left frontal subdural hematoma. Small 
area of bleeding is also noted along the tentorium. A 
right-sided ventricular shunt is seen in place without 
hydrocephalus. There is soft tissue prominence in the 
nasopharynx related to the patient's intubation.

IMPRESSION: No significant interval change seen involving the 
extent of hemorrhage within the brain, left lateral ventricle, 
subarachnoid space, and small focal area of shear injury near 
the midline as noted previously. Patient is status post 
evacuation of right cerebellar hemorrhage. There is partial 
effacement of the posterior perimesencephalic cisterns. 
Continued followup is recommended.

MR CERVICAL SPINE

Reason: eval bleed and stability of c spine 

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
31 year old man with s/p hit by train, sm bleed in c cord 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval bleed and stability of c spine 
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Trauma, small bleed in cervical cord. 
Evaluate ___ instability of cervical spine.

FINDINGS: The cervical cord is normal in dimension and signal. 
Some abnormal signal in the posterior paraspinal muscle areas 
are identified consistent with the findings identified on the 
patient's CT scan and the previous evacuation of the right 
cerebellar hematoma. There is a small amount of abnormal signal 
in the subarachnoid space at the level of the foramen magnum 
posterior to the cervical cord not causing cord compression 
consistent with a high density area seen on the patient's CT 
scan of 9/7 probably representing some blood products associated 
with either the cerebellar hemorrhage or subsequent surgery. 
There is no evidence of abnormal signal within the vertebral 
bodies. Alignment is maintained.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of abnormal cord signal. No evidence of 
cord compression. Some blood seen in the subarachnoid space at 
the level of the foramen magnum. See above discussion.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**3199-8-19**] 11:25 AM

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: R/O Diffuse axonal injury. 

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
31 year old man s/p hit by train. 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
R/O Diffuse axonal injury. 
INDICATION: Status post hit by train. Rule out diffuse axonal 
injury.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging and 
susceptibility and diffusion-weighted imaging of the brain.

FINDINGS: There are abnormalities in the T2-weighted and 
diffusion-weighted images consistent with diffuse axonal injury 
of the corpus callosum involving the body and splenium of the 
corpus callosum and extending into the periventricular white 
matter posteriorly to the left posterior [**Doctor Last Name 221**] of the lateral 
ventricle. As previously noted on the CT scans, there is 
evidence on these MR images for diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
There is bilateral small subdural hemorrhage over the 
frontoparietal regions on the right more than on the left. There 
is a left frontal brain contusion. The patient appears to be 
status post evacuation of a right cerebellar hemorrhage. There 
are additional foci of diffusion abnormality near the midline as 
well as at the posterior aspect of both parietal lobes as well 
as in the right cerebellar hemisphere which likely re[resent 
Diffusa axonal injury. There is a right-sided ventricular drain 
in position, without evidence of hydrocephalus.

IMPRESSION: Evidence of diffuse axonal injury involving multiple 
areas including the carpus callosum, cerebellum, and 
hemispheres. Left frontal brain contusion and evacuated 
cerebellar hematoma. No midline shift or hydrocephalus. Diffuse 
subarachnoid blood and small bilateral subdural hematomas. Size 
of the subdural hematoma does not appear to be significantly 
larger than on the CT scan from [**8-18**].
 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was intubated and hemodynamically stable on arrival 
but had a GCS of 3. His evaluation revealed multiple injuries, 
the most concerning of which were his near-total left arm 
amputation and the right intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the 
cerebellum. He was seen immediately by Orthopedic and Plastic 
Surgery for the arm and Neurosurgery for his brain. His family 
was contacted in [**State 5794**] and he was taken to the OR for an 
emergency craiectomy with hematoma evacuation and amputation of 
the left arm. Please see the operative notes for details.

Both before and immediately after surgery the patient's 
neurologic prognosis was extremely poor, as was discussed with 
his family. Postoperatively he was admitted to the Trauma ICU, 
where his neurologic status remained unchanged. He was supported 
with tube feeds and IV fluids, and a family meeting was held to 
discuss his prognosis. A brain MRI was obtained and showed 
diffuse axonal injury. After more discussion, his family decided 
to withdraw care and elect comfort measures only. On [**8-20**] 
he was extubated and all tubes, lines and drains were removed, 
and he was placed on a morphine drip. He went into asystole on 
the evening of [**8-21**] and was pronounced dead by an ICU 
physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] medical examiner accepted the case.

     HISTORY:  Struck by a train.
     
     COMPARISON:  No previous studies.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a large right cerebellar parenchymal hemorrhage with
     adjacent edema, likely representing a hemorrhagic contusion.  There is only
     mild compression of the fourth ventricle at this time.  There is a thin
     subdural hematoma along the left convexity.  Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage
     is noted in the hemispheric sulci bilaterally.  There is blood in the
     occipital [**Doctor Last Name 67**] of the left lateral ventricle. There is a radial fracture of
     the right side of the occipital bone extending into the foramen magnum.
     Incidental note is made of a cavum septum pellucidum et Vergae.
     
     There is a comminuted fracture of the occipital bone in the midline, with a
     fracture fragment demonstrating 3 mm of depression.  There is associated
     pneumocephalus, possibly posterior to the superior sagittal sinus or torcular.
     There is extensive swelling and subcutaneous emphysema in the right and

     COMPARISON:  No previous studies.
     
     FINDINGS:  AP supine portable view of the chest.  Evaluation is limited by the
     superimposed trauma board structures.  The endotracheal tube terminates in
     good position approximately 5.5 cm above the carina.  The orogastric tube
     terminates in the proximal stomach.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours appear
     normal.  The lungs are grossly clear.  There is no pleural effusion and no
     evidence of a pneumothorax in supine position.  There is a partially
     visualized comminuted fracture of the left humerus.  Irregularities suggestive
     of fracture are noted in the left scapula.  Multiple rib fractures
     and a right scapula fracture, which are identified on the concurrently
     performed torso CT, are not well visualized on the current study.

     COMPARISON:  No previous studies.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial multidetector CT images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis
     were obtained with intravenous Optiray.  Sagittal and coronal reformatted
     images were performed.
     
     CHEST CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There are comminuted fractures of the
     right and left scapula.  Multiple posterior rib fractures are present
     bilaterally.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is no mediastinal hematoma.
     There is no evidence of aortic injury or tracheobronchial injury.  The patient
     is intubated, with endotracheal tube tip in good position between the thoracic
     inlet and the carina.  There is moderate dependent atelectasis in the right

     slightly less compressed than on the previous study.  The remainder of the
     ventricles is unchanged in size. There is a cavum septum pellucidum et Vergae.
     Previously noted bilateral subarachnoid blood products appear slightly less
     dense.  A moderate left frontal hemorrhagic contusion is now evident.  There
     is no shift of abnormally midline structures.  There is no CT evidence of an
     acute major territorial vascular infarction.  There is increased fluid in the
     sphenoid air cell and unchanged moderate opacification of the ethmoid air
     cells.  The patient remains intubated with an orogastric tube in place.

     AP CHEST 11:43 A.M. ON [**8-17**]
     
     HISTORY:  Central venous line placement.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**8-16**] at 9:21 p.m.
     
     A new right central venous line tip projects over the superior cavoatrial
     junction.  ET tube and nasogastric tube are in standard placements.  Widening
     and tubulation of the superior mediastinum has not changed appreciably since
     the earlier examinations, but configuration is worrisome for mediastinal
     hematoma.
     
     There is no clear pneumothorax or pleural effusion despite fractures of both
     scapulae and posterior ribs, described on the report of the CT scan performed
     yesterday.  For a patient of this age, the left paraspinal line is widened for
     maximally at the point of minimal scoliosis concave to the left, another
     feature concerning for spinal injury and hematoma.
     
     Heart is normal size.

     HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST
     
     INDICATION:  Followup PET/CT, status post trauma.
     
     Multiple axial images are obtained from base to vertex without intravenous
     contrast administration.  Comparison is made to the prior exam obtained same
     day at 6 a.m., 12 hours ago.  The patient is status post evacuation of a
     right-sided cerebellar hemorrhage.  This is mostly replaced by low density and
     small residual hemorrhage seen anteriorly.  There is persistent sulcal
     effacement with extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage noted.  A small left frontal
     contusion is again identified.  Focal area of increased density is seen near
     the midline abutting the corpus callosum, suggestive of shear injury.  There
     has been partial resolution of the small left frontal subdural hematoma. Small
     area of bleeding is also noted along the tentorium.  A right-sided ventricular
     shunt is seen in place without hydrocephalus.  There is soft tissue prominence
     in the nasopharynx related to the patient's intubation.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change seen involving the extent of
     hemorrhage within the brain, left lateral ventricle, subarachnoid space, and
     small focal area of shear injury near the midline as noted previously. Patient
     is status post evacuation of right cerebellar hemorrhage.  There is partial
     effacement of the posterior perimesencephalic cisterns.  Continued followup is
     recommended.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Status post hit by train.  Rule out diffuse axonal injury.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging and susceptibility
     and diffusion-weighted imaging of the brain.
     
     FINDINGS:  There are abnormalities in the T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted
     images consistent with diffuse axonal injury of the corpus callosum involving
     the body and splenium of the corpus callosum and extending into the
     periventricular white matter posteriorly to the left posterior [**Doctor Last Name 67**] of the
     lateral ventricle.  As previously noted on the CT scans, there is evidence on
     these MR images for diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage.  There is bilateral small
     subdural hemorrhage over the frontoparietal regions on the right more than on
     the left. There is a left frontal brain contusion.  The patient appears to be
     status post evacuation of a right cerebellar hemorrhage.  There are additional
     foci of diffusion abnormality near the midline as well as at the posterior
     aspect of both parietal lobes as well as in the right cerebellar hemisphere
     which likely re[resent Diffusa axonal injury. There is a right-sided
     ventricular drain in position, without evidence of hydrocephalus.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Evidence of diffuse axonal injury involving multiple areas
     including the carpus callosum, cerebellum, and hemispheres.  Left frontal
     brain contusion and evacuated cerebellar hematoma.  No midline shift or
     hydrocephalus.  Diffuse subarachnoid blood and small bilateral subdural
     hematomas.  Size of the subdural hematoma does not appear to be significantly
     larger than on the CT scan from [**8-18**].

     pneumonia.
     
     COMMENTS:  A single AP supine view of the chest was reviewed and compared with
     AP chest radiograph from [**3199-8-17**].
     
     An endotracheal tube is seen located in a standard position.  A nasogastric
     tube terminates in the body of the stomach.  The tip of a right-sided
     subclavian catheter projects over the cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax is
     identified.  The heart size is normal.  There is moderate widening of the
     mediastinum, which likely correlates to mediastinal fat as seen on recent
     chest CT. The lungs are clear.  No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces are
     identified. The pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits.  No focal areas
     of consolidation are present.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia or other acute cardiopulmonary process.

     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Trauma, small bleed in cervical cord.  Evaluate ___
     instability of cervical spine.
     
     FINDINGS:  The cervical cord is normal in dimension and signal.  Some abnormal
     signal in the posterior paraspinal muscle areas are identified consistent with
     the findings identified on the patient's CT scan and the previous evacuation
     of the right cerebellar hematoma.  There is a small amount of abnormal signal
     in the subarachnoid space at the level of the foramen magnum posterior to the
     cervical cord not causing cord compression consistent with a high density area
     seen on the patient's CT scan of 9/7 probably representing some blood products
     associated with either the cerebellar hemorrhage or subsequent surgery.  There
     is no evidence of abnormal signal within the vertebral bodies.  Alignment is
     maintained.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of abnormal cord signal.  No evidence of cord
     compression.  Some blood seen in the subarachnoid space at the level of the
     foramen magnum.  See above discussion.

Social Work
SW attended family meeting to discuss pt's condition and possible decisions around care.  All relevant family/friends were present.  They were informed that pt is showing no signs of meaningful recovery from a brain injury and is unlikely to improve.  Family processed this news after the meeting and informed SW that they are in agreement re: making pt CMO.  However, before informing the doctors, they will be talking with other family members this afternoon.  Family will likely be speaking with doctors this evening to inform them of decision for CMO.  Family have also agreed to attempt organ donation as pt has expressed in the past that he would like to donate his organs.  RN called NEOB who will be coming back to talk to the family this afternoon re: details.  SW to continue following.
