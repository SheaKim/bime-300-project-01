Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9781**] 
Chief Complaint:
mouth bleeding 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
85F with extensive medical history most notable for CVA with 
residual left hemiparesis, and PCV had 5 teeth pulled in upper 
gum on day prior to admission. She experienced persistent 
bleeding. She was reportedly seen by her dentist, who stated 
that the suture line was intact and there is no further 
intervention possible. Pt c/o swallowing blood but denies 
n/v/light-headedness.  
.  
In ED, her initial vitals were 97.6, 78, 121/66, 16, and 99% on 
RA. She remained hemodynamically stable throughout her time 
there. She did spike a temp to 100.8 at 11:30 pm on [**11-10**]. 
There, multiple attempts were made at stopping the bleeding; she 
had near-constant pressure, placement of gelfoam, vitamin K 5mg 
SC, 4 units of FFP, surgicel, afrin, silver nitrate, suture 
placed, and she received 2units of PRBC for a Hct drop of 42.4 
to 31.5. She was also agitated and was placed in restraints and 
given Haldol 2.5mg IV. She  
was also started on several antibiotics, including flagyl, 
unasyn, levoflox, clinda, ceftriaxone, [**12-30**] findings of UTI and 
possible aspiration PNA.  
.  
Concerning her persistent bleeding, Dental/OMFS was consulted 
and  
there was no response. ENT was consulted, but reported that 
there was no further intervention to be done other than 
correcting her coagulopathy.  
.  
She has not had any known history of bleeding disorder. ED and  
Heme/Onc have been in touch with her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 4557**] confirmed that she 
 
has not had any history of bleeding before. She was transferred 
to the FICU for management with Heme/Onc following.

Brief Hospital Course:
FICU Course:
.
No evidence of DIC or hemolysis (LDH (277 -> 421), bili (0.7), 
retic (2) haptoglobin (54 -> 71)). FDP 0-10, Fibrinogen 
190->283. Hct continued to slowly drop, requiring several 
additional transfusions of PRBC. Pt remained hemodynamically 
stable throughout. Smear w/o evidence of hemolysis except for 
rare schistos. Platelets normal. No evidence of liver disease on 
smear (no targets, etc). LFTs normal. Has no h/o liver disease 
or problems w/ synthetic function. No report of poor nutrition 
from [**Hospital **] Rehab records. No recent h/o heparin, coumadin, or 
other anticoagulants. ASA and hydrea held. continued 
allopurinol. 
.
Vitamin K SC initially given, then started on vitamin K 10mg IV 
qD x 3 days (started on [**11-12**]). Also given Amicar 4-5g IV bolus 
over one hour, followed by 1g/hr for 8hrs. Visible bleeding 
resolved on [**11-12**] and has not recurred since. 
.
Wbc count quite elevated throughout FICU course, up to 40. 
Possibly [**12-30**] infection (UTI or aspiration PNA) vs stress 
response from bleed, though by report, chronically elevated. Tx 
with levo (started [**11-11**]) and flagyl (started [**11-13**]) for 
possible aspiration PNA (10 day course). No evidence of 
progression to AML/MDS on smear.
. 
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 911**] also experienced hypernatremia to 150. Given D5W. She 
was kept NPO for first day in-house out of concern of gingival 
bleeding. Was started on liquid diet on [**11-13**]. 

She was transferred to the floor on [**11-13**], and continued to do 
well. She had no additional bleeding. Her hydrea and ASA were 
restarted. A mixing study was sent, with results pending at time 
of d/c. Received 3 days IV vitamin K, with slight improvement of 
her INR. INR should be f/u, and Vit K given as necessary. Hct 
should be checked periodically to ensure Ms. [**Known patient lastname 911**] has no 
additional bleeding.
.  
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 911**] also continued to be treated for pan-sensitive UTi and 
possible aspiration PNA. Blood cultures continued to be negative 
at time of D/c, and pt was C. diff negative. She is being 
discharged on Levo/Flagyl, and should continue this course until 
[**2990-11-22**].
.  
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 911**] had slight worsening of mental status, thought to be 
delerium [**12-30**] infection. Her psych meds were held, and foley 
catheter was d/c'ed.
 
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 911**] also had a few episodes of tachycardia on telemetry on 
[**11-15**], thought to be atrial tachycardia with variable block. Her 
VS were stable, and she was asymptomatic. She was started on 
metoprolol 12.5mg PO bid, and this arrhythmia has not recurred. 
A TTE was done that showed no regional WMAs, and preserved 
EF>75%.

Pt is DNR/DNI - discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], pt's PCP; also 
confirmed with daughter who is health care proxy.

     INDICATION:  85-year-old female with a history of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name 4424**], now with
     recent 20-point hematocrit drop.  Evaluate.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was performed without
     intravenous contrast.  No intravenous contrast was administered per protocol.
     Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH ORAL, WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Atelectasis and scarring
     is seen at both lung bases, without pleural effusions.  There are coronary
     artery calcifications and signs of anemia.  Imaging of the abdomen is limited
     by the lack of intravenous contrast.  Allowing for this, the liver is normal
     in attenuation.  An 8-mm calcification is seen within the right liver lobe.  A
     few calcified gallstones are seen within a non-distended gallbladder.  The
     pancreas is largely fatty replaced.  The spleen is enlarged measuring up to 15
     cm.  A 6-mm hypodensity within the posterior pole is inadequately
     characterized on this non-contrast study.  Both adrenal glands are full, and
     demonstrates CT characteristics consistent with adenomas.  The right adrenal
     gland appears normal.  Multiple foci of high and low attenuation are seen in
     both kidneys, which are too small to characterize.  A 3.5 x 3.8 cm cyst with
     rim calcifications extends off the inferior pole of the right kidney.  There
     is dense atherosclerosis involving the abdominal aorta, and proximal
     mesenteric branches.  The abdominal loops of large and small bowel are grossly
     unremarkable.  There is no intraabdominal, or retroperitoneal fluid to suggest
     hematoma.
     
     CT PELVIS WITHOUT ORAL, WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  A Foley catheter is
     seen within a collapsed bladder.  The sigmoid, rectum are unremarkable.  There
     is no inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.  There is no free air and no free
     fluid.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
     abnormalities.  Diffuse degenerative changes are seen throughout the lower
     thoracic and lumbar spine, with mild S-shaped scoliosis.
     
     Coronal and sagittal reformatted images confirm the axial findings.  MPR value

      85 year old woman with acute 20point Hct drop not completely explained by oral 
      mucosal bleeding after dentalprocedure.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please evaluate for retroperitoneal bleeding; also,please focus attention on 
      spleen - ? splenomegaly (h/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Doctor First Name 4424**])
     No contraindications for IV contrast

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  85-year-old female with a history of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name 4424**], now with
     recent 20-point hematocrit drop.  Evaluate.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was performed without
     intravenous contrast.  No intravenous contrast was administered per protocol.
     Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH ORAL, WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Atelectasis and scarring
     is seen at both lung bases, without pleural effusions.  There are coronary
     artery calcifications and signs of anemia.  Imaging of the abdomen is limited
     by the lack of intravenous contrast.  Allowing for this, the liver is normal
     in attenuation.  An 8-mm calcification is seen within the right liver lobe.  A
     few calcified gallstones are seen within a non-distended gallbladder.  The
     pancreas is largely fatty replaced.  The spleen is enlarged measuring up to 15
     cm.  A 6-mm hypodensity within the posterior pole is inadequately
     characterized on this non-contrast study.  Both adrenal glands are full, and
     demonstrates CT characteristics consistent with adenomas.  The right adrenal
     gland appears normal.  Multiple foci of high and low attenuation are seen in
     both kidneys, which are too small to characterize.  A 3.5 x 3.8 cm cyst with
     rim calcifications extends off the inferior pole of the right kidney.  There
     is dense atherosclerosis involving the abdominal aorta, and proximal
     mesenteric branches.  The abdominal loops of large and small bowel are grossly
     unremarkable.  There is no intraabdominal, or retroperitoneal fluid to suggest
     hematoma.
     
     CT PELVIS WITHOUT ORAL, WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  A Foley catheter is
     seen within a collapsed bladder.  The sigmoid, rectum are unremarkable.  There
     is no inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.  There is no free air and no free
     fluid.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
     abnormalities.  Diffuse degenerative changes are seen throughout the lower
     thoracic and lumbar spine, with mild S-shaped scoliosis.
     
     Coronal and sagittal reformatted images confirm the axial findings.  MPR value
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  Status post dental extraction with fever, gum swelling, and
     purulent drainage, evaluate for abscess or fluid collection.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained through the facial bones without
     intravenous contrast.  Additional coronal reformations are provided.
     
     CT OF THE FACIAL BONES WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There are multiple
     extractions sockets within the right maxillary alveolar ridge containing soft
     tissue density.  Periapical lucencies are noted within the maxillary alveolar
     ridge involving two left maxillary molars, which also demonstrate coronal
     lucencies.
     
     Periapical lucency is seen involving several mandibular incisors as well as a
     right posterior mandibular molar, also consistent with dental caries.
     
     There is mild asymmetric soft tissue swelling within the subcutaneous fat
     adjacent to the left maxilla without evidence of focal fluid collection. There
     is mild mural opacification of the maxillary sinuses bilaterally, slightly
     more prominent on the right, with a small air fluid level within the right
     maxillary sinus.  There is mild mural opacification of the ethmoid air cells
     bilaterally and mucosal thickening within the frontal sinuses.  The visualized
     portions of the mastoid air cells are normally pneumatized.  There are
     multiple subcentimeter submental lymph nodes not meeting criteria for
     pathologic enlargement.
     
     The visualized portion of the brain demonstrates hypodensity within the right
     MCA territory suggestive of prior infarct.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Multiple periapical lucencies involving left maxillary molars as well as
     right mandibular molar and mandibular incisors, findings that are suggestive
     of dental caries.  No evidence of drainable fluid collection to suggest
     abscess.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     STUDY:  85-year-old woman with recurrent pneumonia.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior study from [**2990-11-28**].
     
     Since the previous study, there has been no significant interval change. There
     is again seen prominence of the interstitial markings suggestive of mild
     pulmonary edema as well as bibasilar streaky opacities, suggestive of
     subsegmental atelectasis. Underlying infiltrates in these regions cannot be
     excluded.
