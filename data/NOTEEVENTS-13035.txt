History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 8438**] is a 61 y/o F with past medical history 
significant for cryptogenic cirrhosis on the transplant list 
with recent MELD 20 and type 2 DM who presents today due to 
worsening edema and hyponatremia after discontinuing her 
diuretics. The patient was recently seen in the Liver Center, at 
which time she was complaining of weight gain. Labs on [**2-26**] 
demonstrated creatinine 1.6 (baseline ~ 1) and sodium of 128. 
She discontinued her diuretics 2-3 weeks ago per her report. She 
had previously been taking 80 mg lasix daily and 200 mg 
spironolactone daily. She reports increased thirst which is 
constant throughout the day as well as decreased urine output. 
She endorses some dyspnea especially with lying flat; her family 
has noticed that her speech is softer in quality. She reports a 
temperature to 99.6 with some ""chills"" (per her family, though 
they point out slight tremor of the leg as an example). Her 
family believes she is at times more forgetful but is not 
currently confused.  
.  
She has been having [**3-9**] BMs per day but this has been more 
difficult for her. She tells us that she tried to get lactulose 
this week, but her pharmacy would not dispense it.  
.  
On review of systems, she denies recent congestion, abdominal 
pain, and headache. She does have a slight cough which is not 
productive. Her family noticed that her left arm was more 
swollen than the right several days ago; this has improved but 
persists.  
.  
Of note, the patient was recently discharged from the hospital 
after an evaluation of her left hip pain. MRI on that admission 
demonstrated normal hips with minor lower lumbar spine disc 
degenerative changes. Tramadol has helped this pain.  

 
Past Medical History:
* cryptogenic cirrhosis  
* History of biliary stricture  
* diabetes mellitus type 2  
* h/o hepatitis

* diabetic neuropathy  
* status post back surgery  
* status post cholecystectomy  
* status post foot surgery  
* Recent left hip pain without clear etiology  

 
Social History:
The patient lives with her husband who is ill. She has much 
support from her two sisters and her god-daughter. They provide 
care for over 12 hours per day at her home. History of alcohol 
use in the past but none recently. No tobacco/drug use.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 61F here with cirrhosis (Stage I varices) with a hospital 
course complicated by UGIB, renal failure and volume overload. 
Ultimately, the patient requested to be made CMO, and her health 
care proxy changed her code status to meet her wishes. All 
medications except morphine drip and ativan were discontinued. 
Prior to the change in code status, the following issues were 
addressed:
.  
# Hypotension - This was attributed to her chronic liver 
disease. She did appear septic at one point and her BP was 
maintained on pressors. Midodrine, octreotide, vasopressin and 
levophed were tried at different times to maintain her MAP>60 
and UOP>20cc/hr. Eventually, CVVH was initiated several times 
for volume overload and renal failure. Prior to death, the 
patient's mental status deteriorated and she appears to have GI 
blood loss. AT that point, the pressors were discontinued and 
the patient was made CMO.
.  
# Acute Renal Failure - The patient's creatinine increased 
steadily and was attributed to ATN vs. hepatorenal syndrome. She 
was treated for HRS with octreotide, midodrine and vasoopressin 
at one point. She was started on CVVHD for fluid overload. 
Levophed was used prn to maintain MAP>60 and UOP.
.
.  
#ANEMIA: Hematocrit stable. Initially thought related to prev 
UGIB. Has had guaiac positive stools now and appears to be 
bleeding from oral mucosa on [**4-12**]. Probably has uremic platelets 
as well as coagulopathy and decreased gastric perfusion  
-- ddAVP for uremic platelets.  
-- Will check serial hematocrits, with goal Hct > 24, will 
transfuse cautiously, given concerns for volume overload  
-- Continue to guaiac stools  
-- Continue bicarbonate  
-- Pressors to improve GI perfusion  
.  
# Fluid Overload - related to end-stage cryptogenic cirrhosis 
and renal failure. Initially improved with blood pressure 
control and CVVH. Hemodialysis line pulled for possible 
infection, cultures negative to date. Was intermittently on 
Bumex for diuresis; however, hold now. Pt has been maintained on 
levophed gtt restarted today, since patient dropping MAPs, so 
this may help with diuresis. A central line was placed to 
evaluate volume status. CVPs in the 20's suggesting against 
intravascular depletion.  
-- Goal net negative fluid balance with fluid restriction 
mainly, holding off on diuretics for now, can consider 
ethacrynic acid if alright with renal.  
--transfuse for HCT less than 24  
--appreciate renal and liver recs  
.  
# Mental status changes - Uremia vs. hyperammonemia vs. 
hypotension. Became more somnolent on [**3219-4-12**]. Arousable and 
answers questions.  
-- NPO  
-- Will restart pressors  
-- Check serum ammonia  
-- Consider CVVHD if ammonia WNL  
-- Increase lactulose if ammonia high and if not having brisk GI 
bleed.  
.  
# Cirrhosis: endstage cyptogenic cirrhosis w/grade I varices. 
MELD consistently > 30 and qualified for transplant as soon as 
can get her off of pressors.  
-- Considering TIPS procedure per hepatology  
-- Ursodiol  
-- lactulose (titrate to [**3-9**] BMs/day)  
-- f/u hepatology recs  
-- Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8439**] discussing possible transplant ON pressors 
w/surgical team, if [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need full cardiac w/u (ECHO, c/s 
re: hypotension)  
.  
# PNA/PLEURAL EFFUSIONS: CT chest that showed pneumonia, 
completed 8 day course of vancomycin/ciprofloxacin. [**3-27**] 
developed large pleural effusions, thoracentesis w/ 700cc off, 
negative cultures. However, developed recurrent O2 requirement 
due to volume overload.  
- Holding off on repeat thoracentesis for now, given small 
volume of pleural effusions.  
.  
# Thrombocytopenia - After initial marked drop with nadir of 
28,000, platelets now stable, HIT antibody negative x2. 
Serotonin release assay negative. Hem-onc c/s, w/u negative to 
date. Likely secondary to Zosyn reaction, as heparin SC was 
restarted without events. Now stabilized.  
.  
# Rash: Drug rash after initiation of Bumex, resolved 
spontaneously. Will avoid Bumex  
.  
# ABDOMINAL PAIN: Not an active issue. Pt initially complained 
of some RUQ abd pain. She is s/p chole and RUQ U/S negative. 
Started TF w/post-pyloric placement of tube. Pt states is 
relieved w/passing flatus or having BMs. Repeat LFT panel 
improving. Now no longer an active issue.  
--continue qday calorie counts  
--appreciate nutrition input  
.  
#. VAGINAL BLEEDING: Pt had episode of vaginal bleeding around 
[**3-24**]. Likely related to DUB from increased estrogen. Bimanual 
exam with some bleeding but no obvious masses/lesions. GYN 
consulted but TV u/s deferred until she is stable off pressors.  

--appreciate GYN recs  
.  
# Hyponatremia - due to liver disease and vasopressin, stable  
.  
# DM2: Initially on SSI and FS, however, had labile blood sugars 
and temporarily required insulin gtt. Daily insulin requirement 
varies (with nutritional status/feeding) and requires frequent 
adjustment of glargine regimen.  
--glargine at 50 Units Qday now that adequate po intake and tube 
feeds restarted  
.  
# FEN: Had post-pyloric FT placed but was pulled after adequate 
PO intake. Speech and swallow evaluation recommended advancing 
to regular diet. Temporarily did well with PO intake, and so 
tube feedings were discontinued, but had to be restarted on [**4-9**] 
as intake fell.  
-- Will change tube feeds to continuous and make NPO since 
mental status has deteriorated.  
--appreciate nutrition recs  
--encourage po intake as able  
--strict calorie counts  
.  
The patient's sisters and husband were at her bedside when she 
expired on [**4-14**]. An autopsy was denied by the family and the 
case was refused by the medical examiner.

      not responding to 3 units PRBCs, still bleeding - ulcer and clot seen on EGD in 
      1st segment of duodenum

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION FOR EXAM:  This is a 61-year-old woman with duodenal ulcer
     diagnosed on the EGD, history of cirrhosis that is having upper GI bleeding.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1230**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 397**], the
     attending radiologist who was present and supervising throughout the
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  After informed consent was obtained from the patient
     explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure, the patient was placed
     supine on the angiographic table and the right groin was prepped and draped in
     standard sterile fashion.  After injection of 5 cc of 1% lidocaine and the
     skin overlying the right common femoral artery, and using fluoroscopic
     guidance a 19-gauge needle was advanced into the right common femoral artery
     and a 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 193**] wire was advanced into the aorta under fluoroscopic
     guidance.  The needle was then exchanged for a 5 French vascular sheath and
     the C2 Cobra glide catheter was advanced over the wire up to the level of the
     T12 to engage the celiac trunk.  Injection of contrast demonstrates
     opacification of the GDA and left hepatic artery.  An angiogram was performed
     at this point demonstrating no signs of active extravasation of contrast into
     the vascular territory studied.  Then it was decided to catheterize distally
     the gastroduodenal artery using the combination of a glide catheter and a
     0.035 Glidewire.  After distal catheterization was achieved, an angiogram was
     performed demonstrating normal opacification of the distal part of the
     gastroduodenal artery with no areas of active extravasation of contrast. 
     Based on the clinical findings, it was decided to embolize the distal portion
     of the GDA with two coils of 5 mm for 3 cm that were placed in the distal
     portion of the GDA.  Then the catheter was removed and it was engaged into the
     superior mesenteric artery and injection of contrast demonstrates a large
     replaced right posterior hepatic artery.  The patient tolerated the procedure
     well.  The vascular sheath was removed and manual compression was applied for
     15 minutes until hemostasis was achieved.  There were no immediate
                                                                 (Over)

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      61 year old woman with duodenal ulcer on EGD, h/o cirrhosis, passing melena, 
      not responding to 3 units PRBCs, still bleeding - ulcer and clot seen on EGD in 
      1st segment of duodenum
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      pls eval for origin of bleed and intervene as appropriate                       
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION FOR EXAM:  This is a 61-year-old woman with duodenal ulcer
     diagnosed on the EGD, history of cirrhosis that is having upper GI bleeding.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1230**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 397**], the
     attending radiologist who was present and supervising throughout the
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  After informed consent was obtained from the patient
     explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure, the patient was placed
     supine on the angiographic table and the right groin was prepped and draped in
     standard sterile fashion.  After injection of 5 cc of 1% lidocaine and the
     skin overlying the right common femoral artery, and using fluoroscopic
     guidance a 19-gauge needle was advanced into the right common femoral artery
     and a 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 193**] wire was advanced into the aorta under fluoroscopic
     guidance.  The needle was then exchanged for a 5 French vascular sheath and
     the C2 Cobra glide catheter was advanced over the wire up to the level of the
     T12 to engage the celiac trunk.  Injection of contrast demonstrates
     opacification of the GDA and left hepatic artery.  An angiogram was performed
     at this point demonstrating no signs of active extravasation of contrast into
     the vascular territory studied.  Then it was decided to catheterize distally
     the gastroduodenal artery using the combination of a glide catheter and a
     0.035 Glidewire.  After distal catheterization was achieved, an angiogram was
     performed demonstrating normal opacification of the distal part of the
     gastroduodenal artery with no areas of active extravasation of contrast. 
     Based on the clinical findings, it was decided to embolize the distal portion
     of the GDA with two coils of 5 mm for 3 cm that were placed in the distal
     portion of the GDA.  Then the catheter was removed and it was engaged into the
     superior mesenteric artery and injection of contrast demonstrates a large
     replaced right posterior hepatic artery.  The patient tolerated the procedure
     well.  The vascular sheath was removed and manual compression was applied for
     15 minutes until hemostasis was achieved.  There were no immediate
                                                                 (Over)

     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1230**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 397**], the
     attending radiologist who was present and supervising throughout the
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  After informed consent was obtained from the patient
     explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure, the patient was placed
     supine on the angiographic table and the right groin was prepped and draped in
     standard sterile fashion.  After injection of 5 cc of 1% lidocaine and the
     skin overlying the right common femoral artery, and using fluoroscopic
     guidance a 19-gauge needle was advanced into the right common femoral artery
     and a 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 193**] wire was advanced into the aorta under fluoroscopic
     guidance.  The needle was then exchanged for a 5 French vascular sheath and
     the C2 Cobra glide catheter was advanced over the wire up to the level of the
     T12 to engage the celiac trunk.  Injection of contrast demonstrates
     opacification of the GDA and left hepatic artery.  An angiogram was performed
     at this point demonstrating no signs of active extravasation of contrast into
     the vascular territory studied.  Then it was decided to catheterize distally
     the gastroduodenal artery using the combination of a glide catheter and a
     0.035 Glidewire.  After distal catheterization was achieved, an angiogram was
     performed demonstrating normal opacification of the distal part of the
     gastroduodenal artery with no areas of active extravasation of contrast. 
     Based on the clinical findings, it was decided to embolize the distal portion
     of the GDA with two coils of 5 mm for 3 cm that were placed in the distal
     portion of the GDA.  Then the catheter was removed and it was engaged into the
     superior mesenteric artery and injection of contrast demonstrates a large
     replaced right posterior hepatic artery.  The patient tolerated the procedure
     well.  The vascular sheath was removed and manual compression was applied for
     15 minutes until hemostasis was achieved.  There were no immediate
                                                                 (Over)

Micu Acceptance Note

61 yo female with hx of cryptogenic cirrhosis, on transplant list with hx of esophageal varices presents from [**Hospital Ward Name **] 10 with GIB. Pt admitted to [**Hospital1 10**] on [**2-28**] with increased ascites, liver faiure and hyponatremia after discontinuation of her diuretics. Rx with albumin and lasix. Abd u/s showed patent hepatic vessels and sm ascites. On [**3-3**] hct fell from 27.7 to 25.3 and she was noted to have passed ~400ccs dk [**Last Name (un) 4348**] loose stool. No n/v or abd pain. Octreotide gtt initiated and pt transferred to MICU for endoscopy. Pt underwent endoscopy and received a total of 75 mcgs fentanyl iv and 1.5 mg versed iv. Endoscopy revealed no varices but a clot in the duodenum which was removed and the area adjacent injected with epin. Ulcer detected in the first part of the duodenum. 

Review of Systems - 

Neuro - Pt alert and oriented x 3. MAE. Follows commands. Slightly lethargic but easily arousable to verbal stimuli following sedation during procedure. Hx of hip pain of unknown etiology - pt denies pain presently, had been receiving tramadol on [**Hospital Ward Name **] 10, now ordered for mso4 prn. 

Resp - LS clear. RR 14-30. 02 sat fell to low 90s during endoscopy - 02 4 L nc applied and weaned down to 2 L nc with sats > 95%. Pt c/o feeling SOB when lying flat, RR increases to 30. No cough. 

C-V - HR 79-88 NSR. NBP 85-110/30-44 ( baseline SBP reportedly ~ 90). Weakly palp pedal pulses. 3+ pitting edema to thighs. LUE swollen - u/s reportedly neg for DVT.

GI - Abd + ascites. +BS. NPO. PO meds held. Passing flatus with melanotic odor but no stool. Vomited ~200ccs undigested food s/p endoscopy - rx with 12.5 mg anzimet iv with relief. Also rx with 10 mg reglan iv. Prtonix 80 mg bolus administered and drip infusing at 8mg/hr. Octreotide infusing at 50mcgs/hr. 

Heme - Hct 24 at 2000 - transfused one unit PRBCS without incident. Next hct sent ~ 1 hr post transfusion was 23.8. Goal hct > 28. MD aware, no transfusion at this time. To have serial hcts q 6hrs. If bleeding increases ? angio today. 

F/E - Pt with acute renal failure. Foley inserted, urine output 30-60ccs/hr. To be repleted with 40 meq kcl iv for K 3.8 yest. Hx hyponatremia - Na 130 yest. Am lytes to be sent. Diuresis on hold in setting of GIB. 

Endo - hx DM - RISS.

ID - Afeb. Cipro iv bid per GI

Access - Arrived with one # 22 angio R hand. IV RN inserted second #20 peripheral iv LL forearm. Multi-lumen RIJ inserted by MD - placement confirmed by x-ray but R side of neck needs to be observed for swelling as several attempts were made during line insertion. 

Social - Many friends visited. HCP notified of endoscopy and line insertion by MD via telephone.

Events-  Pt. did not have appropriate bump in HCT this am.  Therefore, transfused 2 additional units of PRBC.  Along w/ 2units of FFP for INR of 1.5.  IR also contacted at that time.  Pt. down to angiography this afternoon for coiling of bleeder near duodenum.  Pt. also had arterial line placed for better BP monitoring given pt. hypotensive to 70's.  

Review of Systems-

Neuro- intact.  Pleasant, cooperative. Pt. did not require conscious sedation during procedure.

Resp-  No issues, requiring NC 2L to maintain sat's 97-99%.  

CV/ hypotension-  Pt. required 2u PRBC and 2u FFP to increase BP to consistently > 80.  After receiving blood products CVP found to be 12, 14. Goal [**9-13**]. u/o maintained >50 throughout the shift.  

GI/ GIB-  As mentioned, pt. sent to angiography after 3 melanic stools this am and HCT drop.  Pt. will require frequent angio site checks (q30min X 2 hours) and pulse checks of right foot.  Pt. can bend right leg after 1030.  Will cont to check q4 hour HCTs as appropriate.  Next to be sent at 1800.  

GU-  Pt. draining marginal u/o.

ID-  Afebrile.  Conts on Cipro for SBP prophylaxis.  

Access-  Art line, Central line RIJ, 1 PIV

     COMPARISON:  Patient had a chest radiograph from [**3-18**].
     
     REPORT:
     The right subclavian and left internal jugular line in situ, one of which
     represents a Swan-Ganz catheter which is lodged in the proximal right
     pulmonary artery.  There is patchy airspace consolidation scattered throughout
     the pulmonary parenchyma, in a relatively non-dependent fashion being mostly
     located anteriorly.  Few bronchograms are also identified.  There is relative
     sparing of periphery.  Pleural effusion and atelectasis are also seen.  Some
     of the airspace consolidation appears quite focal, the appearances likely
     reflect patchy pneumonia superimposed on some background CCF.
     
     CT ABDOMEN:
     The NG tube appears in good position.  There is moderate cirrhosis.  Diffuse
     anasarca is present.  No ascites is present.  The examination is limited by
     lack of IV contrast, but no focal biliary dilatation is seen.  The gallbladder
     is not appreciated on the current examination.  The pancreas is little
     difficult to examine but it is unremarkable.  There is no significant
     splenomegaly.  The adrenals appear normal.  Both kidneys appear normal without
     evidence of mass, stones, or hydronephrosis.
     
     CT PELVIS:
     Patient is catheterized, air is identified in the urinary bladder.  Some
     uterine artery calcifications are seen.  There is no evidence of free air and
     contrast passes from the small bowel and to the proximal large bowel.  No
     obstruction is seen.
     
     CT BONES AND SOFT TISSUES:
     Few patchy foci of subcutaneous air identified along the left flank likely
     reflecting prior injection.  Please correlate for symptoms suggestive of
     aggressive cellulitis in this region.  No other suspicious lytic or sclerotic
                                                                 (Over)

     Displaced post-pyloric Dobbhoff tube.
     
     NASOINTESTINAL TUBE PLACEMENT:  The patient was placed supine on the
     fluoroscopic table.  The oropharynx was prepped with Hurricaine Spray and the
     right naris with lidocaine jelly.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, an 8-French
     20-cm [**Location (un) 43**]-[**Doctor First Name 44**] feeding tube was inserted into the right naris and
     advanced through the esophagus into the stomach.  The tube was then advanced
     through the pyloric valve into the proximal small bowel.  Injection of
     approximately 5 mL of Conray contrast demonstrates that the tip is located
     within the third portion of the duodenum.  The patient tolerated the procedure
     well without complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful nasointestinal tube placement with the tip within the
     third portion of the duodenum.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  61-year-old woman with pneumonia status post PICC line placement
     for antibiotics.
     
     Comparison is made to [**3219-3-25**].  There has been interval placement of
     a left-sided PIC line with the tip located in the right atrium or ventricle.
     Left IJ central line is in stable position in the mid SVC.  The right
     subclavian central line is unchanged.  A Dobhoff tube terminates near the
     ligament of Treitz. There are stable bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on
     the left and small on the right. Pulmonary edema appears improved. Bilateral
     airspace opacities with subtle air bronchograms correspond to pneumonic
     infiltrates better seen on CT of [**3219-3-19**].  A left lower lobe opacity
     likely represents atelectasis and/or additional consolidation.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  PICC line placement, tip in right atrium or ventricle.  Retraction of
     approximately 5-6 cm has been recommended and discussed with the IV nurse.
     
     2.  Slightly improved volume status. Otherwise, no significant interval change
     since [**3219-3-25**] with bilateral effusions, multifocal pneumonia and
     left lower lobe atelectasis and/or consolidation.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  61-year-old female with pneumonia, diuresed with CVVH.  Assess
     interval changes.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior radiograph dated [**3219-3-27**] and
     prior CT examination dated [**3219-11-16**].
     
     SINGLE SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
     
     There is stable appearance to a well-defined hazy opacity within left base
     dating back to [**3-22**], which does not appear to change with alteration in
     patient position.  It likely represents a effusion; however loculation cannot
     be excluded.  Right-sided pleural effusion is slightly improved as is mild
     pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac opacity, likely representing compression
     atelectasis is not significantly changed.  Dobbhoff tube tip is likely post-
     pyloric and left-sided PICC catheter and right-sided subclavian central venous
     line remain in appropriate anatomic positioning.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Well-defined hazy left lower lobe opacity which does not demonstrate
     change with alterations in patient position.  Recommend decubitus views for
     better evaluation.
     2.  Slightly decreased mild pulmonary edema.

     CLINICAL HISTORY:  61-year-old female, now status post left subclavian line
     placement.  Rule out pneumothorax.
     
     AP SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Compared to prior radiograph from [**3-30**], 2007, a left subclavian central venous catheter has been placed with tip
     overlying the expected region of the mid proximal SVC.  A left-sided PIC line
     is also present with tip overlying the expected region of the right atrium. No
     pneumothorax is identified.  The feeding tube has been removed.
     
     The moderate- sized left pleural effusion is unchanged.  A new small right
     effusion has developed.  There is diffuse moderate cardiogenic hydrostatic
     edema, worsened in comparison to the prior study.  The cardiomediastinal
     contour remains enlarged. There is a left retrocardiac opacity, which
     represents atelectasis versus airspace disease.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  New left subclavian central venous catheter in standard position.  A left
     PIC line is present with tip overlying the expected region of the right
     atrium.
     2.  Moderate hydroastatic edema with new small right and stable moderate-sized
     left pleural effusion secondary to cardiac decompensation.
     3.  Unchanged left retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis versus
     airspace disease.

     AP CHEST
     
     INDICATION:  Effusion.
     
     A single AP view of the chest is obtained [**3219-4-7**] at 16:20 hours and compared
     with the prior radiograph performed [**3219-4-4**].  Allowing for technical
     differences, there does not appear to have been any major change in the
     appearance of the bilateral pleural effusions, more marked on the left side. 
     Increased retrocardiac density on the left side likely represents superimposed
     atelectasis/airspace disease.  Two vascular catheters are present from the
     left side.  One of these has its tip overlying the proximal SVC.  The other
     appears to have its tip projecting over the right atrium, possibly IVC.

     INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and dependence on vasopressors.  Renal
     failure, cirrhosis.  Assess for pulmonary edema.
     
     COMPARISON:  Prior portable chest radiograph from [**3219-4-7**].
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  A portable chest radiograph was obtained in upright
     position in the frontal projection.
     
     Heart size appears stable as compared to two days ago.  There has been
     interval worsening in bilateral pleural effusion, mostly on the right side.
     Bilateral perihilar haziness and mild pulmonary edema appear worsened as
     compared to two days ago but remain relatively stable as compared to [**3219-4-4**].
     Again seen are two left-sided catheters, one corresponding to a left
     subclavian central venous catheter with its tip in the mid superior vena cava,
     and the other one corresponded to a left cephalic PICC line, with its tip not
     identified but probably at the level of the right atrium or possibly inferior
     vena cava.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Slightly worsened pleural effusion, mostly on the right side.
     Recurrent pulmonary edema, worsened as compared to two days ago but relatively
     similar to the appearance from [**3219-4-4**].
