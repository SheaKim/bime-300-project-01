      1.  Area of white matter edema, soft tissue mass, and acute on chronic
      hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe.
      2.  Smaller area of likely white matter edema and hemorrhage in the left
      frontoparietal lobe.
      3.  Areas of low attenuation adjacent to the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 548**] and in the left
      internal capsule and basal ganglia may be areas of lacunar infarction or edema
      from metastases.
      
      Assessment of interval change in hemorrhage cannot be made without prior
      studies.  MR [**First Name (Titles) 1191**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] would be more sensitive in assessing extent of
      metastatic disease.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  61-year-old man with known brain metastases and ""increasing
     bleeding"" from outside hospital, evaluate intracranial hemorrhage.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Within the right frontal lobe, there is a large
     area of low-attenuation within the white matter, consistent with vasogenic
     edema. Additionally, there are areas of increased attenuation (series 2, image
     23) and a larger area, which demonstrates layering of blood within a
     surrounding area of low attenuation, suggesting acute-on-chronic hemorrhage.
     There is associated sulcal effacement within the right frontal lobe,
     consistent with some associated mass effect.  Adjacent to this area, there is
     a prominent soft tissue component (series 2, image 18), which may correspond
     to one of the patient's known metastatic lesions.
     
     There are areas of low-attenuation adjacent to the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 548**] of the left
     lateral ventricle, which may represent areas of infarction or associated white
     matter edema.  No other definite focal mass lesions are identified.  Within
     the posterior right frontal lobe, (series 2, image 20), there is an area of
     low-attenuation with a tiny peripheral margin of increased density, which may
     represent another focus of more acute hemorrhage.  There is no shift of
     normally midline structures.  Basal cisterns are patent.  No definite areas of
     intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect identified within the temporal lobes or
     the posterior fossa, though there is limited evaluation due to streak
     artifact.
     
     There are post-surgical changes overlying the area of abnormality within the
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     right temporal region.  No soft tissue abnormality is seen.  No sclerotic or
     lytic osseous lesion is identified.  The visualized portions of the paranasal
     sinuses are well aerated.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  There are areas of low attenuation consistent with edema, predominantly
     within the right frontal lobe.  Additionally, there are areas of focal
     hemorrhage, some of which appears to be acute-on-chronic in that area, with
     probable soft tissue mass lesion as well.  There is a second area of low
     attenuation and probable hemorrhage within the left frontoparietal region.
     2.  Several areas of low attenuation adjacent to the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 548**], and
     within the left internal capsule and basal ganglia likely represent additional
     foci of vasogenic edema or, less likely, infarction.  No definite mass lesions
     are identified in these areas.
     3.  Obviously, ithout prior (outside) studies for comparison, the evolution of
     hemorrhage or edema cannot be assessed. Further characterization with enhanced
     MRI would be helpful in identifying the extent of metastatic disease, as well
     as associated edema and hemorrhage.

Chief Complaint:
seizure
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
whole brain radiation
 
History of Present Illness:
61yo man with metastatic melanoma, metastases to brain, and 
seizures related to this disorder presents with seizures at 
home. The history regarding his melanoma and seizures is listed 
below. Per the patient's family, he has had decline over past 
week - he has been talking less and less, when he does talk his 
voice is very soft and hoarse. He has had trouble swallowing his 
pills, and coughing when he drinks. He has persistent L arm and 
face weakness that has slowly worsened over time, though he can 
still walk around by himself (was walking the morning of 
admission). He had been having OCD-like symptoms on Keppra, 
which had been started for further seizure control as PHT had 
not been controlling the seizures. He saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] the day 
prior to admission, where Lamictal was started and keppra was 
discontinued. The morning of admission, the pt woke up ""very 
groggy."" He took the first dose of Lamictal 25 mg and his other 
morning meds. At 1:30pm, his wife witnessed a prolonged 
seizure-like episode lasting 20-25 minutes - with R hand shaking 
and L leg shaking. After the event, he vomited and was very 
sleepy. His wife called EMS; it is unclear if benzos were given. 
He was taken to [**Hospital6 3061**] where a head CT showed some 
""slightly"" increased edema and hemorrhage at the site of a known 
hemorrhagic met in the R frontal [**Last Name (LF) 8381**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was transferred 
here. 
He has been sleepy and not saying much since the event; he has 
persistent L arm and face weakness. On ROS, his wife and sister 
do not think he has had fever; he has had HAs recently but did 
not think he had HA today; no coughing, no GI/GU complaints, no 
respiratory complaints except coughing when he eats or drinks 
sometimes.
 
Past Medical History:
-Melanoma Hx:
-- had moles removed few years ago, stage II melanoma, s/p
resection with ""clean margins"" thought cured, no chemo
-- presented this year with slight L facial droop, diagnosed 
with
metastatic melanoma, mets to brain discovered
-- s/p craniotomy with resection R frontal lesion, still had
deeper, contralat lesions
-- s/p gamma knife at RIH/Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8382**] for other lesions
-- Hemorrhage in met [**7-28**] had p/w difficulty talking;
hospitalized, had PNA and DVTs (wife denies PE, but Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 8383**] notes detail that he did have PE); s/p filter in 
each
leg (one clotted off)
-- Mesenteric mass [**9-19**] with bx consistent with melanoma
-- Seizures started [**9-3**] - GTC 3-5 minutes, on PHT; subsequent 
sz
associated with low PHT levels, several hospitalizations at [**Hospital3 8180**] for this; had been started on Keppra
-- On decadron since [**10-28**] again after another seizure
-- Was taken off Keppra [**10-3**] after obsessive-compulsive sx noted
by family, saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for first time, Lamictal started

Other PMH:
-HTN
-Anemia
-Depression
-High cholesterol (recently off meds for this)
-kidney stones
 
Social History:
Lives with wife, taking medical leave from work - respiratory 
therapist at [**Hospital6 3061**]. Quit tobacco this year, 
formerly smoked ""whole life.""  No etoh, no drugs. Pt has no 
living will/advanced directive, has discussed with wife that he 
would not want to be on vent for long period of time, but is 
full code for now.
 
Family History:
Mother had [**Name2 (NI) 2256**] ca; no other ca, no seizures, no neuro d/o's; 
father had MI.
 
Physical Exam:
Admission exam:
T 99.9  HR 100  BP 119/75  RR 22  100%RA
General appearance: lethargic, sweaty, white male
HEENT: mildly dry mucus membranes
Neck: supple, no bruits
Heart: regular rate and rhythm, no obvious murmurs
Lungs: diminished to auscultation bilaterally
Abdomen: soft, nontender +bs
Extremities: warm, well-perfused

Mental Status: The patient keeps eyes closed for most of exam, 
opens eyes spontaneously at end of interview - says ""I have to 
use the bathroom"" - voice very soft and slightly hoarse.  
Appears very lethargic, and while examiner is talking to his 
wife and sister, pt falls asleep, starts snoring.  Easily 
arousable from [**Doctor Last Name 292**] state.  O/w no speech heard for entirity of 
exam; follows commands to provide resistance, squeeze hands, but 
does not follow all commands, and at times seems less attentive, 
have to ask pt questions several times before he performs task.  


Cranial Nerves: The visual fields are full. The optic discs 
could not be visualized due to pupil size. Eye movements normal 
with OCR, but pt had R gaze preference, eyes usually midline to 
R, no nystagmus.  Pupils react equally to light, both directly 
and consensually. Bilaterally brisk corneals.  Facial movements 
are significant for L facial droop (UMN). Hearing is intact to 
voice. Tongue and palate appear midline.

Motor System: There is nl tone throughout, nl bulk. Pt 
participates on command with most of strength exam as follows: 
RUE: [**5-2**] at delt, [**Hospital1 **], tri, wrist and finger ext, and finger flex 
RLE: [**5-2**] at IP, ham, quad, foot plantarflex, dorsiflex. LUE: 
antigravity with some resistance at delt and [**Hospital1 **] (?4-/5), [**3-2**] 
finger flexors, trace mvmt ([**2-2**]) of triceps and finger ext. LLE: 
[**4-2**] at IP, full at quad, full plantarflex, did not participate 
further.
No tremor, could not assess drift due to pt's participation.

Reflexes: The tendon reflexes are brisk and symmetric 
throughout, with no clonus or crossed adductors; both toes are 
upgoing.  

Sensory: withdraws more vigorously on R side than left side, but 
cannot assess sensation more fully at this time due to pt's 
fatigue.

Coordination and Gait: Could not be assessed.

Imaging
CT [**11-4**]:
3x3.5 cm right frontal metastasis surrounded by vasogenic edema, 
more extensive when compared with MRI [**10-3**]. 2mm shift. Multiple 
other mets as noted on previous scans. 
.
[**11-7**] - video s/s eval - IMPRESSION: Aspiration of thin 
consistency. For further recommendations, please consult the 
speech pathology note available on CareWeb.
.
[**11-7**] CT abd/pelvis - 
1. Large mass arising from the body of the pancreas with atrophy 
of the pancreatic tail. There is an adjacent large lobulated 
mass, which likely represents consolidative lymphadenopathy. 
These findings are most consistent with metastatic melanoma. A 
primary pancreatic neoplasm is less likely.
2. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
.
[**11-6**] - CXR -IMPRESSION: Bibasilar atelectasis. No evidence of 
pneumonia.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
61yo man with metastatic melanoma with metastases to brain, 
presented with likely seizure and was transferred here when OSH 
scan showed slight increase in edema and hemorrhage right 
frontal known lesion, and new left insular lesion. On exam, he 
was very lethargic, with otherwise worsening of baseline 
deficits (weakness on L, relative aphasia) which could be 
persistent postictal state versus mental status changes from 
increased edema associated with metastasis, versus underlying 
infection. 

Hospital course is reviewed below by problem:

1. seizure: likely secondary to his metastasis and increasing 
edema/hemorrhage. He was continued on dilantin with goal level > 
20. Lamictal was also continued at his home dose (recently 
started). He was started on a low dose of ativan three times a 
day. And treated for infection (see below).  Patient remained 
seizure free thereafter.  He was continued on dilantin 300 mg, 
300 mg, 200 mg.  Lamictal 50 bid. increasing dose qmonday, 
should be monitored for drug rash.  Continue ativan 0.5mg tid.

2. brain metastasis w/ edema: Given the increase in edema, he 
was put on a higher dose of decadron. He was initially admitted 
to the ICU, and transferred out of the unit when he remained 
stable. He was then transferred to the neurooncology service and 
underwent whole brain XRT. Neurosurgery saw him prior to the XRT 
and determined that he did not need surgical intervention prior 
to the radiation.  He received XRT, total 5 treatments and was 
monitored on a medicine floor during this time and his mental 
status continued to improve.  He will continue decadron with a 
taper and bactrim prophy while on decardron.

3. Melanoma - per [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8128**] [**Doctor Last Name **] no planned chemo for atleast 1 
month after radiation.

4. ID: Patient febrile and had leucocytosis with bandemia on 
admission so in setting 
of seizures was started on zosyn.  2/2 blood cx. positive for 
pseudomonas, pan sensitive.  source unclear, as urine cx., CXR 
negative.  switched to levofloxacin [**11-7**], afebrile since.  
Follow up surveillance cx. negative. Continue levoflox for 14 
day course (started [**3310-11-5**]).

5. Elevated amylase, lipase: nl on admit, no abdominal pain, 
with elevated amylase after radiation, quickly trended down.  ? 
acute parotitis with hyperamylesemia following WBXRT.  Abd. CT 
with pancreatic mass, GI consulted and felt that as has nl. 
clinical exam unlikely acute pancreatitis. Continued artificial 
saliva PRN.

     INDICATION:  History of metastatic melanoma.  Evaluate for aspiration.
     
     VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW:  The study was performed in conjunction with the
     speech pathology staff.  Fluoroscopic guidance was provided while various
     consistencies of barium were administered.  Aspiration with thin consistency
     was noted.  There was prolonged chewing of solids that had to be washed down
     with thin consistency to be cleared from the oropharynx.  There is no
     aspiration with nectar consistency.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Aspiration of thin consistency.  For further recommendations,
     please consult the speech pathology note available on CareWeb.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  61-year-old man with elevated amylase.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained
     without and with IV contrast.  100 cc Optiray.  Oral contrast was also
     administered.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
     
     CT ABDOMEN:  There is mild dependent atelectasis.  No focal hepatic lesions
     are identified.  Decreased attenuation along the falciform ligament is likely
     related to fatty replacement.  Stones are noted in the nondistended
     gallbladder.  There is a 4.1 x 3.2 cm mass within the body of the pancreas.
     The distal pancreas is atrophic.  Superior to this is an adjacent 6.2 x 5.5 cm
     lobulated mass.  The adrenal glands, kidneys, stomach, and bowel loops are
     unremarkable.  There are bilateral renal cysts and additional low attenuation
     foci which may represent cysts but are too small to be fully characterized.
     There is no free air or free fluid.  An IVC filter is noted.
     
     CT PELVIS:  Foley catheter and air are noted in the bladder.  The prostate,
     seminal vesicles, sigmoid colon, and rectum are unremarkable.  There is no
     free fluid and no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Large mass arising from the body of the pancreas with atrophy of the
     pancreatic tail.  There is an adjacent large lobulated mass, which likely
     represents consolidative lymphadenopathy.  These findings are most consistent
     with metastatic melanoma.  A primary pancreatic neoplasm is less likely.
     
     2.  Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.

     INDICATION:  61-year-old patient with a history of melanoma and brain
     metastases.  Status post whole brain radiation therapy on [**11-13**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a large right frontal lobe enhancing metastasis measuring
     3.2 x 3 cm with a large amount of adjacent vasogenic edema.  There is mild
     mass effect upon the ipsilateral and lateral ventricle.  There is a 1.2 x 0.7
     cm enhancing metastatic lesion within the left-sided postcentral gyrus.  An
     additional enhancing 2 x 2.1 cm lesion is noted in the left caudate head
     involving the anterior limb of the internal capsule.  There is a small right-
     sided temporal craniotomy with some increased T1 signal just deep to it. It is
     uncertain whether there is any enhancement in this area or whether these are
     related to blood products from a prior biopsy perhaps.  No additional lesions
     are identified.  There are mild amounts of adjacent vasogenic edema in the
     left cerebral hemispheric mets.
     
     IMPRESSION:  A large right frontal intracranial metastasis present with a
     large amount of adjacent vasogenic edema.
     
     Two smaller metastatic lesions are noted in the left cerebral hemisphere with
     only mild adjacent vasogenic edema.  No prior MRIs are available for
     comparison.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      61 year old man with metastatic melanoma baseline scan prior to starting 
      Temodar
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      ? evidence of disease progression

     CT TORSO
     
     INDICATION:  61-year-old man with metastatic melanoma.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3310-11-7**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images through the abdomen without intravenous contrast
     were obtained.  Following intravenous contrast administration, images of the
     chest, abdomen, and pelvis and delayed images at the level of the kidneys were
     also obtained.
     
     Coronal and sagittal reconstructed images were displayed.
     
     CT CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The lungs are clear.  Atelectatic changes
     in the dependent portions are noted.  The airways are patient to the
     subsegmental bronchi, bilaterally.  The heart and great vessels are stable. No
     evidence of pericardial or pleural effusions.  No evidence of mediastinal,
     hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy.  Port-A-Cath is noted in the right chest.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen,
     and adrenal glands are stable.  There is a lobulated mass in the celiac axis
     which has increased in size since prior examination.  The mass previously
     measured 6.2 x 5.5 cm and today measures 6.5 x 6.1 cm.  The mass extends into
     the lesser sac and is abutting the body of the pancreas.  The kidneys
     demonstrate symmetrical enhancement without evidence of hydronephrosis.  There
     are multiple hypodense lesions within the renal cortex, bilaterally, and
     stable since prior examination.  An IVC filter is again noted.  The
     gallbladder demonstrates multiple gallstones.  No evidence of acute
     cholecystitis.  No evidence of free air or free fluid within the abdomen.  The
     visualized loops of large and small bowel are unremarkable.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS:  The rectum, sigmoid, bladder, and distal ureters are
     stable.  The prostate and seminal vesicles are unremarkable.  No evidence of
     free fluid within the pelvis.  No evidence of pelvic or inguinal
     lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Interval slight increase in size in the lobulated mass in the celiac axis
                                                                 (Over)
