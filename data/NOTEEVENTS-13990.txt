Reason: UNRESPONSIVE. ? ICH

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
75 year old woman with unresponsiveness 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for ICH 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: creat

INDICATION: Unresponsiveness.

NONCONTRAST HEAD CT: No prior for comparison. Patient is 
markedly tilted within the scanner gantry.

FINDINGS: No hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline 
structures, intra- or extra- axial hemorrhage, or acute major 
vascular territorial infarct is identified. Lacunar infarcts, 
chronic in age, are noted in both basal ganglia and subinsular 
cortices reflects chronic microvascular infarction. A few subcm. 
areas of low density are noted in the right temporal lobe- these 
may represent enlarged sulci v. chronic cortical infarcts.

The patient is intubated. No fractures are seen. There is a 
small, probable retention cyst in the right maxillary sinus, 
with opacification of a few ethmoid air cells, and mild mucosal 
thickening in the frontal sinus. Mastoid air cells are poorly 
pneumatized and aerated. Sphenoid sinus shows moderate mucosal 
thickening. There is fluid and aerosolized secretions in the 
nasopharynx and oropharynx, likely due to intubation.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. See 
above report for additional findings.

Sinusitis, likely chronic in age.

GI BLEEDING STUDY  [**2511-9-27**] 

GI BLEEDING STUDY

Reason: BRBPR AND RLQ PAIN ? SOURCE OF BLEED

RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA:
16.4 mCi Tc-99m RBC ([**2511-9-27**]);
HISTORY: Recent bright red blood per rectum, in the setting of 
sepsis and 
multiorgan failure in the MICU. 

DECISION: 

INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous 
red blood cells
labeled with Tc-99m, blood flow and dynamic images of the 
abdomen for minutes
were obtained. A left lateral view of the pelvis was also 
obtained. 

Blood flow images are unremarkable. The iliac arteries are 
ectactic. 

Dynamic blood pool images show no definite early bleeding on 
images obtained
over 0-60 minutes. Subsequently, after repositioning the patient 
over a [**9-13**]
minute period, imaging shows evidence of hemorrhage in the 
sigmoid colon over
the subsequent hour. 

IMPRESSION: Late dynamic images demonstrating extravasation into 
the sigmoid
colon, but no evidence of brisk bleeding within the first hour. 
This is most
suggestive of a slow intermittent hemorrhage in the sigmoid 
colon. These
findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] from the MICU shortly 
after the study.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Respiratory failure.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Respiratory failure.

OPERATION:  Percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement.

INDICATION:  Nutrition.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After informed consent was
obtained, under general anesthesia, and with the patient
already on Zosyn for antibiotic prophylaxis, she was placed
at a 45 degrees angle. The gastroscope was inserted into the
oral cavity and passed through the esophagus into the
stomach. The mucosa was entirely normal with no obvious
lesion. The stoma was insufflated. The skin over the left
upper quadrant was palpated and a sharp indentation with 1
finger was seen. The skin was prepped with chlorhexidine and
draped in a typical sterile fashion. 1% lidocaine was used
for local anesthesia. An Angiocath was inserted under direct
vision and a snare was lassoed and pulled back through the
esophagus and into the oral cavity. A 20-French PEG tube was
loaded and pulled back through the oral cavity into the
esophagus and through the abdominal wall. The gastroscope was
reinserted to confirm excellent placement with a mushroom cap
against the abdominal wall cavity. Bolsters were placed at 3
cm to secure the PEG tube.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Respiratory failure.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Respiratory failure.

PROCEDURE:  Percutaneous tracheostomy tube placement.

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  Respiratory failure.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After informed consent was
obtained, under general anesthesia, the patient's neck was
prepped with chlorhexidine, draped in the usual fashion.  The
first tracheal ring was identified.  Local anesthesia using
1.5 Xylocaine with epinephrine was used to anesthetize the
area. A 2 cm horizontal skin incision was performed using a
scalpel. Using [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 874**] clamp we dissected the subcutaneous
tissue until visualizing the tracheal rings. The 18 gauge
needle with an attached syringe with lidocaine in the trachea
was penetrated under bronchoscopic visualization. A guidewire
was inserted through the needle, after which the needle was
withdrawn. A punch dilator was inserted and using a blue
Rhino kit, the trachea was dilated, after which an 8 Portex
tracheostomy tube was inserted. The bronchoscope was
introduced through the tracheostomy tube and midline position
was confirmed with adequate volumes on mechanical ventilator.
The tracheostomy tube was connected to the ventilator and was
secured to the neck with a Velcro skin tie.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 y/o female with PMH breast ca s/p R sided mastectomy, 
interstitial lung disease, h/o pna, presented w/ 1 week h/o 
cough, was intubated at [**Hospital3 **], and transferred to 
[**Hospital1 19**] at family's request, septic with hypothermia, hypotensive 
on pressors, and with shock liver and renal failure.
.
# Respiratory Failure:  She was intubated at [**Hospital3 1141**] for 
hypoxic respiratory failure.  Her CT scan suggests interstitial 
lung disease. ECHO showed normal ejection fractio. She was 
intubated from admission on [**2511-9-16**], and had a tracheostomy 
placed on [**2511-9-29**].  Susupected cause for decompensation was 
underlying pneumonia . Sputum cultures  were negative. Viral 
Bronchoalveolar lavage showed no increase number of macrophages 
or eosinophils. She completed a 14 day course of Vancomycin and 
Zosyn for empiric pneumonia.  Prednisone  1 mg/kg was given for 
treatment of possible cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Patient 
became progressively more hypercapnic and had a respiratory 
acidosis soon after trying to wean from Assist /Control 
Mechanical Ventilation and   placed on PS ventilation. For this 
reason, a tracheostomy tube was placed on [**2511-9-29**] (day # 14 of 
intubation) with no complications. She tolerated BIPAP with 
optimal titration parameters between 15/5 cmH2O.  She should 
continue Prednisone 1 mg/kg for 4 weeks and her outpatient 
Pulmonologist should taper Prednisone to 0.5 mg/kg after this 
period to continue for at least 6-8 weeks total. She will need 
Mechanical Ventilation at rehab facility. 
Current vent settings are BiPAP with pressure support of 10 and 
PEEP of 5 with .40 FiO2.
.
# Sepsis: She presented with hypotension, hypothermia (T 95.0 on 
admission), leukocytosis with bandemia, end-organ failure (shock 
liver c AST/ALT > 11000, ARF).  Initially required pressors (on 
levophed which were discontinued within 24 hours. Likely 
etiologies included infectious- PNA considering UA was not 
abnormal and a CT scan of the abdomen done at an OSH did not 
show abscess , diverticulitis, perforation, mesenteric ischemia. 
 She was given broad spectrum antibiotics vancomycin and zosyn 
to cover infectious etiologies. Urine, sputum, and blood 
cultures did not grow out any organisms. She completed a 14 day 
course of antibiotics on [**2511-9-30**]. 
.
# Leukocytosis/C Diff Infection: Patient had an elevated WBC 
count of 12 K c 10 % bands on admission . She received full 
course of broad spectrum atb. After D # 4 of admission WBC 
peaked at 29000 despite atb treatment.  Two C diff toxin A were 
negative but a second C diff toxin B came back positive.  She 
was started on Flagyl [**2511-9-20**] and should complete a 14 day 
course on [**2511-10-3**].
.
# ARF: She has no history of underlying renal disease.  She 
presented with elevated Cr of 3 which peaked to 7 during 
admission. UA showed muddy brown casts. Urine lytes c/w ATN. US 
showed normal sized kidneys  SHe had oliguria which resolved 
with time and her urine output is back to baseline. She had also 
received Gentamycin and contrast at the outside hosptial, which 
may have contributed.  There was no need for dialysis. 
Creatinine was 3.6 on discharge , with normal Urine output. She 
should continue on phosphate binders until renal function 
returns to baseline.
.
# Altered mental status: Presented intubated, non-responsive. 
Likely Toxic/metabolic (renal failure with uremia, hepatic 
encephalopathy, infectious) vs Medication effect given renal 
failure and transaminitis as she received sedating medications 
at OSH. She regained responsiveness and was alert and oriented 
throughout most of her admission. 
.
# Elevated Amylase/Lipase: Amylase/lipase trending up after tube 
feeds initiated. Enxymes came back to normal after improvement 
of renal function.
.
# Transaminitis: Presented with highly elevated LFT's, Bili, 
LDH. Likely due to shock liver. Acetamenophen level not 
elevated. Hepatitis serologies, EBV, CMV negative for acute 
infection.  No evidence of portal vein or hepatic vein 
thrombosis on U/S. Anti-SM Ab positive. Enzymes trended down to 
normal on discharge.
.
# Metabolic Acidosis: Patient had elevated anion gap on 
admission . AFter fluid resuscitation her metabolic acidosis 
turned was worsened by  respiratory acidosis. Both improved 
after treatment of sepsis and lung infection.
.
# Diverticular Bleed: Patient had massive hematochezia on HD # 
11. Hc remained stable near 28-32 %.EGD wnl. Lower GI scope with 
diverticulosis and evidence of earlier bleeding. She received 2 
U PRBC. HCT remained stable during rest of hospitalization.
She should avoid NSAIDs and aspirin. High fiber diet 
recommended. 
.
# NSTEMI:  Pt w/out known h/o cardiac disease.  Had demand 
ischemia in setting of sepsis, with elevated trop due to renal 
failure. Echo showed EF 50% with large LA and diated RV with Mod 
TR and Significant PR, PAP 33. ASA was started due to 
coagulopathy on admission and later GI bleed. May start ASA in 
th future if no further episodes of bleeding. 
.
# Bradycardia: Patient's HR ranged from 40 -60 after sepsis 
treated. Patient was never symptomatic. EKG without conduction 
abnormalities.
.
# Anemia: Normocytic. Iron studies show elevated iron and 
ferritin levels, low TIBC.
.
# Nutrition:  She has a PEG placed on [**2511-9-29**]. She should get

     SINGLE VIEW CHEST:  No prior for comparison.  Diffuse patchy opacities
     throughout both lungs without significant pleural effusions.  Cardiac,
     mediastinal, and hilar borders not well evaluated due to diffuse opacities.
     Endotracheal tube should be withdrawn approximately a centimeter for optimal
     position.  Right internal jugular vein line crosses the midline and probably
     terminates in the left brachiocephalic vein.  Nasogastric tube is seen
     coursing below the diaphragm.  Degenerative changes of the glenohumeral joint.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Diffuse severe patchy airspace opacities representing ARDS,
     atypical pneumonia, lymphangiitic carcinomatosis or multiple other etiologies.
     Clinical context should help narrow the differential diagnosis.  Element of
     superimposed edema suspected.

     HISTORY:  Sepsis and pneumonia.  Post-right subclavian central venous catheter
     line placement.
     
     COMPARISON:  Earlier same day.
     
     FINDINGS:  Consistent with the prior exam, the previously noted right internal
     jugular approach line has been removed.  A right subclavian approach central
     venous catheter is now present with the tip projecting in the region of the
     right atrium-superior vena cava junction.  In addition, the endotracheal tube
     has been retracted to approximately 2.5 cm, in appropriate position.
     Nasogastric tube is again identified with the side hole within the gastric
     fundus.  Extensive diffuse bilateral reticular nodular interstitial opacities
     are again identified.  Additional history helps narrow the previously offered
     differential diagnosis as likely diffuse atypical pneumonia.  The radiograph
     is otherwise stable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  New right subclavian central line after removal of right internal
     jugular central line.  No pneumothorax.  Extensive parenchymal disease as
     described above likely secondary to atypical pneumonia, consider mycoplasma as
     a potential etiology.

     NONCONTRAST HEAD CT:  No prior for comparison. Patient is markedly tilted
     within the scanner gantry.
     
     FINDINGS: No hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, intra- or
     extra- axial hemorrhage, or acute major vascular territorial infarct is
     identified. Lacunar infarcts, chronic in age, are noted in both basal ganglia
     and subinsular cortices reflects chronic microvascular infarction. A few
     subcm. areas of low density are noted in the right temporal lobe- these may
     represent enlarged sulci v. chronic cortical infarcts.
     
     The patient is intubated. No fractures are seen. There is a small, probable
     retention cyst in the right maxillary sinus, with opacification of a few
     ethmoid  air cells, and mild mucosal thickening in the frontal sinus. Mastoid
     air cells are poorly pneumatized and aerated. Sphenoid sinus shows moderate
     mucosal thickening. There is fluid and aerosolized secretions in the
     nasopharynx and oropharynx, likely due to intubation.

     HISTORY:  75-year-old woman with sepsis, now with pancreatitis.
     
     ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND STUDY:  Comparison was made to recent prior study of
     [**2511-9-16**].  Examination was done portably.  The gallbladder is not
     visualized.  The liver is of normal echogenicity, and there are no focal
     lesions seen.  The main portal vein is patent.  The pancreatic head and body
     are well visualized.  The pancreatic tail is not well visualized secondary to
     patient body habitus and overlying bowel gas.  No peripancreatic fluid
     collections are seen.  The common bile duct measures 1.2-1.3 cm in size.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No peripancreatic fluid collections or definite pancreatic ductal
     dilatation.  Ultrasound is not a very specific test to assess for acute
     pancreatitis.  If there is continued clinical concern for this diagnosis, a
     dedicated CT study could be performed.
     
     2.  Common bile duct size as described above, relatively unchanged from recent
     prior study.  Gallbladder nonvisualized.  Raises the possibility of prior
     cholecystectomy.

     AP PORTABLE CHEST, [**2511-9-20**] AT 10:35 A.M.
     
     HISTORY:  Sepsis and pneumonia.
     
     COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated [**2511-9-19**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are mildly diminished.  This likely results in
     relative coalescing of the previously noted extensive bilateral pulmonary
     opacities.  However, superimposed edema cannot be excluded.  Support tubes and
     lines remain stable.  No effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Slightly increased opacity and confluence of the previously noted
     extensive bilateral pulmonary opacities.  Review of the patient's Radiology
     jacket reveals prior history of pulmonary fibrosis.  If true, this likely
     represents a combination of an acute superimposed edema like process on the
     background of extensive pulmonary fibrosis.

Pt. remains intubated on ventilatory support. A.M. RSBI 112.  Pt remains very congested, suction for copious amounts of secretions ranging from thick to tenacious. Pt. becomes agitated and attempts to pull out ETT and OG tubes. Pt appears lucid and aware of what she is doing, stated to this therapist that she is frightened and is uncomfortable (with the tubes and being restrained). This therapist explained why she is intubated, restrained and being suctioned so frequently. Pt. appears to understand and calms somewhat after reassurances but this therapist again caught pt. bending her head and torso down toward her restrained hand attempting to extubate herself.

Mrs [**Known patient lastname 1796**] cont to make slow progress.

Resp:pt was weaned to PSV of 5/5 she did well with RR of 18-24 and TV of 350-400cc. She had O2 sats of >97%. She cont to have a mod amt of thick secretions require sx q2-4hrs. She looked comf on vent but her ABG showed her to bee increasingly acidotic again. Her renal function is slow to return. So she will remain intubated overnight and be reevaluated in the am. She was placed back on A/C for now. 

Neuro:pt was taken off fentanyl after her pedi tube was placed. she is awake and interactive with her family. she will not always particiupate in her care and she still tries to refuses things like:mouth care and turning. She will follow simple commands.

GI: pt had post pyloric pedi tube placed under fluro without incident.
she hasno asp and cont to pass liq stool. 2nd stool spec sent for c.diff. she cont on flagyl. her TF have been restarted after the decision was mad enot to extubate her.

GU: pt renal function is about the sme with BUN/CR of 108/7. She is about equal sl neg but the renal team wants to allow pt to auto diures on her own. CXR still suggest she is vol overloaded.

CV: pt has been maintaining BP on her own 100-130's/ 70's, her Hr has been in the 80's 

ID:pt is afebrile but WBC ct is still up at 28.she will cont on x3 IVAB and vanco level is pnd

Social:family meeting with pt's son and x2 daughters. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] explained plan that if she was ready to be extubated than we would. He also asked about what their mom would want if they had to reintubate her and how she would feel about long term care/trach in the event that she failed her extubation. All agreed that the pt would not want to be in long term care or have a trach.  There is now one daughter that does not  agree with this. They were reassured by nsg that the medical team would cont to talk daily about her care and that they need to keep in mind what the pt  really wants.

a/P:Will rest overnight and cont with aggressive pulm. re evaluate ability to be extubated in the am.
    Follow vanco levels and 
    Follow stool amt and send 3rd stool spec tomorrow.
    Follow renal fucntion and watch for autodiuresis

     An overlay of mild pulmonary edema has recurred since [**9-22**].  Severe
     generalized interstitial pulmonary abnormality could be fibrosis or
     disseminated metastases.  There is the suggestion of a 2.5 cm wide oval
     opacity in the left upper lobe projecting over the first anterior rib, which
     could be a mycetoma in a cavity or ectatic bronchus, probably not contributory
     to the patient's current clinical situation.

     REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Hypoxic respiratory failure, acidosis, suspected
     chronic lung disease.
     
     COMPARISON:  Serial chest x-rays from [**9-18**] till [**2511-9-23**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT of the chest without injection of IV contrast [**Doctor Last Name 116**] from
     thoracic inlet to upper abdomen was obtained with subsequent 1.25- and 5-mm
     collimation axial images reviewed as well as coronal reconstructions added.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     The patient has been intubated with the tip of the ET tube 2.5 cm above the
     carina.  The NG tube terminates within the stomach.  The aorta and the
     pulmonary arteries are unremarkable within the limitation of this unenhanced
     study.  Multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes are present in the right
     paratracheal, supracarinal, subcarinal, aortopulmonic, and prevascular areas
     measuring up to 1.5 cm in the right paratracheal station.  The heart size is
     normal.  Coronary calcifications involve all the coronary arteries.  The heart
     size is mildly enlarged, and there is no pericardial effusion.
     
     The airways are patent to the level of segmental bronchi.  Widespread
     bilateral areas of intersttial density consitent with fibrosis involve both
     the peripheral and the central lungs as well as both upper and lower lung
     zones. Mostly involved areas are the apices bilaterally, the right middle
     lobe, and the lower lobes. In addition to this intersitial appearance, there
     are focal areas of speradded consolidation in the right juxtahilar area, lower
     lobes bilaterally, and part of the left upper lobe. There is no
     interlobular septal thickening or discrete lung nodules. There is no sizeable
     pleural effusion.
     
     The imaged portion of the upper abdomen is unremarkable except for aortic
     calcifications and mild perirenal stranding.  There are no bone lesions
     suspicious for malignancy.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Proabable hronic interstitial lung disease with fibrosis. In addition,
     there are focal consolidations most likely due to superadded infection,
     aspiration, or chronic ARDS. Overall appearnces are not highly suggestive for
     lymphangitis carcinomatosis or hematogenous metastases.
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA:
        16.4 mCi Tc-99m RBC ([**2511-9-27**]);
     HISTORY: Recent bright red blood per rectum, in the setting of sepsis and  
     multiorgan failure in the [**Hospital Unit Name 1245**]. 
      
     DECISION: 
      
     INTERPRETATION:  Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells
     labeled with Tc-99m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen for minutes
     were obtained.  A left lateral view of the pelvis was also obtained. 
      
     Blood flow images are unremarkable. The iliac arteries are ectactic. 
      
     Dynamic blood pool images show no definite early bleeding on images obtained
     over 0-60 minutes. Subsequently, after repositioning the patient over a [**9-13**]
     minute period, imaging shows evidence of hemorrhage in the sigmoid colon over
     the subsequent hour. 
      
     IMPRESSION: Late dynamic images demonstrating extravasation into the sigmoid
     colon, but no evidence of brisk bleeding within the first hour. This is most
     suggestive of a slow intermittent hemorrhage in the sigmoid colon.  These
     findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3675**] from the [**Hospital Unit Name 1245**] shortly after the study.
