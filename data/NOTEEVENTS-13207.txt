History of Present Illness:
The pt. is a 72 year-old male with a history of alcoholic 
cirrhosis complicated by chronic LE edema and cellulitis who 
presented with a 4 to 5 day history of diarrhea and decreased 
p.o. intake.  The pt. stated that he was in his USOH until 
September of this year when he began to develop watery, 
non-bloody diarrhea after being treated with clindamycin for 
lower extremity cellulitis.  At that time, he was empirically 
treated with flagyl for suspected c. difficile enterocolitis and 
his diarrhea abated.  He subsequently experienced diarrhea again 
in October under the same circumstances which also improved with 
flagyl.  The pt. reported that the same sequence of events 
occurred again beginning 4-5 days prior to admission.  The pt. 
stated that his diarrhea is watery and brown and primarily 
occurred after meals.  He has not noticed any blood in his 
stools.  He had been unable to tolerate p.o. for the past [**2-16**] 
days and stated that any time the pt. would attempt to take 
p.o., he would experience copious diarrhea.  The pt. admitted to 
a roughly 10 pound weight loss over this time period.  The pt. 
denied fever or diaphoresis but did complain of chills during 
the past four days.  He has also noticed increased redness and 
swelling of his lower extremities, more marked on the right.  He 
had been unable to ambulate secondary to lower extremity pain.  
On ROS, the pt. complained of a mild headache but denied chest 
pain, shortness of breath, nausea, dysuria.
In the ED, the pt. was a total of 2 liters of IV fluid, 60g of 
kayexelate for elevated serum potassium and IV oxacillin for 
lower extremity cellulitis.  An ultrasound of the pt's. RLE was 
performed and was negative for DVT.  He was admitted to the MICU 
for dehydration secondary to presumed c. difficile 
enterocolitis.  
 
Past Medical History:
-cirrhosis [**2-15**] alcohol abuse c/b grade 1 esophageal varices, 
gastric varices and thrombocytopenia; has been abstinent since 
[**3046**]
-chronic LE edema and cellulitis as a result of cirrhosis

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was a 72 yo male with alcoholic cirrhosis, admitted 
to the FICU with C diff colitis, RLE cellulitis, acute on 
chronic renal failure, enterobacter bacteremia, and anion gap 
metabolic acidosis.  He was stabalized in the FICU, called out 
on [**1-3**], and progressively developed acute on chronic hepatic 
insufficiency.  Hepatic failure thought to be due to chronic 
liver disease in setting of chronic infection.  He developed a 
hepatorenal syndrome and underwent hemodialysis but became 
acutely hypotensive.   He was transferred to the FICU [**3065-1-8**].  
A family meeting was held, and the patient was made DNR/DNI with 
emphasis on confort measures.  He expired [**3065-1-8**] at 20:48 with 
his family present.  During his hospitalization the following 
problems were addressed:

1. Acute on Chronic renal failure and Hypovolemia: The pt 
presented with severe volume depletion secondary to the history 
of severe diarrhea.  He was aggressively hydrated with IV fluids 
over the course of the first two hospital days.  IV fluids were 
discontinued once the pt. was able to tolerate p.o. fluids.  Pt 
presented with a serum creatinine that was elevated well above 
baseline on admission.  This rapidly improved with the 
administration of IV fluids, suggesting a prerenal azotemia on 
admission.  

Pt's renal function worsened when he developed acute on chronic 
hepatic insufficiency, likely due to worsening prerenal 
azotemia.  The renal team was following.  Despite colloid (PRBC) 
and sodium bicarbonate, pt's renal function continued to decline 
on the floor with worsening uremia.  On [**1-7**] pt was started on 
midodrine and octreotide.  He was transferred to the West campus 
for hemodialysis.  During hemodialysis he became acutely 
hypotensive.  Dialysis was discontinued and he was transferred 
to the FICU for further care.   

2. C. Difficile Colitis: The pt. was started on po metronidazole 
on admission.  His diarrhea subsequently abated over the course 
of the first hospital day.  Stool sent for c. difficle toxin 
assay confirmed the diagnosis.  Pt was maintained on PO 
metronidazole with repeat stool sample negative for C. Dif on 
[**1-6**].  However, he continued to have diarrhea whenever he ate, 
possibly functional or related to Abx use. 

3. Lower extremity cellulitis: The pt. presented with 
significant edema, erythema and tenderness of his right lower 
extremity.  He was started on IV oxacillin which was continued 
for the first two hospital days.  However, the pt's. cellulitis 
worsened on this regimen.  Over concern for possible 
community-acquired MRSA cellulitis, IV vancomycin was begun on 
the third hospital day.  As there continued to be no 
improvement, an MRI of the lower extremities was performed over 
concern for possible abscess or osteomyelitis.  There was no 
evidence of abscess on MR, just non-specific edema.  On the 
floor, in the setting of his worsening renal function, pt's IV 
vancomycin was continued and dosed daily by level. 

4. Enterobacter bacteremia: The pt. was noted to have [**1-17**] 
bottles positive for Enterobacter.  Accordingly, he was placed 
on ceftriaxone and levofloxacin.  He remained afebrile for the 
duration of the MICU stay and he never developed signs or 
symptoms suggestive of sepsis or SBP.  He was maintained on IV 
Levofloxacin and Cefepime on the floor, the latter to cover for 
?Pseudomonas from his cellulitis.  

5. Hypoxia: Pt was noted to have bilateral pleural effusions and 
mild fluid overloaded, likely due hepatic and renal failure.  
IVFs were stopped.  Pt remained stable on 3L of oxygen by nasal 
canula on the floor, but desaturated on transfer to the FICU.  

6. Hemoptysis: The pt. experienced an episode of hemoptysis on 
hospital day 5. The initial concern was for variceal bleeding 
and he was intubated for airway protection, started on 
octreotide, and given FFP and platelets. EGD showed nonbleeding 
varices.  Bronchoscopy showed some blood but no bleeding source 
suggestive of aspiration. It was ultimately felt that he was 
suffering from epistaxis secondary to oxygen therapy via nasal 
cannula.  He was extubated after 24 hours and did not experience 
any further episodes.

7. Acute on Chronic Hepatic Insufficiency: Pt has a history of 
alcoholic cirrhosis.  The etiology of his acutely worsening 
liver function is unclear, but likely due to infection.  The 
liver team followed, and advised that the pt's liver disease 
portended a poor prognosis.  A paracentesis on [**1-5**] drained 
500cc of fluid which had SAAG supporting portal hypertension, as 
suspected, and ruling out SBP.  His total bili continued to rise 
in the setting of renal insufficiency.  He was maintained on SQ 
vitamin K. On transfer to the FICU the patient was jaundiced 
with total bilirubin 17.  Mental status quickly deteriorated 
over the afternoon. 

8. AAA: Stable at 3.5cm.

9. Swallowing: A video swallow found a small amount of 
penetration identified with thin liquid and pill, otherwise no 
aspiration.

10.  The patient was transferred to the FICU on [**3065-1-8**] after 
decompensating into end stage hepatic failure and renal failure 
on the floor, intolerant of hemodialysis.  A family meeting was 
held, and the patient was made DNR/DNI with emphasis on comfort 
measures.  He expired [**3065-1-8**] at 20:48 with his family present.

     72 year old man with cellulitis requiring long-term intravenous antibiotics.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:
     
     This procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1292**] [**Name (STitle) 1293**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1242**] [**Name (STitle) 1243**], with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 1243**], Attending Radiologist, supervising the entire procedure. The patient's
     right upper arm was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  Under
     ultrasonographic guidance, the right brachial vein was accessed after local
     administration of 1% lidocaine with a 21-gauge micropuncture needle.  The
     graded guide wire was advanced through the needle under fluoroscopic guidance
     into the superior vena cava.  A skin [**Doctor Last Name 352**] with #11 blade scalpel was made
     adjacent to the needle.  The needle was exchanged for a 4-French micropuncture
     sheath with inner dilator.  The inner dilator was removed.  It was determined
     that a length of 35 cm would be appropriate.  The PICC line was cut to length
     and advanced over the guide wire into the superior vena cava using
     fluoroscopic guidance.  The guide wire and sheath were removed.  Final chest
     x-ray demonstrates tip of the PICC line to be within the superior vena cava.
     The catheter was flushed, capped and heplocked, and secured to the skin using
     StatLock.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Single-lumen 35-cm right brachial PICC line with tip in SVC, ready for

     Complete abdominal ultrasound:  The liver is shrunken and nodular in
     appearance consistent with cirrhosis.  There is a 1.4 cm anechoic cyst with
     some apparent wall calcification within the left lobe.  There is a large
     amount of ascites.  No stones are identified within the gallbladder.  Note is
     again made of an aortic aneurysm which measures 3.5 cm in greatest axial
     dimension.  This is not changed from the measurements from [**3063-6-16**].  The
     right kidney measures 10.7 cm.  The left kidney measures 10.6 cm.  There is no
     evidence of hydronephrosis, masses, or stones.  There is splenomegaly as
     previously identified.  The common bile duct measures 4 mm.
     
     Liver Doppler ultrasound:  The flow, waveforms, and direction of the hepatic
     veins is unremarkable.  The right and left hepatic arteries are seen and are
     normal.  The portal vein is identified and the flow is reversed and is now
     hepatofugal.  Normal flow and direction is identified within the splenic vein.

Nursing Admit Note

This is a 73 yo male with a PMed Hx of ETOH cirrhosis with grade 1 esophogeal varices, gastric varices and thrombocytopenia- stopped drinking 1986, chronic LE edema and cellulitis secondary to the cirrhosis, HTN, normocytic anemia, AAA, constipation, cdif, CRI, agorophobia, lipomas, 30 pk yr smoker - quit 30 yrs ago.  He was admitted to this unit on [**12-26**] for hypotension with cdif infection and cellulitis.  He was able to leave the unit after a week.  Today he was in the dialysis unit starting dialysis, he dropped his BP to the 80s, SAT was 96% on 100%.  He was transfered here for further care.  On arrival he was alert but having difficulty breathing, his SBP was initially in the low 100s but dialysis was tried again and after 400cc was taken off he dropped his BP to the 40s, he was given 800cc back and the dialysis was stopped.  After discussion with the family he was made DNR/DNI.

Systems Review

Neuro:  His MS [**First Name (Titles) 586**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1929**] and waned some here, he was initially A&Ox3 though very weak, with the drop in his BP he is a little less alert.

CV:  His SBP in now in the 70s, HR 50s-90s, he was initially going to be given IV lasix but this is now on hold due to his hypotension.

Resp:  LS very diminished 1/2 up from the bases, coarse in the upper half, 02 SAt 93 % with a scoop mask on 100%, RR teens to 30s.  He intermittantly has difficulty breathing, this is in part because the back of his throat is very dry.  He has been given wet mouth swabs to try and ease this but he has difficulty swallowing.

GI:  ABD distended, not able to take PO because he cannot swallow very well.  Poor nutrition, he has anasarca and is weeping from any open area on his skin.

GU:  Foley in place as well a a quintin cath in the L groin, sm amount of amber colored urine.

Comfort:  He was given 1 mg of MS04 for comfort - during his past admission 1-2 mg had been fairly effective.  The priest was in to see him.
