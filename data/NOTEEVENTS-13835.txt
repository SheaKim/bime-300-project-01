Brief Hospital Course:
1)Pyelonephritis: Patient presented with several day history of 
fever and chills.  CT abdomen on admission was suggestive of 
left pyelonephritis.  She had a positive UA so she was initially 
started on IV levofloxacin.  However, she became hypotensive the 
first night requiring short stay in the ICU where she got R IJ 
central line placed, received 2 liters of IVF and Gentamycin was 
added.  She grew 8/8 bottles gram negative rods from adission.  
It later grew levofloxacin-resistant E.Coli.  Since she is 
allergic to penicillin and refused to try cephalosporin 
sensitization, antibiotic was switched to IV Aztreonam.  (E.Coli 
sensitive to Aztreonam).  She got PICC line placed and was 
discharged with 14 day course of Aztreonam.  The surveillance 
culture after Gentamycin was added showed no growth to date.

2)Chest pain: Patient developed pleuric chest/epigastric pain on 
[**5-9**].  She has a history of PUD but describes this pain to be 
different.  She got a V/Q scan which was negative for PE.  The 
etiology of this pleuritic chest pain remaines unclear.

3)Hyponatremia: Na on admission was 129 which resolved after IVF 
hydration.

4)HTN: Her BP meds were held while she was septic but was 
re-started on discharge.
