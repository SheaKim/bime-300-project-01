Admission Date:  [**3318-2-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**3318-2-10**]

Date of Birth:   [**3241-6-8**]     Sex:  M

Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Transfer from outside hospital for
evaluation for TIPS / Esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 76 year old
very pleasant gentleman with a past medical history
significant for invasive adenocarcinoma of the stomach status
post near total gastrectomy in [**3317-9-15**], with
Roux-en-Y anastomosis and partial jejunal pouch, cirrhosis,
coronary artery disease and orthostatic hypotension who was
admitted to [**Hospital6 2330**] on [**3318-1-20**] with
complaints of nausea and dysphagia.

At the [**Hospital6 2330**] Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8845**] [**Last Name (Titles) 877**] an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed esophageal varices
and stricture.  He has had three esophageal dilatations in
the past for stricture at anastomotic site.  Dilation could
not be performed at this time given his report of large
varices.  He was therefore transferred for evaluation.

In addition, at [**Hospital6 2330**], Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8845**] had
a transthoracic echocardiogram for evaluation of orthostatic
hypotension which was unremarkable.

He was noted to have significant orthostatic changes which
was felt secondary to autonomic dysfunction after his
Florinef was discontinued.  He instead was transferred to
Midodrine with some improvement in his blood pressure.  Other
work-up at [**Hospital6 2330**] included paracentesis
with albumin which showed SAAG greater than 1.1.  Cytology
was negative for malignancy and there was no evidence of SVP.
He was unable to tolerate more than liquids while at the
hospital secondary to coughing which was felt secondary to
aspiration.

On admission to [**Hospital1 10**], he was
initially managed on the Medicine Floor.  However, on
hospital day number two, he was noted to have desaturations
and tachypnea and was complaining of a feeling of an
obstruction in his throat.  He had been n.p.o. prior to this
event.  He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
and was maintained on 100% nonrebreather face mask for the
first two days in the Intensive Care Unit.  He was slowly
weaned off oxygen, however, had a respiratory event on
hospital day number five, at which time he was intubated.

The following morning, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was
performed and the remainder of hospital course will follow.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  History of pancytopenia.
2.  Invasive gastric adenocarcinoma status post near total
gastrectomy in [**3317-9-15**].  He had an esophageal to

very active in Alcoholics Anonymous and has not had any
alcohol since diagnosis of cirrhosis.  Tobacco use:
Twenty-four years, also quit 29 years ago; approximately one
pack per day.  No history of illicit drug use.  The patient
lives alone in [**Location (un) 1688**], [**State 277**].  He has no close
relatives.  His point of contact is his friend, Deputy Chief
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8846**] whose phone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8847**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On presentation to the Medicine Floor
is temperature 95.1 F.; blood pressure 120/70; heart rate 82;
respiratory rate 22; 97% on four liters oxygen by nasal
cannula.  In general, the patient appeared comfortable in no
apparent distress.  His pupils were equal, round and
reactive.  Extraocular muscles are intact.   Mucous membranes
were dry.  Oropharynx was clear.  He had poor dentition.  His
heart was regular rate.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops were
appreciated.  He had bilateral basilar crackles, right
greater than left.  On abdominal examination, he had
hypoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended; a
very large horizontal abdominal scar was present and he was
dull to percussion throughout with a positive fluid wave.  On
extremities:  No lower extremity edema.  He had [**Male First Name (un) 374**] stockings
on.  His skin was dry with some ecchymoses over his chest and
right upper extremity.  He had some spider angiomas.  On
neurological examination he was alert and oriented times
four.  Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.  He had
four over five bilateral upper extremity strength, four over
five lower extremities bilateral strength and sensation was
intact.

LABORATORY:  On transfer white blood cell count 9.6,
hematocrit 31.7 at his baseline; platelets 122.  Sodium 141,
potassium 3.5, chloride 110, bicarbonate 22, BUN 14,
creatinine 0.7, glucose 108, albumin 2.1; total protein 4.7.
LDH 196, total bilirubin 1.7, alkaline phosphatase 82.  ALT
5, AST 20, INR 1.4, uric acid 4.7.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 76 year old gentleman with a history
of gastric cancer status post near total gastrectomy with an
esophageal duodenal Roux-en-Y procedure who has had three
esophageal dilatations secondary to stricture at the
anastomotic site, who was transferred from outside hospital
for complaints of dysphagia and nausea.  He was transferred
for evaluation of TIPS procedure and repeat EGD for
evaluation of swallowing complaints which was thought
secondary to aspiration.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  GASTROENTEROLOGY:  As stated above, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8848**] main
complaint included dysphagia which was thought secondary to
mechanical obstruction at his anastomotic site from a history
of gastric cancer treated in 10/2003.  After intubation on
hospital day number five, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8845**] [**Last Name (Titles) 877**] an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed no stricture and a
wide open anastomosis with visible aspiration of secretions.

General Surgery was consulted as well as Gastroenterology for
possible interventions as it was felt that the reason he was
intubated was secondary to recurrent aspiration.  The
conclusions from both consultations obtained was that there
was no surgical or endoscopic intervention.

2.  RESPIRATORY DISTRESS:  He was intubated on hospital day
number five for respiratory distress secondary to persistent
aspiration through his esophageal duodenal anastomosis.  Mr.
[**Known patient lastname 8845**] was not able to be weaned from the ventilator given
the development of metabolic acidosis which will be described
below.  He was finally extubated on [**3318-2-10**], and expired
within a few hours.

3.  ENTEROCOCCUS BACTEREMIA:  On [**3318-2-3**], Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8845**] had
a one out of four blood culture bottles growing enterococcus
which was sensitive to Vancomycin.  He had a subclavian line
at that time which was discontinued and the catheter tip sent
for culture which did not have any growth.  He was continued
on Vancomycin intravenously for his bacteremia and remained
afebrile.

4.  LEUKOCYTOSIS:  On hospital day number six and seven, the
patient had significant and acute increase in his white blood
cell count from 11 to 41.  A differential at that time showed
7% bands.  There was no clear source of infection, however,
given the rapid and very high increase in his white count,
Clostridium difficile colitis was suspected.  In addition,
other diagnoses which were entertained were sepsis and
mesenteric ischemia.  A CT scan of the abdomen was performed
which showed no evidence of abscess with some colonic
thickening which was nonspecific.

Also of note, he had significant ascites which was tapped and
showed 85 white cells and a SAAG of less than 1; therefore it
was not felt that the patient had peritonitis as an
explanation for his leukocytosis.

He was placed on p.o. Vancomycin and continued on intravenous
Flagyl and Levaquin which were started on hospital day number
two for presumed aspiration pneumonia.

5.  ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8848**] mental status was
clear until the time of aspiration event on hospital day
number five when he was intubated.  He was continued on
Propofol and was taken off it on a number of occasions at
which time Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8848**] delirium d[**MD Number 563**] recover.  He was
not oriented for the remainder of his hospital course.  It
was felt that this was mostly toxic metabolic in nature given
his significant leukocytosis and likely hepatic
encephalopathy.

6.  HYPOTENSION:  The patient was started on Neo-Synephrine
at the time of his intubation on hospital day number five and
was never able to be weaned off pressors.  He responded well
to intravenous fluid boluses at times, however, his pressors
were continued.  He had a number of reasons for his
hypotension including acute issues such as sepsis,
leukocytosis, sedating medications, nutritional deficiency as
well as chronic issues which included baseline autonomic
dysfunction.

7.  LEGAL ISSUES:  Prior to intubation, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8845**] elected
his friend, Deputy Chief [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8846**], to serve as his
health care proxy and durable power of attorney.  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8845**]
has no relatives in the area.  On [**3318-2-10**], as Mr.
[**Known patient lastname 8848**] condition continue to deteriorate despite full
effort and full life sustaining support measures.

In accordance to the patient's wishes, Deputy Chief [**Doctor Last Name 8846**]
elected to have Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8845**] [**Last Name (Titles) 8849**] on [**3318-2-10**] and he
expired within a few hours.

An autopsy was requested, however, due to the fact that Mr.
[**Name13 (STitle) 8846**] is not a family member, this could not be performed
under [**State 277**] Law.  Multiple attempts were made to
contact any living family members, however, these were not
successful.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Invasive gastric carcinoma status post total gastrectomy
in [**3317-9-15**] with a transverse colectomy.
2.  Respiratory failure secondary to recurrent aspiration.
3.  Bacteremia.
4.  Leukocytosis which was likely secondary to Clostridium
difficile colitis, possible mesenteric ischemia.
5.  Hypotension.
6.  Aspiration pneumonia.
7.  Coagulopathy, acquired.
8.  Cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use.
9.  Ascites.

     Right subclavian vascular catheter remains in satisfactory position. The heart
     size and pulmonary vascularity are within normal limits. Again demonstrated
     are multifocal pulmonary opacities throughout the right lung. These have
     slightly progressed in the interval with an area of coalescing air space
     opacity noted peripherally within the right mid and lower lung zones. Some of
     the more patchy opacities have a somewhat nodular appearance.  There is
     persistent left retrocardiac opacification but the remaining portion of the
     left lung is grossly clear.  Bilateral pleural effusions are demonstrated.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Progressive multifocal pulmonary opacities in the right lung. Additional
     patchy areas of opacity througout the remaining right lung with somewhat
     nodular appearance. These findings could be due to evolving pneumonia. A
     massive aspiration event is also possible. Without older films for comparison,
     it is difficult to exclude other underlying process including malignancy
     and followup radiographs are recommended to ensure resolution.

     The examination is technically limited due to AP portable technique, as well
     as semi-erect positioning and lordotic projection.  Additionally, in the
     lateral view,  the arms are not well positioned, resulting in obscuration of
     normally clear retrosternal space.  Exposure factors are also suboptimal
     resulting in an overpenetrated appearance of the left lung limiting
     parenchymal detail in this region.  There are bilateral pleural effusions
     present, moderate on the left and small on the right.  Multifocal patchy areas
     of parenchymal opacification are seen throughout the right lung and within the
     left retrocardiac region.  Several air bronchograms are noted consistent with

     CLINICAL HISTORY: Hypoxia now, s/p LSC.  Evaluate line placement.
     
     CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:
     
     FINDINGS: The left subclavian central line is present, tip at junction between
     inominate  and SVC.  No pneumothorax.  Linear densities overlying left apex
     are likely artifactual.  There are patchy opacities throughout both lungs,
     most pronounced at the right upper and lower zones and left lower zone and
     left pleural effusion.  The opacities are more pronounced peripherally.   The
     findings have progressed slightly compared with one day earlier.
     
     IMPRESSION: Patchy opacities in both lungs and small left pleural effusion.
     Differential diagnosis includes pneumonic infiltrates and early ARDS.  The
     peripheral nature of the findings also suggests the possibility of an embolic
     phenomenom including septic emboli. CHF is considered less likely given th
     peripheral distribution.   Clinical correlation is requested for full
     assessment.

     INDICATION:  History of locally advanced gastric carcinoma, status post
     resection, with chronic aspiration and new leukocytosis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis are performed after the
     administration of oral and IV contrast.  150 cc of Optiray nonionic contrast
     was administered, and nonionic contrast was used for patient debility.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There are marked interstitial changes, with
     scarring and ground glass opacity at the right lung base, which may be
     consistent with infection or chronic aspiration.  Additionally, there is a
     combination of atelectasis/consolidation at the left lung base dependently as
     well.  There are bilateral moderate pleural effusions, left greater than
     right.  Visualized portions of the heart and pericardium are within normal
     limits. The liver has a shrunken appearance, consistent with cirrhosis. There
     is gallbladder wall edema, in conjunction with multiple calcified gallstones.
     The spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys appear to be within normal
     limits.  NG tube is present within the stomach, which is anastomosed with a
     Billroth-II type configuration.  There is an extremely large amount of ascites
     fluid present.  The small bowel appears to be within normal limits, perhaps
     with some wall edema.  There is no significant abdominal lymphadenopathy
     present.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There is diffuse edema and thickening of the
     bowel wall, particularly involving the ascending colon.  The bladder and
     visualized portions of the ureters appear within normal limits.  There is a
     large amount of pelvic free fluid tracking from the abdomen, and there is no
     significant pelvic lymphadenopathy present.  There are bilateral fluid-filled
     inguinal hernias.
     
     Examination of the osseous structures show severe degenerative changes at the
     lower lumbar spine/sacrum.  No other abnormalities are noted.
     
     There is diffuse soft tissue edema as well.

      ? perforation                                                                   
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Abdominal pain and increased white blood cell count.
     
     No previous films for comparison.  Allowing for poor detail, the bowel gas
     distribution is unremarkable and there is no evidence for intestinal
     obstruction.  Small radiodensity overlies mid-pole region of left kidney and a
     few small radiodensities, either calcifications or retained contrast in
     colonic diverticula overlie the left mid abdomen.  Further unusually shaped
     possibly calcified density is noted in the suprapubic region, only partly
     included on this film.  Degenerative changes are present in the lower lumbar
     spine. Surgical clips are present in the left upper quadrant.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence for intestinal obstruction.  Scattered
     radiodensities, some of which may be calcific foci, in left abdomen and
     suprapubic region, as described, but findings are difficult to evaluate on
     this single suboptimal film and without any relevant clincal information
     related to prior surgery, or previous abdominal films for comparison.

Events

 Propofol dc'd this am to assess MS, pt has been unresponsive since that time. Team aware and HCP notified to discuss pt's status and plan of care. After speaking w/ HCP it was decided to change pt's status to DNR. The HCP is contacting pt's friends/family so that they may visit the pt if they wish. The plan is to chnage the pt's status to CMO and extubate him tomorrow after his support system has had the chance to visit him.

Review of Systems

Neuro- As stated above, prop gtt dc'd this morning. Pt has not been responsive to stimuli or pn. This afternoon, pt increasingly tachypneic or tachycardic, HO notified and 2x 1mg doses of MSO4 given w/ good effect. 
Resp- AC 700x14x60%x5 peep. PT is overbreathing, RR 20-30's. PT has a sig met acidosis w/ resp compensation.  LS  diminished throughout. Sats 100%. Suctioned 2 x for scant secretions.
CV- HR 110-120's, ST, no ectopy. SBP 88-92. Cont on neo gtt @ 1.49 mcg/kg/min. Plan to titrate as needed for hypotension per HO. No plan to add any other pressors however. PT does b/c acutlet hypotensive w. turns.
GI- Abd soft, hypoactive BS. Rectal exam done by HO, no stool noted in rectum. Recieving TPN for nutritional support.
GU- adeqaute u/o/hr, cont to follow.
Skin- Both arms weeping from old line insertion sites and skin tears. Cont to redress as needed. Abd dsg intact.
Plan- Cont supportive medical care w/ comfort as a focus.

Pt has required increasing amts of Neo to maintain MAP>60. Currently on 2.3mcg/kg/min. Pt's proxy has decided to come in and plans on extubating him this evening. He has informed all pt's friends of his poor condition and no other friends plan to come in tonight. His proxy does not want to take the chance of pt dying through the night and not being there for him. The plan at this point is for the team to come in and speak to proxy before extubation. Extubate pt and shut off his pressors and use morphine as needed for comfort. Pt currently becomes tacchypneic, increased tachycardia with any stimulation so may require morphine drip to ensure comfort. Will discuss this with team. Proxy is due to arrive at about 6:30PM.

Accepted pt and he was unresponsive to all stimuli. Extubated prior to start of shift, pt was started on MSO4 gtt for comfort measures and was made a DNR. Pt required frequent boluses of MSO4 to maintain respirations <20 and subsequently was increased to a gtt rate of 20mg/hr where he appeared comfortable and w/o distress. Pt expired at app 2208. Health care proxy notified as he was in the hospital and had only left the room for a short period. Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1391**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4645**] pronounced pt and a consent was given for autopsy.
