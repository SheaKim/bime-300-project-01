[**2614-1-6**] 3:30 PM

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Acute onset of monocular blindness. ? for 
intra- arterial TPA.

RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 9328**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 803**], the Attending Radiologist, 
present and supervising the entire procedure.

TECHNIQUE: Informed consent was obtained from the patient and 
the patient's family after explaining the risks, indications and 
alternative management. Risks explained included stroke, loss of 
vision and speech, temporary or permanent, with possible 
treatment with stent and coils if needed. 

The patient was brought to the Interventional Neuroradiology 
Theater and placed on the biplane table in supine position. Both 
groins were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. 
Access to the right common femoral artery was obtained using a 
19-gauge single wall needle, under local anesthesia using 1% 
lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate and with aseptic 
precautions. Through the needle, a 0.35 [**Last Name (un) 5606**] wire was 
introduced and the needle taken out. Over the wire, a 5 Fr 
vascular sheath was placed and connected to a saline infusion 
(mixed with heparin 500 units in 500 cc of saline) with a 
continuous drip. Through the sheath, a 4 Fr Berenstein catheter 
was introduced and connected to continuous saline infusion (with 
mixture of 1000 units of heparin in 1000 cc of saline). 
The following blood vessel was selectively catheterized and 
angiograms were obtained in AP, lateral, and 3-D projections:
-Right common carotid artery

FINDINGS: Evaluation of the right CCA, ECA, and ICA demonstrate 
no evidence of aneurysm, vascular malformation, or vascular 
occlusion. However, there is luminal irregularity at the 
proximal segment of the cervical CCA, leading to an 
approximately 40% of stenosis.

CONCLUSION: Luminal irregularity, likely to indicate 
atherosclerotic disease, at the proximal segment of the right 
common carotid artery, suggestive of mild stenosis. No other 
abnormality is identified.
The opthalmic artery appears patent. 

[**2614-1-6**] 1:55 PM

CT HEAD

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Acute loss of vision in right eye. ? 
bleed.

FINDINGS: There are several tiny, well-defined hypodense lesions 
in the periventricular white matter of both cerebral hemispheres 
and the head of the left caudate nucleus (series 2, image 15). 
They are likely representative of chronic lacunar infarcts.

[**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is otherwise preserved. No 
intracranial mass or mass effect is evident. No intra-axial or 
extra-axial fluid collections or hematoma is seen. No 
displacement of normally midline structures is evident.

CONCLUSION:
1. Chronic lacunar infarcts in the periventricular white matter 
of both cerebral hemispheres and the head of the left caudate 
nucleus.
2. No intracranial hematoma.
3. No CT features of acute major vascular territorial infarct, 
although a head MRI with DWI images is a more sensitive study to 
detect acute cerebral ischemic changes.

CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT)  [**2614-1-9**] 6:18 PM

PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The heart is normal in size. 
The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There is 
calcification of the aortic knob. The pulmonary vascularity is 
normal. The lungs are clear. There are no focal consolidations, 
pleural effusions, or pneumothorax demonstrated. The osseous 
structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS FOLLOWING CAROTID ENDARTERECTOMY

.

This information is designed as a guideline to assist [**Doctor First Name **] in a 
speedy recovery from your surgery. Please follow these 
guidelines unless your physician has specifically instructed [**Doctor First Name **] 
otherwise. Please call our office nurse if [**Doctor First Name **] have any 
questions. Dial 911 if [**Doctor First Name **] have any medical emergency.

.

ACTIVITY:

.

There are no specific restrictions on activity. Gradually 
increase your level of activity back to normal depending upon 
the way [**Doctor First Name **] feel. Fatigue is expected for the first several 
weeks. Resume driving when [**Doctor First Name **] are able to comfortably move your 
head without pain or stiffness. 

.

PLEASE CALL US IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS: 

.

Weakness, numbness, tingling involving your arm, leg or face .

.

Loss of vision .

.

Difficulty speaking .

.

Severe headache (mild headache is common) .

.

Increasing swelling, pain, drainage or redness of the neck 
wound,

.

Watch for signs and symptoms of infection. These are: a fever 
greater than 101 degrees, chills, increased redness, or pus 
draining from the incision site. If [**Doctor First Name **] experience any of these 
or bleeding at the incision site, CALL THE DOCTOR.

. 

Exercise:

.

Limit strenuous activity for 2 weeks. 

.

No driving untill cleared by your surgeon. He should be able to 
clear [**Doctor First Name **] to drive when [**Doctor First Name **] are able to comfortably move your 
head without pain or stiffness . If [**Doctor First Name **] can do this before your 
appointment with the doctor, call and ask him if [**Doctor First Name **] can drive.

No heavy lifting greater than 20 pounds for the next 7 days. 

.

Avoid excessive turning of the head, nodding of the head for the 
next 7 days. 

.

BATHING/SHOWERING:

. 

[**Doctor First Name 54**] may bathe or shower immediately upon coming home. Do not put 
your neck / head into the water. A clear dressing will cover 
your neck incision and this should be left in place for three 
(3) days. Remove it after this time and wash your incision 
gently with soap and water. Dissolving sutures, which do not 
have to be removed, were used. Shaving is permitted when the 
dressing is removed.

. 

WOUND CARE:

.

Suture / Staples may be removed before discharge. If they are 
not, an appointment will be made for [**Doctor First Name **] to return for removal. 

.

When the sutures / staples are removed the doctor may or may not 
place pieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision. 
These will stay on about a week and [**Doctor First Name **] may shower with them on. 
If these do not fall off after 10 days, [**Doctor First Name **] may peel them off 
with warm water and soap in the shower. 

.

Avoid taking a tub bath, swimming, or soaking in a hot tub for 
two weeks after surgery. 

.

MEDICATIONS:

.

[**Doctor First Name 54**] may resume taking medication [**Doctor First Name **] were on prior to your 
surgery unless specifically instructed otherwise by your 
physician [**Name9 (PRE) 54**] will be given a new prescription for pain 
medication, which should be taken every three (3) to four (4) 
hours only if necessary.

. 

Remember that narcotic pain meds can be constipating and [**Doctor First Name **] 
should increase the fluid and bulk foods in your diet. (Check 
with your physician if [**Doctor First Name **] have fluid restrictions.) If [**Doctor First Name **] feel 
that [**Doctor First Name **] are constipated, do not strain at the toilet. [**Doctor First Name 54**] may 
use over the counter Metamucil or Milk of Magnesia. Appetite 
suppression may occur; this will improve with time. Eat small 
balanced meals throughout the day.

.

CAUTIONS:

.

NO SMOKING! We know you've heard this before, but it really is 
an important step to your recovery. Smoking causes narrowing of 
your blood vessels which in turn decreases circulation. If [**Doctor First Name **] 
smoke [**Doctor First Name **] will need to stop as soon as possible. Ask your nurse 
or doctor for information on smoking cessation.

.

No strenuous activity for 4-6 weeks after surgery. 

.

DIET:

.

There are no special restrictions on your diet postoperatively. 
Poor appetite is expected for several weeks and small, frequent 
meals may be preferred. 

.

For people with vascular problems we would recommend a 
cholesterol lowering diet: Follow a diet low in total fat and 
low in saturated fat and in cholesterol to improve lipid profile 
in your blood. Additionally, some people see a reduction in 
serum cholesterol by reducing dietary cholesterol. Since a 
reduction in dietary cholesterol is not harmful, we suggest that 
most people reduce dietary fat, saturated fat and cholesterol to 
decrease total cholesterol and LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein-the 
bad cholesterol). Exercise will increase your HDL (High Density 
Lipoprotein-the good cholesterol) and with your doctor's 
permission, is typically recommended.. [**Doctor First Name 54**] may be self-referred 
or get a referral from your doctor.

. 

If [**Doctor First Name **] are overweight, [**Doctor First Name **] need to think about starting a weight 
management program. Your health and its improvement depend on 
it. We know that making changes in your lifestyle will not be 
easy, and it will require a whole new set of habits and a new 
attitude.. If interested [**Doctor First Name **] can may be self-referred or can get 
a referral from your doctor. 

.

If [**Doctor First Name **] have diabetes and would like additional guidance, [**Doctor First Name **] may 
request a referral from your doctor.

.

FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT:

.

Be sure to keep your medical appointments. The key to your 
improving health will be to keep a tight reign on any of the 
chronic medical conditions that [**Doctor First Name **] have. Things like high blood 
pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol are major villains to 
the blood vessels. Don't let them go untreated!

. 

Please call the office on the first working day after your 
discharge from the hospital to schedule a follow-up visit. This 
should be scheduled on the calendar for seven to fourteen days 
after discharge. Normal office hours are 8:30-5:30 Monday 
through Friday.

.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      68 year old man with left visual loss (monocular)                               
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      r/o left carotid stenosis                                                       
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     STUDIES:  Carotid series complete.
     
     REASON:  Left TIA visual loss.
     
     FINDINGS:  Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid arteries.  On the
     right, although there is not significant elevation of velocities, there is a
     fairly extensive plaque on Grayscale that extends proximally in the common
     carotid artery.
     
     On the right, peak systolic velocities are 101, 102, 129 in the ICA, CCA, and
     ECA respectively.  The ICA to CCA ratio is 1.  This is consistent with less
     than 40% stenosis.
     
     On the left, peak systolic velocities are 80, 126, 126 in ICA, CCA, ECA
     respectively.  The ICA to CCA ratio is 0.6.  This is consistent with less than
     40% stenosis.
     
     There is antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.  Of note, on the right
     side, there appears to be extensive plaque from a Grayscale perspective but
     there are no elevation of velocities.  In addition, this appears to be located
     in the common carotid artery.

     placed on the biplane table in supine position. Both groins were prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion. Access to the right common femoral artery
     was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall needle, under local anesthesia using
     1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate and with aseptic precautions.
     Through the needle, a 0.35 [**Last Name (un) 528**] wire was introduced and the needle taken
     out. Over the wire, a 5 Fr vascular sheath was placed and connected to a
     saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units in 500 cc of saline) with a
     continuous drip. Through the sheath, a 4 Fr Berenstein catheter was introduced
     and connected to continuous saline infusion (with mixture of 1000 units of
     heparin in 1000 cc of saline). 
     The following blood vessel was selectively catheterized and angiograms were
     obtained in AP, lateral, and 3-D projections:
     -Right common carotid artery
     
     FINDINGS:  Evaluation of the right CCA, ECA, and ICA demonstrate no evidence
     of aneurysm, vascular malformation, or vascular occlusion.  However, there is
     luminal irregularity at the proximal segment of the cervical CCA, leading to
     an approximately 40% of stenosis.
     
     CONCLUSION: Luminal irregularity, likely to indicate atherosclerotic disease,
     at the proximal segment of the right common carotid artery, suggestive of mild
     stenosis.  No other abnormality is identified.
     The opthalmic artery appears patent. The patient symptoms improved. Upon
     extensive discussion with the Neurology it was decided not to perform any

     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Acute loss of vision in right [**Hospital Unit Name 212**].  ? bleed.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast axial head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There are several tiny, well-defined hypodense lesions in the
     periventricular white matter of both cerebral hemispheres and the head of the
     left caudate nucleus (series 2, image 15).  They are likely  representative of
     chronic lacunar infarcts.
     
     [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is otherwise preserved.  No intracranial
     mass or mass effect is evident.  No intra-axial or extra-axial fluid
     collections or hematoma is seen.  No displacement of normally midline
     structures is evident.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     1.  Chronic lacunar infarcts in the periventricular white matter of both
     cerebral hemispheres and the head of the left caudate nucleus.
     2.  No intracranial hematoma.
     3.  No CT features of acute major vascular territorial infarct, although a
     head MRI with DWI images is a more sensitive study to detect acute cerebral
     ischemic changes.
