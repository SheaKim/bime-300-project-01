Admission Date:  [**3434-6-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**3434-6-20**]

Date of Birth:   [**3370-8-21**]     Sex:  F

Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63-year-old woman with
a history of lung cancer (adenocarcinoma) status post
resection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with
multiple hospital admissions for pneumonia, insulin
dependent-diabetes mellitus, who initially presented to the
Emergency Room on the [**3434-6-12**] complaining of
dyspnea.

The patient was found to be hypoxic and hypotensive in the
Emergency Room.  She complained of increasing shortness of
breath and a cough productive for a small amount of
reddish-brown sputum for approximately one week prior to
admission.  She also complained of subjective fevers of
approximately 101.

REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  The patient complained of chills,
nausea.  Denies vomiting and diarrhea.  The patient reports
that at baseline, she is fatigued and weak.  The family notes
a gradual decline in her physical function over the past six
months.  This morning the patient was found to be
dramatically more short of breath and was transported to the
Emergency Department by EMS.  Her O2 saturations on room air
were found to be 77% with an initial blood pressure of
120/90.  Her O2 saturations increased to approximately 90% on
a nonrebreather, but her systolic blood pressure dropped to
the 70's systolic.

The patient was given 1-2 liters of IV fluid, and then was
gently weaned off her nonrebreather on to a nasal cannula
mask.  Patient was also found to have an anion gap of 21 and
given her history of insulin dependent diabetes, was bolused
with 5 units of insulin and started on an insulin drip.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Lung cancer (adenocarcinoma) status post bilateral upper
lobe resection and radiation therapy in [**3426**].
2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with her latest
pulmonary function tests in [**3433-9-15**] showing a FVC
of 72% of predicted value, a FEV1 of 61% of predicted value,
FEV1/FVC of 85%, a DLCO which was read as moderately to
severely depressed.
3. Diabetes type 1.
4. Arthritis.
5. Pseudogout.
6. Hypothyroidism.
7. Osteoporosis.
8. Atrophic gastritis.
9. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
10. Chronic right pleural effusion, status post VATS.
11. Depression.
12. Nephrolithiasis.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Lung resection in [**3426**].
2. Cholecystectomy.
3. Appendectomy.
4. Adenoidectomy.

ALLERGIES:
1. Penicillin.
2. Flagyl.
3. Erythromycin.
4. Keflex.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She continues to smoke tobacco approximately
half a pack per day.  She has approximately 45 pack year
history.  She is a social drinker.  She lives at home with
her husband and son.

INITIAL LABORATORIES:  Revealed a white blood cell count of
19, hematocrit of 43.3, platelet count of 505.  INR of 1.1.
Her Chem-10 shows a sodium of 140, potassium of 4.7, chloride
of 98, bicarb of 21, BUN of 18, creatinine of 0.9, glucose of
238, anion gap of 21.  Her initial blood gas was 7.33/42/35
on 6 liters of oxygen.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Bactrim [**MD Number 1335**] strength.
2. Calcium/vitamin D.
3. Colchicine 0.6 grams.
4. Combivent.
5. Compazine.
6. Aspirin.
7. Folic acid.
8. Levothyroxine 75 mcg q day.
9. Percocet.
10. Protonix 40 q day.
11. Vitamin B6 25 q day.
12. Vitamin B1 1 gram q day.

CHEST X-RAY:  Revealed a right pleural effusion with
associated collapse and consolidation at the adjacent line.
A lateral decubitus was obtained showing a free flowing
fluid.  A linear opacity in the upper lung zone representing
pneumonia versus skinfold.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Showed sinus tachycardia at 101 beats per
minute with normal axis and normal intervals.  Q waves were
noted in leads II, III, and aVF, V2, V3.  The Q waves were
new since her electrocardiogram dated [**3433-12-1**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 63-year-old woman with a history
of adenocarcinoma status post bilateral apical lung
resection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and
diabetes mellitus, who presented initially with shortness of
breath, hypoxia, hypertension, increased anion gap, acidosis,
and a troponin leak.  She was admitted to the MICU for
further evaluation.

Pulmonary:  The patient's initial hypoxia attributed to be
multifactorial to include chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, possible pneumonia, and atelectasis due to a large
pleural effusion.  She underwent a thoracentesis.  The
thoracentesis fluid revealed essentially a cellular specimen
composed of predominantly lymphoid cells with some
neutrophils and reactive mesothelial cells.  It also revealed
667 white blood cells, 889 red blood cells, 39% polys, 53%
lymphocytes, 6 monocytes, 1 eosinophil, and 1 basophil.
Total protein was 3.4 with 165 glucose and 145 for a LDH.
The pleural pH was 7.34 and the cultures were negative.

The patient was started up on levofloxacin due to possible
pneumonia.  Her sputum cultures and blood cultures remained
negative throughout her stay.  She also remained on her
inhalers.  Shortly after the thoracentesis, the patient's O2
saturation drastically improved, and the patient's pleural
effusion remained stable throughout the course of her stay.
She did not require intubation, and she was gradually weaned
from the nonrebreather to nasal cannula and eventually on to
room air with satisfactory O2 saturations.

Cardiac:  Patient was initially admitted with hypertension
with a troponin leak of approximately 11 and flat CKs.  A
STAT echocardiogram revealed regional left ventricular wall
motion abnormalities.  Specifically, revealed a mild
anteroseptal wall that was akinetic; mid inferior wall was
akinetic, mild inferolateral wall was akinetic; the mid
anterolateral wall was akinetic; the septal apex wall was
akinetic; the inferior apex was akinetic; the lateral apex
was akinetic; and the apex was akinetic; there is also
moderate tricuspid regurgitation (+2).  Ejection fraction was
estimated to be about 20%.  This showed dramatically
decreased left ventricular function with new wall
abnormalities and the patient was taken emergently to the
cardiac catheterization laboratory for a catheterization.

The catheterization revealed a cardiac output of 3.5, an
index of 2.2, a systemic vascular resistance of 2,034 with a
pulmonary vascular resistance of 320.  Her ejection fraction
was estimated to be about 25%.  The anterolateral apical and
inferior wall were akinetic.  The mid right coronary showed a
50% lesion.  The proximal left anterior descending artery was
with a 40% lesion.  The resting hemodynamic measurements
revealed systemic arterial hypertension which was responsive
to IV dopamine.  Right heart filling pressures were normal.
The wedge was slightly elevated at 17 mm Hg and the left
ventricular end diastolic pressure was 22 mm Hg.  There was
moderate significant pulmonary hypertension.

Following the catheterization, the patient remained on the
dopamine drip for pressure support.  This was gently weaned
over the next two days.  She was then transferred to CMED for
further evaluation for her cardiomyopathy.

The patient had multiple laboratories sent for further
evaluation of her cardiomyopathy.  The results of these
laboratories were still pending at the time of dictation.
Specifically, a negative [**Doctor First Name 99**], a negative rheumatoid factor.
Her TSH was slightly elevated, but she had a normal T4.  She
had a negative hepatitis C antibody.  Her CMV IgG antibody
test was positive.  IgM antibody was negative.  Her
[**Doctor Last Name 954**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus IgG was positive.  The IgM was negative.
Her Lyme serology was negative.

It was thought that her new cardiomyopathy could be
multifactorial.  Most importantly, it could be due to her
poor nutritional status.  It was attempted to add on an ACE
inhibitor while the patient was in-house, but unfortunately,
the blood pressure remained less than 100 systolic and this
was difficult to add on.  She will be followed closely by her
primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] attempt to add this on and
increase the dose.

Hematological:  Patient with an anemia.  Her calculated TIBC
was 146 with a ferritin of 241, and a TRF of 112.  Her
hematocrit was normal in the low 30s.  She did consent to
blood transfusions after having the risks explained to her
and she did receive a total of 2 units of packed red blood
cells throughout her stay.  It was thought that her anemia
could be due to her poor nutritional status and her chronic
disease.  She was started up on multivitamins, folate, and
iron supplements.  She will continue to have this followed up
with her primary care physician.

Endocrine:  Patient with a history of hypothyroidism.  Her
TSH was elevated at 6.8.  Her T4 was in the low normal range.
Most difficult, however, was controlling her diabetes.
Initially when she came in, she had an anion gap acidosis,
which was initially thought to be possible diabetic
ketoacidosis.  She was given insulin in the Emergency Room
along with an IV insulin drip and IV fluids.  The anion gap
which was 21 eventually closed and the patient was switched
over to her home regimen of NPH and regular insulin-sliding
scale.

The patient had several episodes of hypoglycemia, and her NPH
was reduced.  Following reduction of her NPH, the patient
experienced several episodes of severe hyperglycemia of
approximately 400.  This patient is a former employee at
[**Last Name (un) 720**] and is followed there.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 720**] consult was obtained
to assist with the management of this difficult patient.
Further education was provided along with a reasonable NPH
and regular insulin scale.  Patient was to followup with her
[**Last Name (un) 720**] attending in 1-2 weeks for further adjustment.  It is
anticipated that the patient will continue to have some
hyperglycemia in lieu of the fact that she will be receiving
tube feeds at night due to her poor nutritional status.

Infectious disease:  The patient was empirically started on
levofloxacin for possible pneumonia.  She completed a 10 day
course of levofloxacin.  A urinalysis revealed patient had a
yeast infection and was given a dose of Diflucan.

Nutrition:  The patient was seen by the nutritional consult
service for further evaluation.  A calorie count was
performed and it was deemed that the patient should have a
nasogastric tube placed and receive supplemental nutrition at
night.  Her primary care physician had noted that she had a
significant weight loss in the past year with a thorough
oncological workup was performed given her history of lung
cancer on an outpatient basis, which yielded no clear source.
The patient was also started up on Remeron for her depression
and appetite stimulant.  She was also given Reglan with all
of her meals.

Over the course of her stay on the CMED service, her appetite
gradually improved.  She was sent home with a nasogastric
tube placed and was to have cyclic supplements at night.  She
is still encouraged to take as much po intake as possible.

Psychological:  Patient was depressed and she was started on
Remeron.  Her mood and affect were flat through most of her
stay.  It is recommended that she seek an outpatient
assistance for her depression, but the patient appeared
reluctant.  She expressed no suicidal ideation or homicidal
ideation.

Musculoskeletal:  The patient presented with severe
deconditioning.  She was seen by the Physical Therapy team,
who thought that the patient could be discharged home.  Of
note, it was thought by many people on her healthcare team
that the patient should go to a rehabilitation home to
improve her status, but she was resistant to such efforts.

     right pleural effusion.
     
     COMPARISON: [**3433-12-19**]
     
     AP PORTABLE CHEST:  In the interval since the prior study, there is marked
     increase in the size of the right pleural effusion with associated collapse
     and consolidation of the adjacent right lower and right middle lobes.  The
     left lung is clear and there is no left pleural effusion.  The cardiac
     silhouette is within normal limits.  The hila are retracted superiorly which
     is unchanged, consistent with prior bilateral upper lobectomies.  Biapical
     pleural thickening is stable.  There is no upper zone redistribution of the
     pulmonary vasculature and no definite nodules or masses.
     
     IMPRESSION: Increased right pleural effusion with associated collapse and
     consolidation of the adjacent lung.  A new mass lesion could obscured by these
     findings in the right lung.  The opacified lung could represent atelectasis
     aasociated with effusion, but an infectious process cannot be excluded.

     pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  A surgical
     clip is noted to the left of the upper mediastinum.  Slight increased density
     at the left base is likely related to technique.  The appearance of the lungs
     is otherwise unchanged in the interval.
     
     IMPRESSION: Decrease in size of right pleural effusion without evident
     pneumothorax.

     INDICATION: Rule out pneumothorax right sided pleural effusion.
     
     COMMENT: Portable AP radiograph of the chest is reviewed, and compared with
     the previous study of yesterday.
     
     There is continued moderate sized right pleural effusion as well as increased
     small left pleural effusion. Patchy atelectasis is seen in both lower lobes.
     
     The previously identified Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed. There is no
     pneumothorax. The heart is normal in size. Again note is made of tortuousity
     of the thoracic aorta. Again note is made of marked reduction of the lung
     volumes in apices due to post surgical changes and radiation.

     Comparison is made to previous films from [**3434-6-14**].
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST:    Allowing for technical differences, there is no change
     seen since prior exam. Again noted is elevation of both pulmonary hilar
     secondary to prior bilateral upper lobe lobectomies. There is again bilateral
     pleural effusions, right greater than left. The cardiomediastinal borders are
     unchanged.  No pneumothorax is seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions, stable  since prior exam of [**3434-6-14**].

     position.
     
     Comparison is made to the prior examination of [**3434-6-16**].
     
     FINDINGS:  A newly inserted NG tube is identified with its tip coiled in the
     stomach, seen to head caudate in direction.  There is no pneumothorax. The
     cardiomediastinal borders are unchanged.  There is bilateral elevation of the
     hila with evidence of medial radiation fibrotic changes, consistent with
     treatment for the patient's known lung cancer (there is also questionable
     history of prior upper lobe lobectomies).  As before, there are bilateral
     pleural effusions, right greater than left, along with associated atelectasis
     of the right lower lobe.  These findings are unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:  NG tube seen coiled on itself within the stomach, with its tip
     heading caudate.  Otherwise stable appearance.

     INDICATION:  COPD with right pleural effusion.  Follow-up for right effusion.
     
     Comparison is made to the prior examination of [**3434-6-18**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal borders are unchanged.  Bilateral elevation
     of the hila and medial radiation fibrotic changes for the treatment of the
     patient's known lung cancer are again noted.  There has reportedly been prior
     upper lobe lobectomies in the past.
     
     Comparison with the prior exam demonstrates a better inspiratory effort with
     clearing of left sided pleural effusion.  Accounting for better inspiratory
     effort, a right sided pleural effusion is likely unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
     
     
     IMPRESSION:  Improved inspiratory effort with resolution of left sided
     effusion.  Probably no change to right sided pleural effusion.

     HISTORY:  Lymphocytic effusion, question of malignancy.
     
     CT TECHNIQUE:  CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed.  No
     intravenous contrast was administered due to known allergy.  The patient
     recieved oral contrast.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST:
     
     FINDINGS:  This study read in conjunction with the prior CT of the chest dated
     [**3433-4-2**].  Again seen are findings which would be most consistent with
     mediastinal radiation including some traction bronchiectasis and paratracheal
     thickening at the right apex.  This appears unchanged.  There is a moderate-
     sized free layering right-sided pleural effusion with associated
     atelectasis/collapse of the lower lung, also previously known.  No distinct
     hilar adenopathy.  The visualized lung parenchyma shows no definite mass
     lesions.

     FINDINGS:  This study is read in conjuction with the prior exam of [**3433-4-6**].
     The liver appears unremarkable.  There are simple bilateral renal cysts.  The
     pancreas is mildly atrophic, the patient is status post cholecystectomy.
     There is no free fluid in the abdomen, no distinct adenopathy is appreciated.
     There is atherosclerotic changes involving the abdominal aorta.

     FINDINGS:  The visualized loops of small and large bowel appear normal.  No
     definite free fluid, no adenopathy is appreciated, no mass lesions.  Beam
     hardening obscures the bladder region (secondary to left hip replacement).

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Short of breath, slight fever, high white count, please evaluate
     for pneumonia.
     
     VIEWS:  PA and lateral views, comparison dated [**3434-7-4**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The heart size is unchanged and within normal limits.  No pulmonary
     vascular congestion.  Again noted is biapical pleural thickening and scar
     formation, with marked cranial displacement of the hila bilaterally,
     consistent with prior radiation treatment.  No radiologic evidence of surgical
     entrance into the thorax.  There may be slight prominence of the right hilum
     compared to the prior study.  Decreased aeration of the right lung compared to
     the prior study may relate to poor inspiratory effort.  Blunting of the right
     costophrenic angle with obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm is consistent
     with previously seen right pleural effusion.  Increase in size of the right
     pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  Bilateral emphysematous change again
     noted.  No new areas of focal consolidation.  No pneumothorax.  The visualized
     osseous structures are unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Decreased aeration of right lung likely relates to poor inspiratory effort,
     although increasing right pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
     
     2) Possible slight increased prominence of right hilum compared to prior study
     of [**7-4**].  More precise assessment of this area could be attained with a CT
     of the thorax.
     
     3) Emphysema.
     
     4) Stable appearance of biapical chronic changes consistent with prior
     radiation therapy.
     
     5) No acute parenchymal infiltrates to suggest pneumonia.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      64 year old woman recurring episodes of SOB. Has RML syndrome and recurrent 
      right effusions. Found to have tracheobronchiomalacia on bronch. 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Is there any tracheobronchiomalacia as suggested by awake bronch.               
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CT TRACHEA:
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Recurrent episodes of SOB.  Known right middle lobe
     syndrome and recurrent right pleural effusions.  Evaluate for
     tracheobronchomalacia.
     
     Comparison is made to prior CTA of the chest dated 3 days earlier.
     
     Helical CT of the central airways was performed without intravenous or oral
     contrast administration.  Images were initially acquired using a standard dose
     technique at inspiration.  Subsequently, during dynamic expiratory phase of
     respiration, images were acquired using a low dose technique.
     
     Despite respiratory maneuver instructions and coaching of the patient, the
     patient was unable to cooperate with breathing instructions for dynamic
     expiratory phase of respiration.  This precludes the ability to evaluate for
     tracheobronchomalacia.
     
     Assessment of the central airways reveals distortion of the lower trachea,
     carcina and central right bronchi likely related to previous surgery and
     radiation.  The posterior wall of the right main stem bronchus and bronchus
     intermedius as well as right lower lobe bronchus all appear extensively
     thickened and the right lower lobe bronchus has a very high grade area of
     narrowing just proximal to the origin of the segmental branches.  The lumen
     narrows to approximately 2 mm in diameter.  The right middle lobe bronchi are
     extremely narrowed at their origin and there is associated collapse of the
     right middle lobe.  The segmental bronchi to the right lower lobe all appear
     patent.
     
     Soft tissue structures demonstrate the presence of a moderate sized dependent
     right pleural effusion which has decreased in size compared to the recent CTA
     study of 3 days earlier.  There is only a trace amount of pleural effusion on
     the left.  Bilateral central mediastinal radiation fibrosis is noted and is
     without change since the very recent study.
     
     Note is made of the presence of emphysema.
     
     Skeletal structures demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic skeletal
     lesions.  Note is made of previous sternotomy.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     Finally, note is made of surgical clips in the left hilar region.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Technically non-diagnostic study for tracheobronchomalacia due to
     patient's inability to cooperate with dynamic breathing instructions.  The
     dynamic expiratory phase of imaging will be repeated at no additional charge
     to the patient. The repeat exam has been scheduled and an addendum will be
     issued to the report when it is completed.
     
     2)  Unusual appearance of central airways in the right lung which correspond
     to an operative report of bronchoscopic findings from approximately 1 year
     ago.  This includes abnormal thickening of the posterior wall of the central
     bronchi on the right as well as high grade luminal narrowing of the right
     lower lobe bronchus proximal to the origin of the segmental bronchi appear
     patent.  There is also very high grade narrowing of the origin of the middle
     lobe bronchi with associated middle lobe collapse. This is most likely due to
     post-radiation and post- operative change, particularly as the right lower
     lobe bronchus has a similar configuration on an older chest CT of 3/2002.
     
     3)  Moderate sized right pleural effusion which is decreased in size compared
     to recent CTA of 3 days earlier.
     
     4)  Post-radiation changes appear stable.
     
     5)  When available, multiplanar and 3D images will be reviewed and an addendum
     can be issued to the report at that time.

     chest tubes and a right IJ central venous line are unchanged in position.
     There has been interval re-expansion of the right lung, though there remains a
     moderate sized circumferential pneumothorax.  There continues to be increased
     density medially within the right lung which probably relates to volume loss
     or postoperative changes. The left lung remains clear.  There is stable
     biapical pleural thickening.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Decrease in size of right-sided pneumothorax.  Interval

Briefly, this is a 63 year old female with a history of IDDM,CHF,COPD,lung CA, S/P post bilateral upper lobe lobectomies in [**3426**],hypothyroidism,CAD,and chronic pleural effusions who presented
with SOB.  Complete workup was done at an OSH an severe tracheobrochomalacia and right middle lobe syndrome was diagnosed(recurrent pleural effusions).
[**3434-10-1**] pt underwent a right middle lobe lobectomy,carinoplasty,tracheoplasty and right brochoplasty and transferred to CSRU on [**3434-10-2**] from PACU.
Arrived on face tent at 50% speaking in 3-4 word sentences in a hoarse voice. Trachae midline. Cap refill WNL. (2) Right chest tubes to suction. Dressing reinforced X 1. No crepitus palpated. L/S-coarse and diminished. Aggressive pulmonary toileting. Compliant with IS and coughing and deep breathing. Neo for BP to keep MAP >60. See CareVue for dosing.
G-tube PTA for weight loss and receives tube feeding at home.
Epidural catheter in place for pain-hydromorphone and bip. [**Name8 (MD) **] MD up to evaluate pt X 2 for C/O pain by pt. Received 5 cc bolus which finally gave pt relief from [**4-24**] to 0/10. Currently, epidural infusing at 12cc's/hr.  Slight bleeding around insertion site. [**Name8 (MD) **] MD aware and catheter was changed today and bleeding to be expected.
Daughters in and updated on POC. 
Plan: Maintain MAP>60 and titrate neo accordingly,pain control with epidural,SSRI per FSBS,aggressive pulmonary toileting,OOB ASAP,
check with MD about results of PCXR(? need for lasix) and support pt and family.
See CareVue for additional objective data.

     A tracheostoy is in place. Two right-sided chest tubes are present. A right IJ
     central line is present, though the tip is obscured by overlying structures.
     This probably overlies the right atrium. There is volume loss in the right
     lung, with pleural thickening and/or fluid. In addition, there is a
     pneumothorax at the right apex, outlined by some right apical pleural
     thickening. Left apical pleural thickening is also present. There is increased
     retrocardiac density, consistent with collapse and/or consolidation. There are
     diffusely increased interstitial markings, more prominent in the right lung
     but also present on the left.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Right-sided pneumothorax probably slightly larger than one day
     earlier. Hilum obscured with surrounding opacity.

     PORTABLE CHEST
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION: Elevated white blood cell count.  Evaluate for pulmonary
     infection.
     
     Comparison is made to previous study of two days earlier.
     
     Two chest tubes remain in place in the right hemithorax.  There is a
     persistent right hydropneumothorax.  The basilar component of the pneumothorax
     has decreased in the interval and the apical component is essentially stable
     allowing for differences in positioning.  Tracheostomy tube remains in place.
     Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable with geographically marginated
     opacities adjacent to the upper mediastinum and hila, likely reflecting prior
     radiation change.  There is also upper displacement of the pulmonary hila
     consistent with upper lobe volume loss.  A small right pleural effusion and
     minor bibasilar atelectasis are unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Right hydropneumothorax with stable apical component of pneumothorax but
     interval improvement in degree of basilar component of pneumothorax.
     
     2) Persistent bibasilar opacities, patchy at the right base and linear at the
     left base, most likely due to atelectasis.  Underlying infection in the right
     base is not fully excluded but this finding is stable in the post operative
     period.

     PORTABLE CHEST, [**3434-10-15**]
     
     Compared to a previous study of [**3434-10-14**].
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Elevated white blood cell count.
     
     A tracheostomy tube and two right-sided chest tubes remain in place.  There
     remains apical pleural fluid versus thickening on the right.  The cardiac and
     mediastinal contours are stable.  A small amount of pleural fluid is noted at
     the right base and there is persistent patchy and linear opacity in this
     region.  Minimal linear opacities noted at the left base and no left pleural
     effusion is identified.
     
     Hazy increased opacity at the right apex is noted between the visceral pleural
     margin and an area of apical pleural thickening.  This could potentially
     represent a small area of hydropneumothorax without a discernible fluid level
     if the patient is not in a fully upright position.  This appears unchanged
     since the recent studies.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Stable radiographic appearance of the chest compared to previous
     study of one day earlier.  Right basilar lung opacities favor atelectasis
     considering recent wedge resection in this region, but an infectious process
     cannot be fully excluded.

     INDICATION: Request to place a single lumen line in a 64 year old woman who
     needs blood draws. Failed PICC line placement at bedside by IV team.
     
     PHYSICIAN: [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 527**]. [**First Name (STitle) 262**] [**Name (STitle) 263**] d'Othee, staff radiologist, performed the entire
     procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: The patient was placed supine on the angiography table and
     her right arm was sterilely draped and prepped as usually. No veins were
     accessible clinically. Therefore, a focused ultrasound examination was
     performed and showed a patent, fully compressible right basilic vein. This
     vein was punctured under real time ultrasound guidance with a 21 gauge needle.
     An 0.018 wire was avdanced through the needle under fluoroscopic guidance to
     the superior vena cava (SVC). The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture
     sheath. A measurement was taken with a wire and a 4 French, single lumen PICC
     line was trimmed to a length of 45 cm. The PICC line was advanced over the
     wire until its tip reached the SVC-right atrium junction. An X-ray was taken
     and confirmed correct line positioning, with its tip at the level of the lower
     SVC. A StatLock and a sterile dressing were placed. There were no immediate
     complications.
     
     CONCLUSION: Placement of a 45 cm long, 4 French, single lumen PICC line from
     the right basilic vein to the junction of the SVC with the right atrium. The
     PICC is ready for immediate use.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      64 year old woman with                                                          
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      place double lumen PICC                                                         
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Request to place a single lumen line in a 64 year old woman who
     needs blood draws. Failed PICC line placement at bedside by IV team.
     
     PHYSICIAN: [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 527**]. [**First Name (STitle) 262**] [**Name (STitle) 263**] d'Othee, staff radiologist, performed the entire
     procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: The patient was placed supine on the angiography table and
     her right arm was sterilely draped and prepped as usually. No veins were
     accessible clinically. Therefore, a focused ultrasound examination was
     performed and showed a patent, fully compressible right basilic vein. This
     vein was punctured under real time ultrasound guidance with a 21 gauge needle.
     An 0.018 wire was avdanced through the needle under fluoroscopic guidance to
     the superior vena cava (SVC). The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture
     sheath. A measurement was taken with a wire and a 4 French, single lumen PICC
     line was trimmed to a length of 45 cm. The PICC line was advanced over the
     wire until its tip reached the SVC-right atrium junction. An X-ray was taken
     and confirmed correct line positioning, with its tip at the level of the lower
     SVC. A StatLock and a sterile dressing were placed. There were no immediate
     complications.
     
     CONCLUSION: Placement of a 45 cm long, 4 French, single lumen PICC line from
     the right basilic vein to the junction of the SVC with the right atrium. The
     PICC is ready for immediate use.

     INDICATION:  Rising white count.
     
     PORTABLE CHEST: Comparison is made to prior study of one day earlier. The
     tracheostomy and central venous catheter are stable in position (catheter tip
     in right atrium). Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Pleural fluid
     in both apices without significant change. Patchy infiltrates are again noted
     in both lung bases. The left base is without change, although there may be
     some worsened aeration at the right base. There are findings compatible with a
     small right pleural effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION: Possible worsening of aeration at the right base compared to
     yesterday. Otherwise, unchanged.
     
     ADDENDUM:  An air collection projecting over the right apex, in the region of
     presumed pleural fluid, demonstrates no vascular markings, suggesting 
     there is a loculated hydropneumothorax here.
