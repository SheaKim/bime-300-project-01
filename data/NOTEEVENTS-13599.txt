     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      70 year old man with                                                            
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      s/p fall                                                                        
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Fall one week ago, now in brace.  Check alignment in patient with
     known fracture.
     
     CERVICAL SPINE, 3 VIEWS.
     
     On the lateral view, C2 through C6/7 disc space is demonstrated.  Portions of
     the bones are obscured by the patient's brace.  Cervical lordosis is
     preserved.  ?minimal anterolisthesis of C5 on C6.  There is splaying of the
     C6/7 spinous processes. Congruence of the facets at C6/7 is difficult to
     confirm on these views.  Vertebral body heights are preserved.  No
     prevertebral soft tissue swelling is seen.  The known fractures are not
     optimally demonstrated radiographically.  The AP view suggests abnormal
     widening of the articulation of the left C6 and C7 articular masses, with
     slight left convex curvature centered at this level, with the patient in the
     brace.  A swimmer's view was obtained, but levels are difficult to assign.  In
     addition, detail is obscured by the overlying shoulder girdle.
     
     IMPRESSION: Abnormal widening of the left C6/7 lateral masses and splaying of
     C6/7 spinous processes.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  C7 fracture, rule out instability.
     
     Non-contrast CT of the cervical spine with multiplanar reformatted images.
     
     Exam is compared to prior study of [**2825-2-12**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of change in alignment compared to the
     previous examination.  The fracture line through the facet joint and pars
     interarticularis of C7 on the right is identified and is slightly more evident
     than the previous examination consistent with evolutionary healing.  There is
     some irregularity of the posterior aspect of the foramen transversarium on the
     same side which probably also represents some fracture deformity also better
     visualized than on previous exam.  A slightly displaced fracture of the
     posterior aspect of the foramen transversarium on the left side is more
     evident than the previous examination.  The degree of displacement is
     unchanged.  There are no definite new findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Fracture through the right articulating facet and pars
     interarticularis, the posterior aspect of the foramen transversarium, and the
     left foramen transversarium are slightly better displayed than the previous
     examination.  There is no alteration in alignment.

     CHEST, FOUR VIEWS:
     
     The patient is status post CABG.  Clips are also noted in the region of the GE
     junction. The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened
     consistent with COPD.  The heart is not enlarged; the aorta is unfolded. There
     is bibasilar atelectasis, including atelectasis in the right middle lobe,
     which is unchanged compared with [**2825-2-12**]. There are no pleural effusions,
     pneumothoraces, pulmonary vascular congestion, or consolidations. There is
     evidence of widening of the C6-C7 facet joint on the left.  Ossification of
     thoracic spine anteriorlongitudinal ligament noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) No acute pulmonary process. COPD and persistent RML atelectasis.
     
     ADDENDUM: 2) In light of the COPD and  persistent RML atelectasis, compared
     with remote prior CXR (none on pacs record) is recommended. In the absence of
     that, Chest CT is recommended to exclude airway pathology.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Diabetes and history of CABG in [**2799**].  Now pre-op for cervical spine 
     fusion. 
      
     SUMMARY OF THE PRELIMINARY REPORT FROM THE EXERCISE LAB: 
      
     Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a  dose of 0.142 
     milligram/kilogram/min. Two minutes after the cessation of infusion, Tc-99m
     sestamibi was administered IV.   No symptoms or EKG changes were noted during
     infusion. 
      
     INTERPRETATION: 
     Image Protocol: Gated SPECT 
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium. 
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images. 
     This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model. 
      
     The image quality is adequate, although slightly limited by patient arm
     position. 
      
     Left ventricular cavity size is normal. 
      
     Resting and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout  the
     myocardium. 
      
     Gated images reveal focal hypokinesis of the septum, consistent with history of
     prior CABG. 
      
     The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 52%. 
      
     No prior studies are available for comparison. 
      
     IMPRESSION: 
     Normal myocardial perfusion.  EF 52%.

PATHOLOGY 
[**4-4**]: no evid on osteonecrosis or osteomyelitis
.
Recent Imaging:
[**2825-5-6**]: CXR - A dual-lumen right subclavian dialysis catheter 
and left subclavian central line remain with tips projecting 
over the junction of the brachiocephalics with the SVC. 
Following extubation, there remains small-to- moderate bilateral 
pleural effusions with associated bibasilar atelectasis. The 
upper lungs are clear. The heart is normal size and mediastinal 
contours are unchanged. No pneumothorax.
[**2825-5-3**]: MRI head - Slow diffusion in the left occipital lobe 
with subtle enhancement, these findings would indicate subacute 
infarct. Diffuse increased signal in the sulci and fluid-fluid 
levels in the occipital horns of both lateral ventricles are 
indicative of proteinaceous material within the CSF spaces and 
correlation with lumbar puncture is recommended to exclude 
infection. Diffuse soft tissue changes are seen in both mastoid 
air cells.
[**2825-5-3**]: MRI C-spine - Since the previous MRI examination, the 
fluid at the laminectomy site has decreased. There is slight 
deformity of the spinal cord seen, which could be secondary to 
focal adhesions, which is more pronounced since the previous 
study. Subtle increased signal suspected within the spinal cord 
at C7 level could be due to myelomalacia, but could not be 
confirmed on the axial images. The previously seen 
leptomeningeal enhancement has decreased. No evidence of 
discitis or osteomyelitis is seen. Followup is recommended.
TTE [**4-28**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular 
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate 
to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. Right ventricular 
chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis. 
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no 
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is 
no pericardial effusion.  IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe global 
left ventricular hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, 
metabolic, etc.) Mild mitral regurgitation. 
[**4-28**]: RUQ US - 1. No intrahepatic biliary dilatation. 7-mm CBD 
with no intraductal filling defect demonstrated.
2. Moderately distended gallbladder containing sludge. This 
appearance can commonly be seen in the ICU setting. The 
ossibility of acute cholecystitis cannot be excluded with this 
appearance. If there is strong clinical concern for this, then 
further correlation with HIDA scan should be considered. 
[**2825-4-28**]: MR L spine: 1. Disc herniation noted at the level of 
L4-5 and L5-S1 as described above.
2. Findings suspicious for discitis at L5-S1 and possibly at 
L4-5.
3. No definite drainable epidural abscess noted.
[**2825-4-18**]: CTA - 1. Non-occlusive filling defect in the distal end 
of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery and small area in one 
of its subsegmental branches, consistent with pulmonary embolus.
[**2825-4-18**]: CT abd/pel - 1. No intra-abdominal or pelvic cause for 
sepsis demonstrated.
2. At present the inflated balloon of the urinary catheter lies 
at the level of the prostate gland rather than within the 
bladder and needs to be deflated and advanced.
3. An 8 to 9 mm hypodensity in the posterior aspect of the 
proximal pancreatic body is indeterminate but may represent a 
small cystic area. This could be followed up with interval 
imaging. A 1-cm hypodensity in segment VII of the liver 
unchanged. Several subcentimeter renal cortical hypodensities 
are too small to characterize but likely small cysts.

[**2825-4-16**]: CXR portable IMPRESSION: Improving right lower lobe 
pneumonia.
[**2825-4-14**]: CT Cspine There is left lateral fusion at C6-C7 via 
pedicle screws and a spinal rod. There has also been laminectomy 
from C6 and C7. There are surgical skin staples seen 
posteriorly. Paravertebral soft tissues are within normal 
limits. There are no signs for acute fractures. 
[**2825-4-1**]: PROCEDURE: Under fluoroscopic guidance and aseptic 
technique, a 16 gauge needle was introduced at the C5 level via 
a posterior mid-line approach. Approximately 25 ml of lightly 
blood stained, straw-colored fluid was aspiration. A sample of 
the fluid was sent for various microbiological and biochemical 
analysis, as requested. No immediate complications were 
encountered. 
[**2825-3-30**]: MRI C spine: COMPARISON STUDY: [**2825-3-22**] 
cervical spine MR imaging. 
Comparison with the prior study reveals persistent extensive 
posterior fluid within both the interspinous and paraspinous 
soft tissues. There is persistent, moderately longitudinally 
extensive epidural enhancement spanning the area of the 
laminectomy, with a mild degree of associated compression of the 
spinal cord along its dorsal surface. While the finding could 
represent postoperative changes, a superimposed epidural 
infection cannot be excluded. 
Similarly, it is not possible to tell whether the extensive 
paraspinous and interspinous fluid is either sterile or 
infected, either. There may be a slight quantity of prevertebral 
soft tissue swelling at this time. There is no sign of abnormal 
T2 signal either within the vertebral bodies or intervertebral 
disc spaces to suggest osteomyelitis or discitis, respectively. 
[**2825-3-30**]: MRI brain with contrast: 
CONCLUSION: Unusual tiny areas of high signal on 
diffusion-weighted imaging within the occipital horns of the 
lateral ventricles, more evident on the left side. The findings 
could represent the effects of known meningeal infection and/or 
subarachnoid hemorrhage. Other findings as noted above. 
[**2825-3-30**]: Portable CXR: FINDINGS: The extreme left CP angle is off 
the film but the majority of the lungs are clear with improved 
aeration in the left lower lobe. Patient is status post median 
sternotomy with mediastinal clips. Surgical staples are seen 
projecting over the cervical spine with the plate overlying the 
lateral masses of the lower cervical spine. NG tube tip is in 
the stomach. The endotracheal tube has been removed.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2825-5-26**] 5:51 PM
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST

Reason: Please evaluate for interval worsening pulmonary 
process. 

INDICATION: Recent MRSA meningitis, PE, nosocomial pneumonia 
with spiking fevers. Evaluate for worsening pulmonary process.
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Compared to the prior 
study, the previously seen left lower lobe consolidation appears 
smaller. There is still evidence of consolidation with air 
bronchograms, consistent with pneumonia in the left lower lobe . 
Patchy airspace opacity is also again seen in the dependent 
portion of right lower lung, slightly decreased from prior 
study, again possibly representing a small infectious source or 
atelectasis.

Again seen are multiple mediastinal and axillary lymph[**MD Number 285**] 
that do not appear to meet CT criteria for pathological 
enlargement, unchanged from prior study. Coronary artery 
calcification appears unchanged. There has been mild decrease in 
the previously seen pleural effusions.

Limited views of the upper abdomen are not significantly changed 
from prior study. Again seen is a gastrostomy tube. 
Calcification is again noted within the pancreas. Small amount 
of fluid again seen surrounding the spleen. Hypodensity in the 
right lobe of the liver appears unchanged.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are 
identified.

IMPRESSION:
Interval decrease in size of left lower lobe consolidation. Air 
bronchograms and consolidations are still seen, consistent with 
pneumonia. Small parenchymal airspace opacity again seen in the 
right lower lobe, possibly representing atelectasis or small 
focus of infection. Otherwise, no significant change from prior 
study.

US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN  [**2825-5-27**] 12:40 PM

CLINICAL DETAILS: Elevated alkaline phosphatase, fever. Evaluate 
gallbladder.

Comparison is made to previous imaging.

FINDINGS: 

The liver is normal in size and echogenicity, no focal lesions. 
No intra or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The CBD measures 
less than 4 mm in diameter.

Sludge within the dependent portion of the moderately 
gallbladder(less distended than previous scan of [**2825-4-26**]). No 
gallstones, gallbladder wall measures up to 3mm.

Right kidney appears normal, no hydronephrosis. No free upper 
abdominal fluid.

CONCLUSION:

1) Moderately distended sludge-filled gallbladder. Appearance is 
similar to the recent ultrasound of [**2825-4-28**]. No biliary 
dilatation. Further evaluation with HIDA scan could be 
considered if cholecystitis remains a concern.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2825-5-29**] 4:01 PM

INDICATION: 70-year-old with multiple medical problems; 
pneumonia complicated by MRSA, meningitis, PE, and fungemia. 
Please evaluate for liver or spleen pathology.

COMPARISONS: CT chest of [**2825-5-17**] and CT abdomen of [**2825-4-18**].
TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images through the chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis without IV contrast.

CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Persisting left lower lobe 
consolidation with small bilateral pleural effusions, greater on 
the left. The patient is status post CABG with coronary artery 
calcifications. The airway is patent to the segmental level.

CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Moderately distended gallbladder 
with layering sludge/stones. The abdominal and pelvic viscera 
are not well evaluated without IV contrast. Small hypodense 
lesions in the kidneys, most likely simple cyst, but not 
characterized on this study. Small nonobstructing left renal 
calculus. G-tube appears well positioned. Multiple subcentimeter 
retroperitoneal nodes, none pathologically enlarged by strict CT 
criteria. Pancreatic parenchymal calcifications likely the 
sequela of chronic pancreatitis.

CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are large acute to subacute 
hematomas within the iliac muscles bilaterally and left psoas 
muscle. Rectum, sigmoid are unremarkable. Foley catheter in a 
nondistended bladder. Incidental note made of penile implant 
with intrapelvic reservoir.

BONE WINDOWS: Lytic lesions involving the iliac bones 
bilaterally, likely site of prior bone graft harvest. Diffuse 
degenerative changes without other suspicious lytic or blastic 
lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1) Large acute to subacute bilateral iliacus and left psoas 
muscle hematomas. Superimposed infection not excluded.
2) Liver and spleen suboptimally evaluated with out IV contrast.
3) Left lower lobe consolidation with small bilateral pleural 
effusions.
4) Moderately distended sludge filled gallbladder.
5) Subcentimeter retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
6) Nonobstructing 7 mm left renal calculus.
7) Pancreatic parenchymal calcifications likely the sequela of 
chronic pancreatitis.
8) Lytic lesions in the iliac bones, likely the site of prior 
bone graft harvest.

Echocardiogram
Conclusions:  
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left 
ventricular  
systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.  
2. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.  
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.  
4. No clear evidence of endocarditis seen.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2825-6-3**] 12:54 PM
INDICATION: 70-year-old with multiple medical problems, MRSA 
pneumonia, fungemia, followup iliacus and psoas hematomas.

COMPARISONS: CT torso of [**2825-5-29**] and CT torso of [**2825-4-18**].
TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images through the abdomen and pelvis with 
oral but without IV contrast.

CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Persisting left lower lobe 
consolidation with small stable bilateral pleural effusions. 
Within the left lower lobe consolidation, there is a linear 
hyperdensity, which was present on multiple prior CTs but 
appears more prominent on the current study. This may represent 
a calcified granuloma with adjacent streak artifact though, it 
is difficult to further characterize. Coronary artery 
calcification. Moderately-distended gallbladder with dependent 
sludge. G-tube appears well positioned. Ill- defined hypodense 
lesions in the right lobe of the liver and kidneys are not well 
characterized on this non-contrast study. Diffuse pancreatic 
parenchymal calcifications likely the sequela of chronic 
pancreatitis.

CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Stable size and appearance of 
hematomas involving the iliacus muscles bilaterally and the left 
psoas muscle. These are unchanged from [**2825-5-29**]. Foley catheter in 
the non-distended bladder. Incidental note made of penile 
prosthetic with indwelling reservoir. Lytic lesions involving 
the iliac bones bilaterally represent sites of prior bone graft 
harvest.

IMPRESSION:
1) Stable bilateral iliacus and left psoas hematomas.
2) Persisting left lower lobe consolidation with small bilateral 
pleural effusions.
3) Curvilinear hyperdensity in the left lower lobe, possibly 
representing a calcified granuloma with adjacent artifact, 
though difficult to characterize further. This was present on 
prior CTs, however, appears more prominent on the current study.
4) Moderately distended sludge-filled gallbladder.
5) Limited evaluation of the abdominal and pelvic viscera 
without IV contrast.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2825-6-3**] 12:53 PM

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
70 year old man with CAD, DM s/p fall complicated by c7 fx, 
complicated course including MRSA meningitis, CSF leak, MRSA 
PNA, PE on heparine, Acute renal failure, who is still 
encephalopathic. he had positive fungal Blood Cx about 6 days 
ago. Labs slowly improving but persistently confused. 
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT.

Exam is compared to prior study of [**2825-5-14**].

FINDINGS: The exam is somewhat motion limited. Especially in the 
middle portion of the study, there is no definite evidence of 
mass effect or hemorrhage. Ventricles and sulci remain moderate 
mildly prominent consistent with mild brain atrophy. The 
paranasal sinuses are incompletely visualized but there is some 
soft tissue thickening in the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses. 
This was true to on the previous examination.

IMPRESSION: Somewhat motion limited study. No evidence of acute 
mass or hemorrhage.
.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Pt is a 70yM with h/o CAD status post fall on 
[**2825-2-12**] with R C7 fx s/p ORIF and laminectomy with fusion on 
[**2825-3-5**] admitted to the SICU on [**3-21**] with sepsis.  His present 
illness began on [**2-12**] when he fell down the stairs fracturing C7 
vertebrae, he was admitted, underwent extensive workup, and was 
finally discharged [**2825-2-15**] with a brace.  The pt was then 
followed up in Neurosurgery clinic on [**3-3**] and found to have left 
arm weakness, with likely C6-C7 instability.  The pt was 
admitted that day to NSGY service, and underwent ORIF C6-7 
fracture, laminectomy C6-7 posterior fusion and iliac crest bone 
graft with wire placement. His post op course was c/b ARF (which 
resolved w/ IVF and holding ACEI), UTI tx with cipro.  He was 
discharged on [**3-12**] and did well until [**3-21**] when he developed 
[**11-4**] posterior neck pain with N/V.  He was brought to [**Hospital1 19**] ED 
where he was found to have C spine MRI which revealed a 
posterior fluid collection from C2 to T1 without evidence of 
epidural abscess, intraspinal fluid collection or cord 
compression.  He was treated with IV Vanco and CTX.  He spiked 
to 103.6.  He then underwent cervical wound exploration repair 
of CSF leak, removal of C5 spinous process, removal of wires and 
dural autograft.  
.
LP done [**3-23**] consistent with bacterial meningitis complicating 
the wound infection and CSF leak.  Pt was started on 
Vanco/Ceftazidime with cervical swab [**3-22**] and [**3-26**] growing MRSA. 
He was taken to OR on [**3-25**] for washout with hardware exchange.  
Flagyl 500mg po q8h was added to his regimen of Ceftaz/Vanco on 
[**2825-3-26**]. Ceftaz was continued b/c the pt had ongoing temps and ID 
wanted the pt to be covered broadly until finalization of all 
cxs.  The pt also had a CXR [**3-26**] showing LLL PNA, sputum growing 
out MRSA.  The pt was extubated [**3-28**], and Ceftaz and Flagyl were 
d/c'd [**3-28**], with Acyclovir IV 5mg/kg q8h being started for 
perioral HSV. The pt developed confusion on [**2825-3-29**].  Neurology 
was consulted and recommended MRI/MRA brain, repeat LP w/ HSV 
PCR, echo, and eventually pt was dx with encephalopathy [**2-27**] 
infection/metabolic.  MRI/A of the brain showed new signal in 
occipital horns, infection vs. SAH, and MRI Cspine showed 
persistent, extensive fluid collection in the intra/paraspinous 
soft tissues, persistent epidural enhancement, mild sc 
compression along the posterior surface.  LP was attempted [**3-31**] 
--unsuccessful, so LP under fluoro was performed [**2825-4-1**] as well 
as drainage of C spine fluid collection.  At this pt, the pt was 
on Vancomycin IV and Acyclovir IV (finished a 7 day course), 
ended [**4-5**]).  CSF demonstrated resolving meningitis.  PNA was 
improving.  On [**4-4**] the pt went to OR for repair of CSF leak and 
I&D of cervical wound.  Vancomycin was continued, rifampin added 
at 300mg po /ng q8h on [**4-5**], and acyclovir was d/c'd (completed 
course).  [**Last Name (un) 720**] was consulted during this time to assist w/ DM 
mgmt.  Pt failed S&S study, and had PEG placement [**4-11**].  He was 
transferred to surgical floor on [**4-8**], w/ vanco and rifampin 
continued.   PICC line placed [**4-10**].  ID agreed to treat for six 
weeks from most recent attempt at repair of CSF leak (ie through 
[**5-17**]) with vanco/rifampin and ID signed off [**4-10**].  [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4214**] is 
the ID fellow following the pt.  The pt started tube feeds with 
[**Last Name (un) 720**] following for strict glucose control. Neurology signed 
off [**4-14**], along with general surgery (PEG). his mental status 
was noted to be much improved with decreased sedation.  
.
Then, on [**4-15**], he started spiked temp 103.6, with all cx (blood, 
Ua, urine negative, cxr--resolving PNA).  Incision healing well 
without pus/drainage.  C. diff checked and negative.  The pt 
continued to spike low grade temps.  Pt pulled out PICC and it 
repeat PICC was deffered in setting of low grade temps.  Patient 
was also noted to have suicidal ideation [**4-17**] PM, psych 
consulted, and and briefly had 1:1 sitter.  Pt also in the 
evening of 3/23, noted to be tachypneic, anxious, tachycardic to 
130s.  He was noted to have a pulm embolism and was started on 
heparin gtt and transferred to medicine floor team for further 
management.
.
AM of 3/31 patient had tachypnea, fevers, tachycardia and 
altered mental status and was transferred to the MICU.  The 
hospital course there after is divided by systems as below.
.
**** Respiratory ****
# Respiratory Failure: Upon transfer to MICU, pt found 
tachypneic to 40's w/ ?altered mental status on shovel mask. 
Initial ABG 7.43/39/85 and pt CXR not revealing for new 
infiltrate.  Brief trial of BiPAP halted when follow-up gas 
revealed profound acidosis with large component of hyercarbia. 
Intubated for management of hyercarbia thought related to meds 
(narcotics prior to BiPAP and ?resp fatigue). Although initially 
improved with intubation, pt became increasingly difficult to 
ventilate and developed profound metaboic lactic acidosis.  
Etiology of lactate acidosis not entirely clear but felt 
seconary to underlying sepsis. Although initially did not 
tolerate  AC/PSV, pt has shown mild improvements in ventilation 
w/ increased sedation. On heavy sedation and AC ventilation, PH 
remained in 7.15-7.2 range. Given high minute ventilation, 
attempts to correct metabolic acidosis included sodium 
bicarbonate. In addition to metabolic acidosis, pt had possible 
evidence of LLL PNA and was growing Staph in sputum. He was 
treated with Vanco/Zosyn/Flagyl for an 8 day course. He also has 
history of RUL PE and u/s on [**4-27**] did demonstrate evidence of a 
thrombus on right superficial vein. He had a transient episode 
of hypoxia/tachycarida/hypotension on [**5-1**] which may have been 
caused by recurrent PEs. He had been off of heparin gtt for a 
procedure. It was thought that this did not constitute a failure 
of anticoagulation and IVC filter was not pursued at the time. 
He was started on CVVH and then HD when his BP stabilized for 
fluid removal. He was extubated on [**5-4**] and is satting well on 
2LNC and transferred to the floor.  He was noted to have fevers 
and increased LLL consolidation and meropenam was added [**5-17**] 
Patient completed 14 days of meropenem. Lates Ct Scan chest 
showed sligly decrease of left lower lobe consolidation.
Patient has been satting 94-95% on Shavel mask since arrival to 
the floor.
.
#  PE - Maintained on heparin gtt. Can be transition to warfarin 
over the next few days.
#  Oropharynx bleeding - Patient had poor mouth care in setting 
of oral care he was noted to have bleeding from the oropharynx 
during .  ENT was called to evaluate the patient and just prior 
to ENT eval patient had an episode of desaturation.  He was 
transferred to MICU.  ENT pulled out a bloody crust from the 
oropharynx and recommended saline nasal sprays, vaseline to 
nares and humidified O2.
.
**** Cardiovascular ****
# Hypotension/Hypertension: Although initially normotensive in 
the micu following intubation patient developed hypotension 
requiring max doses of Levophed as well as vasopressin. The 
etiolgy of hypotension not entirely clear but thought most 
likely secondary to sepsis vs drug hypersensitivity.  He had an 
echo which showed EF of 30%.  He was weaned off pressors and 
after transfer to the floor was hypertensive and started on 
Metoprolol, Amlodipine. HCTZ added on [**5-20**]. Started hydral [**5-23**] 
and d/c [**2825-5-29**]. Ace started on [**2825-5-25**] and titrated up as 
tolerated.

.
# Atrial fibrillation: Noted to have transient episode of afib 
on [**4-25**] and [**4-26**]. Rate controlled on lopressor. Anticoagulated 
with heparin gtt which may be transitioned to coumadin.
.
# NSTEMI: Has h/o CAD, s/p 3V CABG in [**2789**]. Last PMIBI [**3-3**] 
showing normal 
Initially Trop 0.12 with CK-MB 6. TTE did not show evidence of 
focal WMA. New global HK thought to be secondary to cardiac 
depression from sepsis. Suspect component of demand ischemia w/ 
decreased clearance of enzymes in setting of renal 
insufficiency.  Maintained on ASA, BB (once off pressors).  LDL 
was low and statin was deffered.  ACE inhibitor started on 
[**2825-5-25**] once renal function had improved.
.
# CHF: EF 30% though to be secondary to sepsis. Titrating BB. 
Ace inhibitors started on [**2825-5-25**].
.
# Arrythmias: Pt had an episode of a bradycardic junctional 
rhythm [**4-28**] as he was having TTE performed. This was transient 
and thought to be secondary to increased vagal tone from the 
ultrasound probe. 

**** ID **** 
# Fever:  Patient was febrile in the ICU and had a leukocytosis 
to 25K w/ profound bandemia and eosinophilia and has mixed 
venous sats in 80's. BC/UC/Stool cultures have been unrevealing. 
 Aggressive search for a source of infection was unrevealing 
which included RUQ US, repeat LP, MRI/CT of C-spine, MRI head, 
and multiple blood, urine and stool cultures. Sputum cultures 
have grown MRSA, but given no definite infiltrate and scant 
sputum, it was thought more likely to be a colonizer. His abx 
regimen was broadened to Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl per ID recs.  
Rifampin was discontined given concerns about generalized 
erythrodermic rash, peripheral eosinohilia and urine 
eosinophilia concerning for a drug hypersensitivity reaction. 
There was a concern that he may have a drug hypersenstivity to 
Zosyn or vancomycin. Zosyn was d/c'd on [**5-3**] and Vanco was 
switched to linezolid on [**5-6**].  After transfer to the floor he 
was continued on linezolid and remained afebrile for several 
days and then spiked again on [**5-14**].  After culturing over the 
next two days and repeat LP without meningitis meropenam was 
added on [**5-17**] for nosocomial PNA. Fevers resolved.Patient 
compleated 59 days of linezolid and was switch to doxicicline on 
[**2825-6-3**]. Also on [**5-23**] patient again spiking fevers. Blood cx on 
[**2825-5-26**] showed [**Female First Name (un) 929**], patient was started on Caspo and then 
switch to voriconazol given elevated Alk phoph and LDH.
Ofthalmology was consulted and there was no evidence of eye 
involvement. CT abdomen no liver or spleen abnormalities. TTE no 
evidence of endocarditis.
Patient to complete 14 days of caspo- to finnished on [**2825-6-11**]. 
He should continue on doxacicline indefinite for suppresion 
therapy.
.
**** Neuro ****
# Altered mental status: Pt noted with waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 105**] ms on floor 
that was presumed secondary to increased fevers, metabolic 
stress. Repeat LP did not show evidence of continued meningitis. 
He was weaned off all sedatives and remained minimally 
responsive for several days. Head CT did not show evidence of 
acute hemorrhage. MRI head showed evidence of a small subacute 
left occipital infarct. Neurology was consulted and did not 
think that it was the cause of his mental status changes. His 
mental status waxed and waned thought secondary to infection.

multifactorial. MRI was attempted 4 times and it was unable to 
be performed due to cooperation.
Last Ct did not reveal any gross abnormality but was limited [**2-27**]

CSF sample was clean. He will continue on MRSA therapy 
indefinite.

# Weakness: Pt having weakness that is more proximal than 
distal, R>L. Neurology and orthospine following patient.  DDx 
included ICU myopathy or steroid myopathy.  Patient underwent 
repeat MRI head and C spine.  Images were reviewed by 
ortho/spine attending.  His impression was that the C7 lesion 
near the hardware was not worse then before and this would not 
explain his neuro exam.  Neurology was reconsulted regarding the 
weakness. unclear etiology. Continue to be persistent. Unable to 
get new MRI [**2-27**] cooperation. When patient is off sedation and 
clinical ""stable"" his deficts are slightly improved  which is 
hopeful that aggressive PT/OT and resolution of his myriad of 
medical problems will confirm a better neurologic prognosis.
.
# L occiptial infarct:  On repeat MRI of head, L occiptial 
lesion had persistent T2 hyperintensity and there was concern 
for abscess.  Neurosurgery was consulted and they recommended 
continuing antibiotics and a repeat MRI in 4 weeks. We have been 
unable to get a new MRI due to lack of cooperation by time of 
discharged.

Linezolid (start [**5-6**] to be continued until ID appt [**6-10**], 
switched to PO [**5-17**]) Day 58-  switched  to suprresion therapy on 
[**2825-6-3**] with doxicicline.

**** Renal ****
# Renal Failure: Creatinine baseline 1.6 (presumably secondary 
to DM/HTN).  Pt has had progression of renal dysfunction during 
MICU and became anuric. Etiology thought to represent sequalae 
of septic shock and interstitial nephritis given urine eos. 
Urine sparse for exam but did reveal urine eos and FENA less 
than 1%. Urine lytes did initially show pre-renal physiology. 
Renal u/s negative for obstructive physiology. Pt does have 
severe metabolic acidosis but o/w not significant hyperkalemia. 
He had a right subclavian temporary HD line placed [**5-1**] and was 
started on CVVH and then transitioned to HD on [**5-5**]. Also 
started on Calcium Carbonate/Renagel for phos binders.  His 
renal function improved and patient started making urine and was 
HD was discontinued. Creatinine slowly resolved and even went 
below what was thought to be his baseline 1.6. On day of d/c 
creatinine 1.3, good urine output.

 Hyperkalemia: Receieved Kayexalate on [**2825-6-2**] with K+ 
5.5-->5.1-->5.0 No EKG changes. No AG on Chem 7, and renal 
funcion has resolved. K slightly elevated in last morning labs,

currently trendings down. alt and AST normal. U/S done did not 
show [**Last Name (un) 9368**] duct dilatation, but repeat CT does reveal biliary 
sludge. TB is flat.  
Caspo switched to voraconazol [**2-27**] hepatic dysfunction. Will need 
to continue to closely monitor LFT's  
.
**** Derm ****
# Rash: Pt noted to have blanching macular morbilliform rash on 
initial transfer to MICU. Dermatolgy has evaluated and thought 
to represent delayed hypersensitivity drug eruption with unknown 
precipitant given many drug regimen changes around this time. 
His rash on BUE progressed to blistering lesions which were 
thought to be due to edema from fuid overload. He was started on 
Bactroban ointment for these lesions. 
After medication changes rash improved slowly.  
.
**** Endocrine ****
# Diabetes: In the ICU required insulin gtt and was taken off 
insulin gtt on [**5-6**]. Requirements were thought to be from high 
dose steroids. [**Last Name (un) 720**] followed patient and glargine dose 
adjusted based on fasting sugars.

necessary.

# CODE: Full  
FAMILY MEETING: Discussed with wife (HCP) and 2 daughters after 
long family meeting along with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1024**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in Neurology. 
Explained to family that exact etiology of his waxing & [**Doctor Last Name 105**] 
mental status, R US and bilateral LE weakness has not been fully 
elicited. Our work up has been limited [**2-27**] to cooperation; too 
agitated to perform MRI, and unable to follow commands for 
clinical exam. Family feels that when patient is off all 
sedation/narcotics, afebrile and hemodynamically stable, Mr. 
[**Known patient lastname 9372**] is able to communicate with them at a near-baseline 
functional level. Although PT/OT and RN has not seen dramatic 
mechanical improvement with his physical rehab, family is 
hopeful that if medical conditions (PE,MRSA,Candidemia,RP bleed, 
HTN, Cerebritis, Diabetes, Hepatitis, resolving renal failure) 
remain stable, that he will start to make neurologic recovery. 
We still do not know the full etiology of his neurogic 
compromise (SC infectious involvement, stroke, or ICU myopathy) 
his mental status is hard to determine to what functional level 
he will return to given the multitude of metabolic 
encephalopathic insults (MRSA/[**Female First Name (un) **] infections, Cerebritis, 
Sepsis, Renal failure, ? of hepatic encephalopathy [**2-27**] his Hep 
C). Medically, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 9372**] is stable will finish out the 
remaining 14 days of antifungal therapy and will continue on 
MRSA suppressive therapy. He will also continue on Heparin for 
his PE as his HCT is stable and his repeat CT of his RP bleed is 
stable. We now have a window for him to pursue aggressive PT/OT 
rehab in hopes that we will see the potential of his neurologic 
recovery. The family wishes to continue aggressive care and that 
he remains a full code. We did discuss that if he were to become 
reinfected, or succumb to yet another complication, it would 
make his chance of any recovery very guarded and that future 
goals of care would be broached at that time.

     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with C5-6 discectomy and fusion on [**2825-3-5**], now
     with severe posterior neck pain, nausea and fever for further evaluation.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and gradient echo, T2 and
     T1 axial images of the cervical spine were obtained before gadolinium.  T1
     sagittal and axial images were obtained following gadolinium.
     
     FINDINGS:  At C5-6 and C6-7 level patient has undergone previous surgery.  At
     C6 level the patient has a pedicle screw within the left pleural mass.  From
     C2-3 to C7-T1 and inferiorly degenerative disc disease are identified.  No
     spinal stenosis, intraspinal fluid collection or spinal cord compression is
     seen.
     
     From C2-T1 level there is fluid within the posterior soft tissues with
     irregular configuration and some enhancement in the surrounding.  This could
     be secondary to postoperative fluid collection but infection cannot be
     excluded.
     
     There is subtle epidural enhancement seen on the left side C5-6 and C6-7
     levels which could be secondary to surgery.  No evidence of epidural abscess
     is identified.  No intraspinal fluid collection or spinal cord compression is
     seen.  There is no evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis.  There is no
     evidence of abnormal signal seen within the spinal cord.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Posterior fluid collection from C2-T1 level which could be
     secondary to surgery but infection cannot be excluded.  No evidence of
     epidural abscess or intraspinal fluid collection or spinal cord compression.
     Mild multilevel degenerative changes.  Postoperative changes at C6-7 levels
     with cerclage wires and left pedicle screw.  Findings were discussed with Dr.

     fracture through the right C7 pars interarticularis is again identified. The
     prevertebral soft tissue structures appear unremarkable.  The previously
     identified epidural abscess is not well appreciated on this study given
     artifact from the hardware.  No other fractures are identified.  In the left
     lung apex is a 7 x 14 mm consolidative opacity of uncertain significance.
     Again seen is edema in the posterior subcutaneous tissues.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Vertebral body heights preserved without evidence of cortical destruction.
     2.  Posterior hardware at the C6 and C7 levels.
     3.  Fracture of the right C7 pars interarticularis.
     4.  Small left lung apical opacity of uncertain significance.
     5. Fluid collection in posterior soft-tissues is better evaluated on MR of the
     same day.

     MRI CERVICAL SPINE
     
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with C5-6 discectomy and fusion on [**2825-3-5**], now
     with severe posterior neck pain, nausea and fever for further evaluation.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and gradient echo, T2 and
     T1 axial images of the cervical spine were obtained before gadolinium.  T1
     sagittal and axial images were obtained following gadolinium.
     
     FINDINGS:  At C5-6 and C6-7 level patient has undergone previous surgery.  At
     C6 level the patient has a pedicle screw within the left pleural mass.  From
     C2-3 to C7-T1 and inferiorly degenerative disc disease are identified.  No
     spinal stenosis, intraspinal fluid collection or spinal cord compression is
     seen.
     
     From C2-T1 level there is fluid within the posterior soft tissues with
     irregular configuration and some enhancement in the surrounding.  This could
     be secondary to postoperative fluid collection but infection cannot be
     excluded.
     
     There is subtle epidural enhancement seen on the left side C5-6 and C6-7
     levels which could be secondary to surgery.  No evidence of epidural abscess
     is identified.  No intraspinal fluid collection or spinal cord compression is
     seen.  There is no evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis.  There is no
     evidence of abnormal signal seen within the spinal cord.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Posterior fluid collection from C2-T1 level which could be
     secondary to surgery but infection cannot be excluded.  No evidence of
     epidural abscess or intraspinal fluid collection or spinal cord compression.
     Mild multilevel degenerative changes.  Postoperative changes at C6-7 levels
     with cerclage wires and left pedicle screw.  Findings were discussed with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 1449**] at the time of interpretation of this study.

     INDICATION:  70-year-old man status post I&D for cervical abscess.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2825-3-22**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT images of the cervical spine without IV contrast with
     sagittal and coronal reformatting.
     
     FINDINGS:  There has been interval laminectomies at the C6 and 7 levels with
     partial laminectomy at C5 level.  Soft tissue density is visualized in the
     area with soft tissue stranding and areas of high attenuation representing
     postoperative changes with recent hemorrhage. likely post-operative. Some air
     is also visualized adjacent to these areas of soft tissue densities and
     stranding. There is no evidence of listhesis.  Again noted is a fracture
     through the right C7 pars interarticularis.  The visualized spinal cord is
     unremarkable. Again noted is a consolidative opacity of uncertain significance
     in the left lung apex.
     
     Mild amount of fluid is visualized in the maxillary sinuses along with
     opacification of the posterior nasal cavity.  Patient is status post
     intubation.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Status post laminectomy at C6/7 level and partial laminectomy at
     C5 level.  Postoperative changes in this area with patchy areas of increased
     attenuation representing recent hemorrhage, likely a post operative change.
     
     NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: I agree with the above, except that there is
     essentially no information about the spinal cord on this non contrast spine
     CT.

     HISTORY:  Fever and nausea following C-spine surgery two weeks ago.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**3-21**] and 27 and [**3-26**]:
     
     Consolidation in both lower lungs, greater on the left, unchanged since [**3-26**], progressed since [**4-18**] consistent with pneumonia.  Lateral aspect of
     the left lower chest is excluded from the examination.  The other pleural
     surfaces are normal, although the configuration of the right lung base
     suggests a small right pleural effusion, new since the previous two studies. 
     ET tube is in standard placement and a nasogastric tube ends in the upper
     stomach.

Coarse breath sounds, copious thick yellowish secretions produced and suctioned for, PEEP and PSV decreased to respectively 5 and 8, on which setting patient still seems comfortable. Secretion issues make extubation questionable although RSBI was good, patient will stay on the vent since he is very difficult to intubate because of immobility of his neck, at least until we can get a clear CXR from him.

     GADOLINIUM ENHANCED MR SCAN
     
     HISTORY:  Altered mental status.  Known MRSA infection.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted gadolinium enhanced brain imaging.
     
     COMPARISON STUDY:  CT scan of the brain without intravenous contrast
     enhancement, obtained on [**2825-3-23**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no sign for the presence of an intracranial mass,
     hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.  However, there is a 5
     mm area of restricted diffusion which appears to be within the region of the
     tip of the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 67**], with a possible tiny quantity of similar
     signal hyperintensity in the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 67**].  Given the history of known
     meningeal infection, it is possible that this abnormality could represent a
     tiny amount of either purulent material or subarachnoid hemorrhage.  There are
     no other areas of abnormal diffusion seen within the brain.  There is no
     pathological enhancement seen intracranially.  Since the prior CT scan, there
     is now moderately extensive mucosal thickening within the sphenoid and ethmoid
     sinuses, to a milder degree within the right maxillary sinus and with a
     probable mucous retention cyst 1.5 cm in size, seen within the left maxillary
     sinus. There is mild right frontal air cell mucosal thickening.  There is
     essentially complete loss of aeration of the mastoid sinuses, due to either
     fluid and/or mucosal thickening. The sinus findings could represent the
     effects of recent intubation, as well as superimposed infectious process.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Unusual tiny areas of high signal on diffusion-weighted imaging
     within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles, more evident on the left
     side. The findings could represent the effects of known meningeal infection
     and/or subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Other findings as noted above.

     GADOLINIUM ENHANCED IMAGING OF THE CERVICAL SPINE.
     
     HISTORY:  Status post cervical spine surgery with mental status changes.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted gadolinium-enhanced cervical spine
     imaging.
     
     COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2825-3-22**] cervical spine MR imaging.
     
     Comparison with the prior study reveals persistent extensive posterior fluid
     within both the interspinous and paraspinous soft tissues.  There is
     persistent, moderately longitudinally extensive epidural enhancement spanning
     the area of the laminectomy, with a mild degree of associated compression of
     the spinal cord along its dorsal surface.  While the finding could represent
     postoperative changes, a superimposed epidural infection cannot be excluded.
     Similarly, it is not possible to tell whether the extensive paraspinous and
     interspinous fluid is either sterile or infected, either.  There may be a
     slight quantity of prevertebral soft tissue swelling at this time.  There is
     no sign of abnormal T2 signal either within the vertebral bodies or
     intervertebral disc spaces to suggest osteomyelitis or discitis, respectively.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Complex postoperative study, with findings as noted above.  Both
     the brain and cervical spine MR findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1603**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1604**] this morning ([**2825-3-31**] at 9:30 a.m.).

     essentially complete loss of aeration of the mastoid sinuses, due to either
     fluid and/or mucosal thickening. The sinus findings could represent the
     effects of recent intubation, as well as superimposed infectious process.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Unusual tiny areas of high signal on diffusion-weighted imaging
     within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles, more evident on the left
     side. The findings could represent the effects of known meningeal infection
     and/or subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Other findings as noted above.

     CT PULMONARY ANGIOGRAM
     
     CLINICAL DETAILS:  Tachycardia and fever.
     
     CT ANGIOGRAM FINDINGS:
     
     The main, right and left main pulmonary arteries are patent and normal in
     caliber.  There is a small focus of filling defect in the right upper lobe
     pulmonary artery measuring less than 1 cm in size (series 3 image 72 and
     coronal series image 20) and small (less than 1 cm long) segment of filling
     defect in the proximal portion of the apical segment of the right upper lobe
     (series 3 image 86), and also some non-occlusive filling defect in a
     subsegmental branch of the right upper lobe (series 3 image 39 and 37 ).
     
     Right middle, right lower lobe pulmonary arteries appear patent. Left
     pulmonary artery segmental branches also appear patent.  Minor area of
     subsegmental atelectasis in the posterior aspect of the left lower lobe. Small
     area of pleural-based subsegmental atelectasis at the right lung base
     laterally (series 3 image 158).  No pleural effusions.  No gross pulmonary
     edema.  Some centrilobular emphysematous change bilaterally at the upper-to-
     mid zone level.  Minor motion artifact towards the lung bases limits
     assessment at that level.  Patient has had a previous sternotomy and CABG.
     Central airways are patent.  Normal heart size.  No mediastinal or hilar
     lymphadenopathy.
     
     Thoracic osseous structures show no concerning bone lesions.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     1. Non-occlusive filling defect in the distal end of the right upper lobe
     pulmonary artery and small area in one of its subsegmental branches,
     consistent with pulmonary embolus.
     
     These findings were discussed with resident in the morning of [**2825-4-18**].
     
     CT SCAN OF ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH ORAL AND INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:

     but unchanged compared to previous CT of [**2825-2-13**].
     
     Gallbladder, spleen, both adrenal glands are normal.  Pancreas is normal in
     size, a 9 mm transverse x 7 mm AP ovoid hypodensity in the posterior aspect of
     the proximal pancreatic body (series 4 image 23) is indeterminate on CT but
     may represent a small cystic area.  No abnormal dilatation of the main
     pancreatic duct intra- or extra-hepatic biliary tree.
     
     Both kidneys are normal in size.  Several sub-cm renal cortical hypodensities
     are too small to characterize but unchanged compared to prior CT of [**2825-2-13**].
     
     Abdominal aorta is moderately atherosclerotic but normal in caliber.  No upper
     abdominal lymphadenopathy or free intra-abdominal fluid demonstrated.
     
     PEG tube tip lies within the anterior aspect of the gastric body.
     
     CT SCAN OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL AND INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:
     
     Urinary catheter in situ.  The inflated balloon of this lies at the level of
     the prostate gland rather than within the bladder and needs to be advanced
     (discussed with the orthopedic resident).
     
     Penile implant noted.  
     
     No free pelvic fluid collection.
     
     No concerning bone lesion is demonstrated on bone window settings.  Focal area
     of bony defect along the posterior aspect of the right ilium and a smaller
     area along the posterior aspect of the left ilium most probably represent
     signs of prior bone graft harvest.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     1.  No intra-abdominal or pelvic cause for sepsis demonstrated.
     
     2.  At present the inflated balloon of the urinary catheter lies at the level
     of the prostate gland rather than within the bladder and needs to be deflated
     and advanced.
     
     3.  An 8 to 9 mm hypodensity in the posterior aspect of the proximal
     pancreatic body is indeterminate but may represent a small cystic area.  This
     could be followed up with interval imaging. A 1-cm hypodensity in segment VII
     of the liver unchanged.  Several subcentimeter renal cortical hypodensities
     are too small to characterize but likely small cysts.
                                                                 (Over)

     CT PULMONARY ANGIOGRAM
     
     CLINICAL DETAILS:  Tachycardia and fever.
     
     CT ANGIOGRAM FINDINGS:
     
     The main, right and left main pulmonary arteries are patent and normal in
     caliber.  There is a small focus of filling defect in the right upper lobe
     pulmonary artery measuring less than 1 cm in size (series 3 image 72 and
     coronal series image 20) and small (less than 1 cm long) segment of filling
     defect in the proximal portion of the apical segment of the right upper lobe
     (series 3 image 86), and also some non-occlusive filling defect in a
     subsegmental branch of the right upper lobe (series 3 image 39 and 37 ).
     
     Right middle, right lower lobe pulmonary arteries appear patent. Left
     pulmonary artery segmental branches also appear patent.  Minor area of
     subsegmental atelectasis in the posterior aspect of the left lower lobe. Small
     area of pleural-based subsegmental atelectasis at the right lung base
     laterally (series 3 image 158).  No pleural effusions.  No gross pulmonary
     edema.  Some centrilobular emphysematous change bilaterally at the upper-to-
     mid zone level.  Minor motion artifact towards the lung bases limits
     assessment at that level.  Patient has had a previous sternotomy and CABG.
     Central airways are patent.  Normal heart size.  No mediastinal or hilar
     lymphadenopathy.
     
     Thoracic osseous structures show no concerning bone lesions.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     1. Non-occlusive filling defect in the distal end of the right upper lobe
     pulmonary artery and small area in one of its subsegmental branches,
     consistent with pulmonary embolus.
     
     These findings were discussed with resident in the morning of [**2825-4-18**].
     
     CT SCAN OF ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH ORAL AND INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:
     
     The liver is normal in size, no concerning lesion is demonstrated.  1-cm ovoid
     hypodensity in superior segment VII (series 4 image 15) is indeterminate on CT

     Gallbladder, spleen, both adrenal glands are normal.  Pancreas is normal in
     size, a 9 mm transverse x 7 mm AP ovoid hypodensity in the posterior aspect of
     the proximal pancreatic body (series 4 image 23) is indeterminate on CT but
     may represent a small cystic area.  No abnormal dilatation of the main
     pancreatic duct intra- or extra-hepatic biliary tree.
     
     Both kidneys are normal in size.  Several sub-cm renal cortical hypodensities
     are too small to characterize but unchanged compared to prior CT of [**2825-2-13**].
     
     Abdominal aorta is moderately atherosclerotic but normal in caliber.  No upper
     abdominal lymphadenopathy or free intra-abdominal fluid demonstrated.
     
     PEG tube tip lies within the anterior aspect of the gastric body.
     
     CT SCAN OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL AND INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:
     
     Urinary catheter in situ.  The inflated balloon of this lies at the level of
     the prostate gland rather than within the bladder and needs to be advanced
     (discussed with the orthopedic resident).
     
     Penile implant noted.  
     
     No free pelvic fluid collection.
     
     No concerning bone lesion is demonstrated on bone window settings.  Focal area
     of bony defect along the posterior aspect of the right ilium and a smaller
     area along the posterior aspect of the left ilium most probably represent
     signs of prior bone graft harvest.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     1.  No intra-abdominal or pelvic cause for sepsis demonstrated.
     
     2.  At present the inflated balloon of the urinary catheter lies at the level
     of the prostate gland rather than within the bladder and needs to be deflated
     and advanced.
     
     3.  An 8 to 9 mm hypodensity in the posterior aspect of the proximal
     pancreatic body is indeterminate but may represent a small cystic area.  This
     could be followed up with interval imaging. A 1-cm hypodensity in segment VII
     of the liver unchanged.  Several subcentimeter renal cortical hypodensities
     are too small to characterize but likely small cysts.

     CLINICAL HISTORY:
     
     70-year-old male with L3-4 fusion and status post trauma, now presents with
     fever and signs of sepsis.  To rule out epidural abscess.
     
     MR of the lumbar spine without and with administration of contrast was
     performed.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     The vertebrae are normal in height and alignment.  Heterogeneous marrow noted,
     a nonspecific finding.
     
     The distal spinal cord is unremarkable.
     
     At the level of L3-4, diffuse disc bulge noted with mild central canal
     stenosis and no significant neural canal stenosis.
     
     At the level of L4-5:  Endplate degenerative changes noted with possible
     central disc herniation thereby causing moderate central canal stenosis.  No
     significant neural canal stenosis noted.
     
     At the level of L5-S1:  There is a small central disc protrusion noted
     indenting the ventral aspect of thecal sac and causing moderate central canal
     stenosis.  No significant neural canal stenosis noted.
     
     There is abnormal signal noted in the L5-S1 and possibly in L4-5 disc, raising
     a suspicion of discitis.  Please correlate clinically.
     
     No definite drainable abscess noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Disc herniation noted at the level of L4-5 and L5-S1 as described above.
     
     2.  Findings suspicious for discitis at L5-S1 and possibly at L4-5.
     
     3.  No definite drainable epidural abscess noted.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY:
     
     70-year-old male with L3-4 fusion and status post trauma, now presents with
     fever and signs of sepsis.  To rule out epidural abscess.
     
     MR of the lumbar spine without and with administration of contrast was
     performed.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     The vertebrae are normal in height and alignment.  Heterogeneous marrow noted,
     a nonspecific finding.
     
     The distal spinal cord is unremarkable.
     
     At the level of L3-4, diffuse disc bulge noted with mild central canal
     stenosis and no significant neural canal stenosis.
     
     At the level of L4-5:  Endplate degenerative changes noted with possible
     central disc herniation thereby causing moderate central canal stenosis.  No
     significant neural canal stenosis noted.
     
     At the level of L5-S1:  There is a small central disc protrusion noted
     indenting the ventral aspect of thecal sac and causing moderate central canal
     stenosis.  No significant neural canal stenosis noted.
     
     There is abnormal signal noted in the L5-S1 and possibly in L4-5 disc, raising
     a suspicion of discitis.  Please correlate clinically.
     
     No definite drainable abscess noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Disc herniation noted at the level of L4-5 and L5-S1 as described above.
     
     2.  Findings suspicious for discitis at L5-S1 and possibly at L4-5.
     
     3.  No definite drainable epidural abscess noted.

     INDICATION:  Tachypnea.  Worsening edema.
     
     Endotracheal tube and left subclavian catheter remain in satisfactory
     position.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  There
     has been no significant change in the appearance of left retrocardiac opacity
     and adjacent small left effusion.  However, there is increasing patchy opacity
     at the right lung base, partially obscuring the right hemidiaphragm medially. 
     This could be due to an area of developing atelectasis, aspiration or evolving
     pneumonia.  Followup films are suggested.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  70-year-old man status post trauma with C6/C7 fusion, now with
     fever and increasing white blood cell count.  Query abscess.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial noncontrast images of the cervical spine were obtained.
     Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were performed.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the prior MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] of [**2825-3-30**] and prior CT
     C- spine of [**2824-3-23**].  On sagittal images, the skull base to T2 vertebrae are
     clearly visualized.  The prevertebral soft tissues are within normal limits.
     At the C4/C5 levels there is a low attenuation area, perhaps fluid collection,
     posterior to the lamina, which represents postoperative change and was seen
     on prior exams. There is normal alignment of the component vertebrae.
     There have been laminectomies at the C6 and C7 levels with a partial
     laminectomy at C5. Evaluation of the thecal sac is limited by artifact, but
     there are no findings to suggest cord compression, to the extent that this can
     be evaluated. To assess for epidural abscess, an MRI with contrast is
     recommended.
     Again noted is a consolidative opacity of uncertain significance of the left
     lung apex.
     
     Maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinus, sphenoid sinus, and nasal cavity mucosal
     thickening is noted. There are air-fluid levels in the sphenoid sinus.  The
     patient is status post intubation.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Low attenuation posterior to the lamina at the C4/C5 levels.  This may be
     a postsurgical finding.
     
     2.  No definitive evidence of cord compression.  MRI is more sensitive in the
     evaluation of epidural abscess.
     
     
     
     
                                                                 (Over)

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      r/o cholecystitis, or biliary disease                                           
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL DETAILS:  Elevated white cell count and alkaline phosphatase.
     Evaluate for cholecystitis or biliary disease.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     The liver is normal in size and echogenicity, no focal abnormality. No intra-
     or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.  The common bile duct measures less than
     7 mm in maximal diameter and tapers towards its distal end.
     
     Gallbladder is moderately distended and contains some dependent sludge, no
     gallstones demonstrated.  The wall is at the upper limits of normal to mildly
     thickened at 3-4 mm.  Minimal amount of ascites in the right upper quadrant
     and minimal amount of pericholecystic fluid.  No collections demonstrated in
     the right upper quadrant.  Given  the patient's current medical condition it
     is not possible to assess for the presence or not of a positive [**Doctor Last Name **] sign.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     1.  No intrahepatic biliary dilatation.  7-mm CBD with no intraductal filling
     defect demonstrated.
     
     2.  Moderately distended gallbladder containing sludge.  This appearance can
     commonly be seen in the ICU setting.  The ossibility of acute cholecystitis
     cannot be excluded with this appearance.  If there is strong clinical concern
     for this, then further correlation with HIDA scan should be considered.

     CHEST X-RAY.
     
     HISTORY:  Hypoxic respiratory failure, now two weeks after C-spine surgery. 
     Rule out CHF or infiltrate.
     
     FINDINGS:  Two portable semi-upright chest radiographs show no change in
     positioning of endotracheal tube or left subclavian central venous catheter
     compared to the prior exams.  Left lower lobe consolidation appears slightly
     worse with continued obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and now with more
     evident air bronchograms.  Apparent consolidation in the right upper lobe
     appears to be related to obliquity of both these portable views.  Lower
     cervical spine fractures and left-sided hardware noted.
     
     CONCLUSION:  No improvement, and perhaps slight worsening in left lower lobe
     consolidation.

     INDICATION:  A 70-year-old man with renal failure, requires temporary
     hemodialysis line placement for continuous hemodialysis.
     
     RADIOLOGIST:  Doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 1635**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 603**].  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 602**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 603**], the attending
     physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1636**] present throughout the procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  Written informed consent was obtained. Following a
     preprocedure timeout, including the patient's name, and two patient
     identifiers, the patient was placed supine on the angiographic table. The
     right neck was draped and prepped in the usual sterile fashion.
     
     After administration of approximately 5 cc of subcutaneous 1% lidocaine,
     ultrasound was used to access the right subclavian vein with a 21-gauge
     needle.  Hardcopy ultrasound images were obtained before and after venous
     accessing, to document vessel patency.  A 0.018 guidewire was then advanced
     into the right subclavian vein and superior vena cava under fluoroscopic
     guidance.  The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture sheath and the 0.018
     wire exchanged for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 555**].  The [**Doctor Last Name 555**] was advanced under fluoroscopic
     guidance into the inferior vena cava.  The micropuncture sheath was then
     exchanged for serial fascial dilators to a maximum of 14.5-French, under
     fluoroscopic guidance.
     
     A 20 cm temporary dialysis catheter was then advanced over the wire under
     fluoroscopic guidance into the right atrium.  The wire was removed and a final
     fluoroscopic image was obtained to confirm the tip of this catheter in the
     right atrium.  The line was flushed and heplocked, then sutured in place and
     dressed with a sterile dressing.  There were no procedural, or immediate post-
     procedure complications.  The line is ready for use.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 20 cm 14.5-French temporary
     hemodialysis catheter via the right subclavian vein into the right atrium. The
     line is ready for use.

     INDICATION:  A 70-year-old man with renal failure, requires temporary
     hemodialysis line placement for continuous hemodialysis.
     
     RADIOLOGIST:  Doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 1635**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 603**].  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 602**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 603**], the attending
     physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1636**] present throughout the procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  Written informed consent was obtained. Following a
     preprocedure timeout, including the patient's name, and two patient
     identifiers, the patient was placed supine on the angiographic table. The
     right neck was draped and prepped in the usual sterile fashion.
     
     After administration of approximately 5 cc of subcutaneous 1% lidocaine,
     ultrasound was used to access the right subclavian vein with a 21-gauge
     needle.  Hardcopy ultrasound images were obtained before and after venous
     accessing, to document vessel patency.  A 0.018 guidewire was then advanced
     into the right subclavian vein and superior vena cava under fluoroscopic
     guidance.  The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture sheath and the 0.018
     wire exchanged for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 555**].  The [**Doctor Last Name 555**] was advanced under fluoroscopic
     guidance into the inferior vena cava.  The micropuncture sheath was then
     exchanged for serial fascial dilators to a maximum of 14.5-French, under
     fluoroscopic guidance.

     EXAM:  MRI brain.
     
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with C7 vertebral fracture and multiple
     repairs, with fever and hypertension and uremia and mental status changes.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR, T2 susceptibility and diffusion
     axial images of the brain were obtained before gadolinium.  T1 sagittal, axial
     and coronal images of the brain were obtained following gadolinium. Comparison
     was made with the previous MRI of [**2825-3-30**] and CT of [**2825-4-27**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is increased signal identified on FLAIR images along the
     sulci of both cerebral hemispheres.  Again fluid-fluid levels are seen within
     the occipital horns of both lateral ventricles.  These findings are indicative
     of proteinaceous material or blood within the CSF space.  Clinical correlation
     with lumbar puncture is recommended.  The diffusion images demonstrate a focus
     of slow diffusion in the left occipital lobe.  This area demonstrates
     enhancement following gadolinium.  These findings are suggestive of a subacute
     infarct.  There is mild prominence of ventricles.  Diffuse soft tissue changes
     are seen within both mastoid air cells and mucosal thickening is seen in the
     visualized sinuses.  Vascular flow voids are maintained.
     
     Soft tissue swelling is seen bilaterally in parietal skin, could be related to
     generalized edema.  There is no midline shift seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Slow diffusion in the left occipital lobe with subtle
     enhancement, these findings would indicate subacute infarct.  Diffuse
     increased signal in the sulci and fluid-fluid levels in the occipital horns of
     both lateral ventricles are indicative of proteinaceous material within the
     CSF spaces and correlation with lumbar puncture is recommended to exclude
     infection.  Diffuse soft tissue changes are seen in both mastoid air cells.

     MRI OF THE CERVICAL SPINE.
     
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with fevers and hypotension, fluid collection,
     and abscess, for further evaluation.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1-, T2-sagittal and gradient echo, T1- and T2-axial images of the
     cervical spine were obtained before gadolinium.  T1-sagittal and axial images
     were obtained following gadolinium.  Comparison was made with the previous MRI
     examination of [**2825-3-30**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Again, extensive laminectomies are seen in the cervical region from
     C5-T1 level.  Previously seen fluid collection within the posterior soft
     tissues has considerably decreased since the previous study.  Again, some
     deformity of the spinal cord is seen at C6-7 level posteriorly along the
     epidural surface as before.  Mild epidural enhancement is also identified,
     predominantly on the left side at C6-C7 level as before.  The previously
     identified leptomeningeal enhancement has decreased.  There is no evidence of
     discitis or osteomyelitis.  The deformity of the spinal cord seen in the lower
     cervical region has slightly increased since the previous study.  Subtle
     increased signal suspected within the spinal cord on sagittal T2 images could
     not be confirmed on axial images.  No abnormal enhancement is seen in this
     region.  There is no evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Since the previous MRI examination, the fluid at the laminectomy
     site has decreased.  There is slight deformity of the spinal cord seen, which
     could be secondary to focal adhesions, which is more pronounced since the
     previous study.  Subtle increased signal suspected within the spinal cord at
     C7 level could be due to myelomalacia, but could not be confirmed on the axial
     images.  The previously seen leptomeningeal enhancement has decreased.  No
     evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis is seen.  Followup is recommended.

     COMPARISON:  [**2825-5-3**].
     
     AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST:  This study was performed on [**2825-5-5**],
     although this dictation was lost, so now it is being redictated on [**2825-5-7**].  There remain a right subclavian dual-lumen catheter and left subclavian

     brachiocephalics with the SVC.  The patient is status post CABG and the heart
     size and cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Given differences in

     AP CHEST, 8:21 A.M. [**5-14**].
     
     HISTORY:  Cervical spine surgery.  Hypoxic respiratory failure.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**5-5**] and 11:
     
     Left lower lobe is collapsed.  Small left pleural effusion is smaller.  Right
     pleural effusion has resolved since [**5-6**].
     
     Tips of left and right subclavian central venous lines project over the
     junction of the brachiocephalic veins.  Heart size normal.  No pneumothorax.

     INDICATION:  History of MRSA meningitis, CVAs, assess for bleed prior to
     lumbar puncture.
     
     COMPARISON:  Non-contrast head CT from [**2825-4-27**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  Motion limits assessment.  Given this, no intra- or extra-axial
     hemorrhage is identified.  There is no mass effect or shift of normally
     midline structures.  The ventricles are normal in size and symmetric.  The
     basal cisterns are well visualized.  Density of the brain parenchyma appears
     unremarkable.  Again seen is bilateral opacification of the mastoid air cells
     as well as opacification of scattered ethmoid air cells.  There is mucosal
     thickening of the left maxillary sinus with the appearance of a retention cyst
     along the lateral wall.  The findings are all similar to [**4-27**].  The orbits
     appear unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     INDICATION:  Fever and change in mental status.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT of the cervical spine from [**2825-4-28**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scanning of the neck was performed without
     intravenous contrast.
     
     FINDINGS:  No pathologic cervical lymphadenopathy is identified.  Bilateral
     central venous catheters are seen terminating in the superior vena cava.  A
     layering pleural effusion is seen in the left lung. The parapharyngeal fat
     planes appear preserved.  Hardware is seen in the left posterior elements of
     the C6 and C7 vertebral bodies.  The patient is status post laminectomies at
     the C6 and C7 levels as well as a partial laminectomy at C5.  The previously
     identified fluid collection at the surgical site is poorly visualized on this
     non contrast CT examination. Although there have been no gross changes, the
     study is not sensitive enough to evaluate the possibility of progression of
     infection in this location. An MR examination would be far superior for this
     purpose.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Left-sided pleural effusion.  Limited examination due to lack of
     contrast does not demonstrate any worsening cervical abnormalities. However,
     if there is clinical concern, an MR examination is recommended.

     INDICATION:  70-year-old man with fall, C7 fracture and MRSA meningitis, PE
     with left PCA ""defect"" consistent with vasculitis or septic emboli.  Right-
     sided weakness.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain with and without the
     administration of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 116**].  MR angiography with time-of-
     flight technique with multiplanar reformations.
     
     COMPARISON:  Brain MRI exams dated [**2825-5-3**] and [**2825-3-30**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     Again, note is made of somewhat hyperintense CSF bilaterally in the sulcal
     subarachnoid space, which is somewhat less prominent compared to the prior
     study, likely representing abnormal CSF related to known meningitis.  No
     definite leptomeningeal enhancement is noted.  There is focal FLAIR-
     hyperintensity in the left occipital lobe surrounded by edema, with
     corresponding restricted diffusion, persistent since prior study. The
     appearance and the persistence of the abnormal diffusion signal are somewhat
     atypical for infarction, and the finding is worrisome for another process,
     such as cerebritis or early abscess formation.  Again demonstrated is unusual
     very small focus of restricted diffusion, apparently located in the most
     posterior portion of left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 67**] (or subependyma), persistent since
     [**2825-3-30**]. The previously mentioned lesion in left occipital lobe may be
     continuous to this abnormal signal in left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 67**], which is likely due
     to the same process. No other focus of restricted diffusion is identified.
     
     There is hyperintense signal within bilateral ethmoid sinuses, increased
     compared to the prior study, representing sinusitis.  There is hyperintense
     polyp versus mucus retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus. Extensive
     opacification of bilateral mastoid air cells is unchanged, representing
     mastoiditis.
     
     MR ANGIOGRAPHY:  There is normal flow related enhancement in included portions
     of both ICAs and ACAs, and normal symmetric MCA branches are seen, without
     flow limiting stenosis or aneurysm.  Right PCA is tortuous. Likely
     congenitally hypoplastic A1 segment of right ACA is seen.  Normal flow related
     enhancement is seen in bilateral distal vertebral arteries and posterior
                                                                 (Over)

     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Focal FLAIR-hyperintensity with enhancement in left occipital lobe, with
     restricted diffusion, increased in size compared to the prior study.  The
     persistent diffusion abnormalit is atypical for ""bland"" infarction, and is
     worrisome for another process, such as cerebritis/early abscess, or
     vasculitis. Close correlation with other clinical and laboratory information
     is strongly recommended.
     
     2.  Persistent very small focus of restricted diffusion in posterior dependent
     aspect of the trigone of the left lateral ventricle.  This may be either
     intraventricular or subependymal, has persisted since the [**3-31**] study, and may
     be continuous with the process in left occipital lobe parenchyma. This
     finding is highly atypical of infarction, but may represent either
     active inflammatory process or its residuum.
     
     3.  Persistent hyperintense sulcal CSF, without leptomeningeal enhancement,
     related to known meningitis (have recent lumbar punctures documented clearing
     of inflammation?).
     
     4.  Extensive opacification of ethmoid sinuses, representing sinusitis, and
     evidence of mastoiditis; either of these may represent so-called parameningeal
     foci of infection, related to the history of meningitis.
     
     5.  No definite larger vessel abnormality on MR angiography (MRA cannot
     excluded small vessel vasculitis).

     COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to the prior MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] dated [**2825-5-3**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The study is markedly limited due to motion artifact in this
     patient with sedation and labored wheezing.  Reportedly, the best possible
     images at thet time were obtained; however, there are no axial T2W [**Last Name (un) 1651**] or
     post- contrast images.
     
     The patient is status post laminectomy at C6 and C7, with hyperintense signal
     within the deep soft tissues in the posterior neck, as well as septated,
     multilocular fluid collection, smaller compared to the prior study. The
     assessment of the cord signal and leptomeningeal enhancement is somewhat
     limited without appropriate axial images; however, the leptomeningeal
     enhancement appears somewhat less prominent compared to the prior study, and
     no definite abnormal cord signal is seen.  Again noted are
     multilevel degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine.  Note is made
     of mucosal thickening in maxillary sinuses, as noted on brain MRI.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Limited study, status post C6-7laminectomy, with smaller
     multilocular fluid collection, and hyperintensity and enhancement of deep soft
     tissues in the posterior neck, at the operative bed. This finding could
     represent either persistent infectious phlegmon or ""bland"" granulation tissue.
     The leptomeningeal enhancement about the cervical cord appears less
     prominent.
     
     COMMENT: The information was discussed with the referring physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 527**].
     [**Last Name (STitle) 1649**], at the time of interpretation.

     INDICATION:  Hypoxia, fever, worsening left lower lobe opacification on chest
     x-ray.  Concern for nosocomial pneumonia.
     
     COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from [**2825-5-17**]; CT torso from [**2825-4-18**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired contiguous axial images of the chest were obtained
     without intravenous contrast.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Multiple subcentimeter non-
     pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are demonstrated within the precarinal,
     pretracheal, prevascular, and axillary regions.  Patient is status post median
     sternotomy and CABG.  There is marked coronary artery calcification
     demonstrated.  Heart, pericardium, and great vessels otherwise appear
     unremarkable.  There is no pericardial effusion.  Small left pleural effusion
     is present.
     
     Lung window images demonstrate consolidation within the left lower lobe with
     air bronchograms, findings consistent with pneumonia.  A small, ill-defined
     patchy airspace opacity is seen in the medial segment of the right middle
     lobe. Additionally, a round calcification is seen within the left lower lobe,
     consistent with a granuloma. Patchy airspace opacity is also demonstrated
     within the right lower lobe in the dependent portion, likely representing
     atelectasis.  No definite pulmonary nodules are seen.  The airways are patent
     to the level of segmental bronchi bilaterally.
     
     In the visualized portion of the upper abdomen, a percutaneous gastrostomy
     tube is identified.  Punctate calcifications are seen within the pancreas,
     likely sequela of chronic pancreatitis.  Small amount of ascites is seen
     predominantly with fluid around the spleen.  An ill-defined hypodensity within
     the right posterior segment of the liver is again demonstrated, not
     significantly changed since the prior study from [**2825-4-18**].  No other
     significant abnormalities are seen within the visualized portion of the upper
     abdomen.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are present.
     Degenerative changes are noted in the axial spine.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     into the right basilic vein and the 0.018 guidewire was placed into the SVC
     under flouroscopic guidance. Hard copy ultrasound images were obtained before
     and after venous access documenting vessel patency. A 41 cm catheter was then
     advanced into the SVC over the wire. A final ultrasound image obtained to
     confirm intravascular position of the catheter. Final fluoroscopic image
     confirmed position of the tip of the catheter in the SVC.

     HISTORY:  70-year-old man with C7 fracture and meningitis.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1657**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 603**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 603**]. the Attending
     Radiologist, was present for the entire procedure.
     
     FINDINGS/TECHNIQUE:  The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table
     and the right arm was prepped and draped sterilely.  1% lidocaine was
     administered for local anesthesia.  Ultrasound imaging was performed to
     confirm patency of the right basilic vein.  A 21-gauge needle was advanced
     into the right basilic vein and the 0.018 guidewire was placed into the SVC
     under flouroscopic guidance. Hard copy ultrasound images were obtained before
     and after venous access documenting vessel patency. A 41 cm catheter was then
     advanced into the SVC over the wire. A final ultrasound image obtained to
     confirm intravascular position of the catheter. Final fluoroscopic image
     confirmed position of the tip of the catheter in the SVC.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Placement of a double-lumen 41 cm PICC line via the right basilic
     vein with the tip in the SVC.  The catheter is ready for use.

     INDICATION:  Recent MRSA meningitis, PE, nosocomial pneumonia with spiking
     fevers.  Evaluate for worsening pulmonary process.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2825-5-17**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired axial images of the chest were obtained without IV
     contrast.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Compared to the prior study, the
     previously seen left lower lobe consolidation appears smaller.  There is still
     evidence of consolidation with air bronchograms, consistent with pneumonia in
     the left lower lobe . Patchy airspace opacity is also again seen in the
     dependent portion of right lower lung, slightly decreased from prior study,
     again possibly representing a small infectious source or atelectasis.
     
     Again seen are multiple mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes that do not
     appear to meet CT criteria for pathological enlargement, unchanged from prior
     study.  Coronary artery calcification appears unchanged.  There has been mild
     decrease in the previously seen pleural effusions.
     
     Limited views of the upper abdomen are not significantly changed from prior
     study.  Again seen is a gastrostomy tube.  Calcification is again noted within
     the pancreas.  Small amount of fluid again seen surrounding the spleen.
     Hypodensity in the right lobe of the liver appears unchanged.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Interval decrease in size of left lower lobe consolidation.  Air bronchograms
     and consolidations are still seen, consistent with pneumonia. Small
     parenchymal airspace opacity again seen in the right lower lobe, possibly
     representing atelectasis or small focus of infection. Otherwise, no
     significant change from prior study.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     CLINICAL DETAILS:  Elevated alkaline phosphatase, fever. Evaluate gallbladder.
     
     Comparison is made to previous imaging.
     
     FINDINGS:  
     
     The liver is normal in size and echogenicity, no focal lesions.  No intra or
     extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  The CBD measures less than 4 mm in diameter.
     
     Sludge within the dependent portion of the moderately gallbladder(less
     distended than previous scan of [**2825-4-26**]). No gallstones, gallbladder wall
     measures up to 3mm.
     
     Right kidney appears normal, no hydronephrosis.  No free upper abdominal
     fluid.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     1)  Moderately distended sludge-filled gallbladder.  Appearance is similar to
     the recent ultrasound of [**2825-4-28**]. No biliary dilatation. Further
     evaluation with HIDA scan could be considered if cholecystitis remains a
     concern.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  70-year-old male with C7 fracture, meningitis, and MRSA
     pneumonia.  Needs PICC for IV antibiotics and TPN.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1635**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 250**].  The attending radiologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 553**]
     [**Name (STitle) 250**], was present throughout the procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite and
     placed supine on the angiography table.  The left arm was prepped and draped
     in the usual sterile fashion.  Ultrasound confirmed the left brachial vein was
     patent and compressible.  5 cc of 1% lidocaine was applied for local
     anesthesia.  Under ultrasonographic guidance, a 21-gauge needle was used to
     access the left brachial vein.  Ultrasound films were obtained before and
     after the access was achieved.  A 0.018-inch guide wire was placed through the
     needle under fluoroscopic guidance with the tip in the superior vena cava. The
     needle was exchanged for a 4-French peel-away sheath.  The length of the PICC
     was measured to be 47 cm.  The inner dilator was removed, and a double-lumen
     PICC line was placed over the wire under fluoroscopic guidance with the tip
     terminating in the superior vena cava.  The peel-away sheath and the wire were
     removed.  Both lumens of the catheter were flushed, and the line was secured
     to the skin with a StatLock device.  A final fluoroscopic image confirmed
     catheter tip position within the distal SVC.  The patient tolerated the
     procedure well, and there were no procedural or immediate post- procedural
     complications.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  1% lidocaine for local anesthesia.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 47-cm double-lumen 5-French PICC
     through the left brachial vein with the tip terminating in the distal superior
     vena cava.  The line is ready for use.

     NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT.
     
     Exam is compared to prior study of [**2825-5-14**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The exam is somewhat motion limited.  Especially in the middle
     portion of the study, there is no definite evidence of mass effect or
     hemorrhage.  Ventricles and sulci remain moderate mildly prominent consistent
     with mild brain atrophy.  The paranasal sinuses are incompletely visualized
     but there is some soft tissue thickening in the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses.
     This was true to on the previous examination.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Somewhat motion limited study.  No evidence of acute mass or
     hemorrhage.

     fungemia, followup iliacus and psoas hematomas.
     
     COMPARISONS:  CT torso of [**2825-5-29**] and CT torso of [**2825-4-18**].
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images through the abdomen and pelvis with oral but
     without IV contrast.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Persisting left lower lobe consolidation with
     small stable bilateral pleural effusions.  Within the left lower lobe
     consolidation, there is a linear hyperdensity, which was present on multiple
     prior CTs but appears more prominent on the current study.  This may represent
     a calcified granuloma with adjacent streak artifact though, it is difficult to
     further characterize.  Coronary artery calcification.  Moderately-distended
     gallbladder with dependent sludge.  G-tube appears well positioned. Ill-
     defined hypodense lesions in the right lobe of the liver and kidneys are not
     well characterized on this non-contrast study.  Diffuse pancreatic parenchymal
     calcifications likely the sequela of chronic pancreatitis.
     
     CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Stable size and appearance of hematomas
     involving the iliacus muscles bilaterally and the left psoas muscle.  These
     are unchanged from [**2825-5-29**].  Foley catheter in the non-distended bladder.
     Incidental note made of penile prosthetic with indwelling reservoir.  Lytic
     lesions involving the iliac bones bilaterally represent sites of prior bone
     graft harvest.

     to the skin with a StatLock device.  A final fluoroscopic image confirmed
     catheter tip position within the distal SVC.  The patient tolerated the
     procedure well, and there were no procedural or immediate post- procedural
     complications.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  1% lidocaine for local anesthesia.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 47-cm double-lumen 5-French PICC
     through the left brachial vein with the tip terminating in the distal superior
     vena cava.  The line is ready for use.

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Fever, elevated white count, and apparent liver
     enlargement.
     
     COMPARISON STUDY:  CT abdomen on [**2825-6-3**].
     
     The liver is normal in size and echotexture, showing no signs of enlargement
     nor any evidence of focal liver masses.  The gallbladder is moderately
     distended, probably reflecting a prolonged fasting state, but there are no
     stones nor any signs of acute cholecystitis or sludge.  Color flow Doppler
     shows patent portal veins with forward flow and patent hepatic veins.  There
     is no evidence of ascites or right pleural effusion, and the right kidney
     shows no signs of hydronephrosis or stones.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Negative right upper quadrant ultrasound.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      70 year old man with recent C7 fracture s/p operative repair complicated by 
      MRSA infection/fluid collection at the site, MRSA meningitis, now here with 
      sepsis.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please evaluate for repeat fluid collection at C7 (compare to prior), signs of 
      infection.
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     EXAM:  MRI cervical spine.
     
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with C7 fracture and postoperative repair
     complicated by MRSA infection and fluid collection with meningitis now healed
     with sepsis for further evaluation to exclude repeat fluid collection.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and T1 and T2 axial images
     of the cervical spine were obtained before gadolinium.  T1 sagittal and axial
     images were obtained following gadolinium.  Comparison was made with the
     previous MRI examinations of [**2825-5-15**] and [**2825-5-3**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Again laminectomies are seen at C6 and C7 level.  There is no
     evidence of recurrent fluid collection seen at this level.  There is no
     evidence of new epidural abscess identified in the cervical region or fluid
     collection noted within the spinal canal or paraspinal region.
     
     There remains a deformity of the spinal cord at the laminectomy site with
     spinal cord adherent to the laminectomy site.  There is increased signal seen
     within the spinal cord at C7 level which is confirmed on axial images and
     could represent myelomalacia.
     
     Note is made of prominent low signal on T1- and T2-weighted images anterior to
     the spinal cord from C5 to T2 level which is seen only on the sagittal images
     but not visualized on the axial images and is secondary to CSF pulsation
     artifacts.
     
     Multilevel degenerative changes are noted.  There is no evidence of abnormal
     enhancement of the spinal cord seen.  Postoperative changes are seen with
     metallic screws on the left at C6 and C7 level.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of new fluid collection seen or an area of new
     enhancement identified.  Focal increased signal seen within the spinal cord at
     C7 level which could be secondary to myelomalacia.  No evidence of discitis or
     osteomyelitis.  Continued mild increased signal within the posterior soft
     tissues at the laminectomy site could be due to inflammatory changes without
     evidence of focal fluid collection.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     EXAMINATION:  AP chest.
     
     INDICATION:  Fever, increasing white count.
     
     Single AP view of the chest is obtained on [**2825-9-12**] at 16:10 hours and is
     compared with prior radiograph performed on [**2825-6-18**].  The heart is not
     enlarged.  There is evidence of prior cardiac surgery.  The lung fields show a
     patchy opacity at the left base, likely in the left lower lobe. Unfortunately,
     the left lateral portion of the lower chest is not included fully on the
     current examination.  No other acute change is noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Patchy increase in density in the left lower lung field may represent early
     pneumonia given the patient's history.  Since the examination is suboptimal, I
     would obtain a PA and lateral views of the chest for confirmation.  Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 1677**] was contacted at 5:05 p.m.  He will order a repeat AP view.

     obtained approximately one hour earlier and to [**2825-6-18**].
     
     The patient is status post midline sternotomy and CABG.  The heart is normal
     in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.
     There is an increased opacity in the left lung base.  This has been seen on
     prior radiographs dating back to [**2825-5-26**] and may represent resolving
     consolidation or longstanding atelectasis. No pleural effusions are apparent.
     No pneumothorax is seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe opacity, imoproving; this may represent resolving
     left lower lobe pneumonia or atelectasis.

     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The patient was brought to the angiography table.
     Right upper arm was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Right
     basilic vein was identified which was patent and compressible.  Right basilic
     vein was punctured under ultrasound guidance, and 0.018 guide wire was
     inserted over the needle.  Pre- and post-ultrasound images obtained.  The
     needle was exchanged with the micropuncture sheath, and 29 cm 4 French single
     lumen PICC line was inserted over the wire, with the tip terminating in distal
     SVC under flouroscopic guidance.  The line was flushed, heplocked, and
     StatLocked. The line is ready for use.  There was no immediate complication.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of 29 cm 4 French single lumen PICC line
     from right basilic vein with the tip terminating in distal SVC.  The line is
     ready for use.

     Reason: interval change                                             
     Admitting Diagnosis: SEPSIS, R/O MI
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
       71 yo man with persistent hypoxia.                                             
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      interval change

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Persistent hypoxia.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2825-12-22**].
     
     UPRIGHT FRONTAL CHEST:  There has been interval improvement in the previously
     identified severe pulmonary edema.  Perihilar vascular congestion persists. In
     addition, there is increased interstitial opacity throughout the right upper
     lobe, which could either relate to asymmetric pulmonary edema which remains or
     possibly infection.  No pleural effusions are seen at this time. The patient
     is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The cardiac and mediastinal
     contours are unchanged.  Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity persists.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Improvement in the degree of pulmonary edema.  Persistent interstitial
     abnormality, predominantly in the right upper lung, which is likely asymmetric
     interstitial edema.
