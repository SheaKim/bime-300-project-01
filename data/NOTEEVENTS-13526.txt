HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 86 year old male with
history of advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer,
elevated PSA and possible bone mets who presented with fever
and substernal chest pain on [**3047-1-9**].  The patient was a
poor historian on admission and the details of his history
were not clear.  The patient had a recent bone scan due to an
elevated PSA and since then has been complaining of increased
fatigue.  On the day of admission, the patient had increased
lethargy and he was found to be febrile at his assisted
living.

The patient did not note fevers, chills or chest pain but
does not chest pain of unclear characterization.  The patient
reports it to be right shoulder pain without elaboration.
The patient's wife reports shaking and mild abdominal pain
yesterday.  The patient denies dysuria, headache, shortness
of breath, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.

In the ER, the patient was found to be hypoxic.  He was given
IV Lasix when his chest x-ray showed flash pulmonary edema.
He was also hypertensive and had received some Nitropaste.
He then became hypotensive and required a 500 cc normal
saline bolus and then was transferred to the MICU.

The patient was aggressively volume resuscitated prior to
transfer with three liters as his systolic blood pressures
were not being maintained.  He was also given 2 grams of
Ceftriaxone IV times one.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Advanced prostate cancer status post XRT and
chemotherapy, last PSA 55.  He has been treated with Lupron,
Casodex and Ketoconazole.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Cataracts.
4.  Dementia.
5.  Glaucoma.
6.  Gout.
7.  History of cholestasis and jaundice.
8.  Hypertension.

MEDICATIONS:  Flomax 0.4 qd, Protonix 40 po qd, Celexa 10 po
qd, TUMS 500 po qd, Nitroglycerin prn, Cosopt 1 gtt each eye.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married times 56 years and
lives with his wife at assisted living called [**Location (un) 5736**].
He does not smoke, quit 50 years ago and has approximately
one drink per day but recently quit.

FAMILY HISTORY:  His father died of stomach cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs show temperature of 102.9,
pulse 83, blood pressure 119/39, breaths 19, satting 98% on
room air.  In general he is an elderly, somewhat confused
male, agitated, moves frequently in bed.  HEENT:  PERRL,
EOMI.  Sclera nonicteric, mildly dry mucous membranes.  Neck
is supple, difficult to appreciate JVP.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Pulmonary:  Upper airway transmitted sounds with some
wheezing, slightly tachypneic, otherwise clear.  Abdomen:
Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender.  Extremities:  No
cyanosis, clubbing or edema, 1+ pedal pulses.  Neurologic:
Oriented to hospital, self, [**5-25**] motor and lower extremities.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Sepsis:  On admission the patient's blood cultures were
positive for gram-negative rods in 2/4 bottles which later
grew out to be E. coli which where pansensitive.  The
patient's urine culture also grew E. coli.  The patient was
found to have sepsis secondary to a UTI.  The patient
required Dopamine transiently on admission to the MICU due to
low blood pressures but then improved and his Dopa was weaned
on day two of his MICU stay.  The patient was treated with
Levo and Ceftriaxone initially on [**1-12**] after his cultures
and sensitivities as being sensitive to quinolones.  His
Ceftriaxone was discontinued.  The patient will be treated
with a three week course of Levaquin.

On admission the patient had been complaining of chest pain
and his troponins showed him to have an acute non Q wave MI
though his CKs were not elevated.  His cardiac ischemia was
thought to be secondary to demand.  He was started on a
Heparin drip times 48 hours as per Cardiology's
recommendations.  He was also continued on aspirin, beta
blocker and on the day of discharge the patient was also
started on an ACE.  The patient was noted to have ST
elevations on day two of his MICU stay.  While he denied
further chest pain, the patient was continued on the Heparin
drip.  This was discontinued on [**3047-1-12**].

The patient had a subsequent echocardiogram which
demonstrated a depressed EF of 25% to 30% with severe left
ventricular dysfunction and a marked anterior akinesis.  On
discussing with the patient's attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], it was
decided that given the patient's advanced metastatic disease,
anticoagulation would not be started on the patient such as
Coumadin.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient was desatting on admission and
required some oxygen due to aggressive volume repletion for
hypotension.  On discharge, the patient's room air stats were
96%.

3.  Hypoglycemia:  The patient had some episodes of
hypoglycemia in the MICU which was attributed to sepsis.  The
patient has no history of diabetes so the patient was placed
on an sliding scale of insulin.  This will be stopped as the
patient is going to rehab and we are recommending that his
blood sugars are checked while fasting to prevent
hypoglycemia.

4.  Prostate cancer:  The patient likely had bone mets from a
recent bone scan.  The plan was for the patient to have
continued hormonal therapy or chemo but this will be decided
by his outpatient oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 294**].  The patient had
some episodes of hematuria after his Foley was discontinued.
The Foley was replaced when the patient failed a voiding
trial and then discontinued again and the patient had no
further hematuria but this should be followed up after the
patient is discharged.

5.  Dementia:  The patient had some episodes of sundowning
while in the hospital however this was not worse than his
baseline and not surprising considering his recent sepsis.

6.  Code status:  The patient was DNR/DNI while in the
hospital however the patient did accept pressors and required
them d[**MD Number 278**] his MICU stay.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient's condition is stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Sepsis secondary to UTI, bacteremia,
acute MI.

FOLLOW UP PLAN:  The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 294**] on [**3047-2-23**] at 10:30 in the Heme Onc Clinic.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  ASA 325 one po qd, Calcium carbonate
500 mg one po qd, Protonix 40 mg one po qd, Metoprolol 25 mg
po bid, Tamsulosin 0.4 one po qd, Dorzolamide - Timolol 2.5%
one drop ophthalmic qd, Citalopram 20 mg one po qd,
Levofloxacin 500 mg po qd continued for a total of two week
course.

     INDICATION:  Wheezing and prostate cancer.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung apices through
     the pubic symphysis after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast.
     Precontrast and portal venous phase imaging through the liver were also
     obtained.
     
     150 cc of Optiray was administered and used secondary to patient's debility.
     
     COMPARISONS: [**3046-9-8**] abdomen and pelvis only.
     
     CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  The heart is mildly enlarged. There are coronary
     artery calcifications. The pericardium and great vessels are unremarkable.
     There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy. There are small
     to moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectatic changes at
     the lung bases.  The lungs are otherwise clear. The airways are patent through
     the segmental levels bilaterally.  There is gynecomastia.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder, spleen, atrophic pancreas,
     adrenals, left kidney, ureters and small bowel loops are unremarkable.  There
     is a stable approximately 3 cm simple cyst in the mid right kidney which is
     otherwise unremarkable.  The colon is normal.  There is a trace amount of
     fluid along the paracolic gutter on the right as well as tracking anterior to
     the lower left psoas muscle.  Calcifications are noted in the region of the
     takeoff of the celiac artery and SMA and calcifications are noted in the
     splenic artery. Calcified lymph nodes are again noted in the mesentery on the
     right.  There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  A few diverticulae are noted in the sigmoid colon.
     Rectum is unremarkable.  The urinary bladder is notable for small bladder
     diverticulae anteriorly. The prostate gland is again noted to be enlarged and
     heterogeneous with a lobular low attenuation protrusion along the left
     posterolateral aspect.  Small iliac chain lymph nodes are again noted and
     unchanged since the prior study.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are asymmetric foci of sclerosis involving the T6
     pedicle, the left aspect of the manubrium and the anterolateral left 5th rib
     which correspond to foci of increased tracer activity on the recent bone scan
                                                                 (Over)

     of [**3047-1-7**] and are consistent with osseous metastases.  There are fractures
     of the right posterior 6th, 7th and 8th ribs which were in part seen on the
     previous CT scan dating back to [**3046-8-4**].  These fractures correspond to foci
     of increased tracer uptake on the bone scan.  No foci suspicious for
     metastatic disease are noted in the acromioclavicular region or in the lumbar
     spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
     2) Stable appearance of enlarged heterogeneous prostate gland with a lobular
     component extending from the left posterolateral aspect.  No associated
     lymphadenopathy.  There are findings consistent with osseous metastases
     involving the left aspect of the manubrium, T6 vertebral body, and
     anterolateral aspect of the left 5th rib (these correspond with findings on
     recent bone scan).
     3) Right rib fractures which date back to [**3046-7-21**].
     4) Vasculopathy.
     5) Gynecomastia.
