                                     FINAL REPORT
     HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST
     
     INDICATION:  Confusion and change in mental status.
     
     Multiple axial images are obtained from base to vertex without intravenous
     contrast administration.  The exam is partially degraded by motion artifact.
     
     There is a focal area of low density and attenuation involving the right
     middle cerebellar peduncle along the anterior aspect of the right inferior
     cerebellar hemisphere suspicious for a small infarct.  This could be confirmed
     by obtaining an MRI of the brain.  A second area of low density is seen more
     posteriorly also within the right cerebellar hemisphere.  Scattered low
     attenuation is noted along the periventricular white matter suggestive of
     chronic microvascular ischemic or gliotic changes.  There is generalized
     sulcal dilatation consistent with cortical atrophy.  Few scattered lacunar
     infarcts are seen within the right basal ganglia.  There is no midline shift
     or mass effect.  The calvarium is intact.  No fractures or subdural hemorrhage
     is noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Suspicion for two small low densities involving the right
     anterior and inferior aspect of the right cerebellar hemisphere suggestive of
     small infarct.  Correlation with MRI and diffusion images could be helpful. No
     acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage is noted.

     INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
     
     PA AND LATERAL CHEST:  Comparison is made to study dated [**3229-5-12**]. Heart
     size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.  The pulmonary vasculature is not
     engorged.  In the interval, there has been resolution of previously evident
     confluent and nodular areas of airspace opacity throughout both lungs.
     However, persistent patchy opacity at the right lung base as well as more
     linear opacity at the left lung base is consistent with atelectasis.  Osseous
     structures are notable for multiple compression deformities of the distal
     thoracic spine, some of which were present at prior study and others which
     were not included.  A lumbar scoliosis convex to the right.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Patchy right basilar airspace opacity concerning for early
     pneumonia.

History of Present Illness:
82 yo woman with Alzheimer's dementia, h/o PE in [**3228**] on 
coumadin(but INR 1.1 on admission), osteoporosis, h/o chronic 
back pain with T10/T12/L1 comp fx and L5/S1 disc herniation, 
chronic pain with multiple recent admissions for somnolence [**2-28**] 
narcotics, and hx asp pna, who was admitted from NH s/p fall. 
Per reports, the patient was watching TV and then was found on 
hands and knees on the floor, but had no witnessed fall. She was 
c/o R LE pain.  
.
In ED, VS 96.6 88 134/86 18 96%RA. Right hip showed minimally 
displaced fracture of the femoral neck. CXR showed LLL opacity 
concerning for early pna vs atelectasis. She received a total of 
12 mg of Morphine, Levofloxacin 500 mg IV (given ? of asp pna), 
Phenergan, Anzemet given for episode of emesis.  At this point 
the pt became somewhat somnolent, and the APG attg noted a new ? 
facial droop.  It was determined that she needed a head CT prior 
to the OR.  Her oxygen saturation (baseline 93-96% on RA) was 
93-94% on RA, but reportedly dropped to the 80s although there 
is a ? of whether this was a poor tracing.  She received 
naloxone for her mental status which resulted in a transient 
improvement.  She was then intubated for her head CT (which was 
neg) and transferred to the MICU for further management.  Upon 
intubation there was some question of whether gastric contents 
vs. sputum were sxned from her ETT. 
 
Past Medical History:
1. Alzheimer's Dementia  
2. Severe back pain: MRI [**3229-4-27**] showing T10, T12, L1

Radiology:
[**3229-12-3**]: CHest Pa/Lat - The heart size is normal, and there is 
no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.  Previously reported 
patchy opacity at the right lung base has cleared in the 
interval with only minimal residual linear opacity remaining in 
this area.  However, there is a questionable new area of patchy 
opacification peripherally in the left lower lobe as compared to 
previous study. The bones are diffusely demineralized.  There 
are stable compression 
deformities in the lower thoracic spine. 
.
[**3229-12-3**]: Portable Chest - There has been interval placement of 
an 
endotracheal tube with the tip at the level of the clavicles.  
The cardiac silhouette, mediastinal, and hilar contours are 
normal.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Both lungs are 
clear without consolidations or effusions.  The surrounding soft 
tissue and osseous structures reveal severe osteopenia and 
degenerative changes along the thoracic spine.  There is no free 
air under bilateral hemidiaphragms. 
.
[**3229-12-5**]: Right Hip: FINDINGS:  A single intraoperative AP 
radiograph of the pelvis was obtained demonstrating interval 
bipolar hemiarthroplasty of the right hip with good alignment.  
Skin staples are noted overlying the lateral pelvis.  Diffuse 
osteopenia is noted.  There is a left femoral axis venous 
catheter.  The left hip joint is unremarkable.   
IMPRESSION:  Status post right bipolar hemiarthroplasty, in good 
alignment.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Right hip fracture: Patient was admitted to MICU after 
intubation in the ED awaiting repair for right hip fracture. The 
patient was on anticoagulation therapy with coumadin on 
admission with an INR of 1.5 at it's peak. The patient was given 
IV vitamin K and FFP for reversal of anticoagulation. The 
patient was noted after admission to have small Hct drop form 
27.7 to 23.5 for which she was given PO 1U PRBCs with 
appropriate bump. Upon successful reversal of anticoagulation, 
the patient was taken to the OR two days after admission to the 
MICU with successful right hemiarthroplasty of the right hip. 
Intraoperatively and perioperatively the patient received 400mg 
Fentanyl and did not require any transfusions per report from 
operating team. The patient was trasnferred back to the MICU for 
ongoing care and was started on lovenox 40mg SC qd as 
recommended by ortho (alternatively could use SC Hep tid as 
well).
   On the floor, the Lovenox was increased to 40 mg SC BID, a 
therapeutic dose, due to concern over prior PE in [**3228**]. This was 
continued without incident, although she was briefly changed to 
IV Heparin before and after her PEG was placed. She will be 
discharged with plan to continue Lovenox until she is 
therapeutic on Coumadin (i.e. 2 days after her INR is >2.0). PT 
was started and proceeded smoothly. 
.  
#. ID - The patient was admitted to the MICU intubated for 
airway protection in setting of mental status changes after 
receiving morphine, but with additional concern towards 
aspiration given some vomiting. The patient's chest film on 
admission did not demonstrate any definite infiltrates or 
consolidations. Additionally the patient did not develop any 
leukocytosis. However, on the evening of admission the patient 
did have a fever with additional temp spike to 102 the am of her 
operation. The patient had a UA which was significant for small 
leuk esterase, many bacteria and > 50WBC. Therefore, the night 
prior to her operation the patient was started on levofloxacin 
25mg IV q12, which was increased to 50mg the following day. 
Urine cultures were remarkable for only yeast however without 
any appreciable growth. The patient addiitonally had blood 
cultures none of which demonstrated any growth. Sputum cultures 
x 2 were sent with gram stain remarkable for 2+ GPC and 1+ GNR, 
however with only sparse oropharyngela flora growing in 
cultures. 
   Blood Cx drawn [**12-3**], however, grew out GNR which eventually 
were determined to be Clostridia. Patient was started on 
Cefipime and Flagyl IV. She remained afebrile and without 
elevated WBC throughout her stay once the antibiotics were 
started. Further blood cxs were all negative. It is unclear 
whether the GNR was ""real"" or a contaminant. She will be D/C'd 
on a 14 day course of po Cipro/Flagyl (D/C day [**8-9**]). 
.
#. CV: Patient was mildly hypertensive, but on transfer from 
MICU to floor she became persistently hypotensive, with SBP 
80-90. The hypotension was of unclear etiology. Most likely 
hypovolemia, as FeNa < 1%, Uop responded to fluids. Heart 
failure unlikely given nl CXR, lack of elevated JVP or LE edema, 
but BNP>3000. She had some EKG changes (apparently new Q waves 
in the precordial leads) but was ruled out for MI. Concern for 
sepsis but no new O2 requirement, not tachycardic, no fevers. 
[**Last Name (un) 472**] stim test wnl. ABG was normal. Echo done showed some 
diastolic dysfunction, but EF 65 and no other abnormality. Over 
the course of 48 hours she received several liters of NS, both 
in bolus and continuous form, and finally her blood pressure 
stabilized and urine output improved. For the remained of her 
hospital stay, she was normotensive with adequate urine output. 
Toprol and HCTZ were held.
.
#. Heme: On the floor, the patient was persistently anemic. She 
stayed just above her transfusion goal of 28, however after 
receiving several liters of fluid her HCT dropped to 25 and then 
was stable. On [**12-10**] she was transfused 1 Unit of pRBC's [**12-10**], 
and she remained with a HCT>30 for the duration of her stay.
.
#. Nephrology: Patient had approximately 48 hours of low urine 
output in setting of above mentioned hypotension. Probably 
pre-renal, w/ FeNA .37%. Urine sediment shows no evidence of 
ATN. After receiving fluids, her urine output improved 
dramatically and remained [**Doctor First Name **].
.
#. FEN: There was significant concern for aspiration PNA, and 
she was fed via NG tube. In the course of a speech and swallow 
consult, Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9383**] [**Last Name (Titles) 9384**] aspirated Custard, became hypoxic 
and developed an additional O2 requirement (2L to 4L). Gi was 
consulted, and in discussions with her health care proxy it was 
determined that she needed a PEG. This was done without 
complication on [**12-12**]. She tolerated the procedure and 
subsequent tube feeds well before discharge. 
.
#. Alzheimer's Dementia. The patient was continued on her 
outpatient dose of Aricept.  
.    
#. Hypothyroidism. Patient was continued on her outpatient dose 
of Levoxyl 75 mcg po daily. Repeat TSH testing was considered 
but deferred given inability to interpet the findings well in an 
acutely ill patient.

     pneumonia.  History of aspiration pneumonia.
     
     The heart size is normal, and there is no mediastinal or hilar
     lymphadenopathy.  Previously reported patchy opacity at the right lung base
     has cleared in the interval with only minimal residual linear opacity
     remaining in this area.  However, there is a questionable new area of patchy
     opacification peripherally in the left lower lobe as compared to previous
     study.
     
     The bones are diffusely demineralized.  There are stable compression
     deformities in the lower thoracic spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:  New patchy opacity in periphery of left lung base, which may be
     due to focal atelectasis or early pneumonia.  Followup radiographs may be
     helpful.
