Admission Date:  [**2866-9-24**]     Discharge Date:  [**2866-10-9**]

Date of Birth:   [**2786-10-13**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79-year-old
male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease
with angina, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
who was initially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital in
[**Location (un) 1632**] for shortness of breath, substernal chest pain,
and diaphoresis.  Cardiac catheterization there showed
3-vessel disease with left main 70% occlusion, right coronary
artery 100% occlusion, left circumflex 90% occlusion, left
anterior descending artery 80% to 90% occlusion, with an
ejection fraction of 65%.

The patient was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 392**] for possible coronary artery bypass
graft.  On admission, he was noted to have ecchymosis in his
left groin site which was where the initial catheterization
was attempted at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital and his left upper
extremity site where catheterization was finally performed at
the outside hospital.

On [**9-25**], the patient had an episode of syncope while on
the commode with accompanying hypotension and was transferred
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further care.  The
episode was thought to be secondary to vasovagal syncope.
While on the Medical Intensive Care Unit Service he had
another episode of syncope.  Additionally, he has had several
episodes of anginal-type chest pain relieved by
nitroglycerin.  The expanding hematoma in the left arm was
complicated by superimposed cellulitis, and he was started on
oxacillin and eventually switched to p.o. Levaquin.  The left
groin hematoma also continued to expand.  He has required
several blood transfusions due to his hematocrit drop.
Cardiothoracic Surgery felt that the patient was not a good
surgical candidate given his severe chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.

Subsequently, the patient underwent high-risk angioplasty.
His cardiac catheterization showed left main stenosis of 50%,
left circumflex was stented.  His course was complicated by
hypotension secondary to cardiac tamponade.  A pericardial
drain was placed which drained 700 cc of frank blood.  His
hypotension resolved with dopamine and pericardial drainage.
He also sustained a right iliac dissection which was stented
at the end of the procedure.

Following his cardiac catheterization, the patient was
transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells and 2 units of
fresh frozen plasma and transferred to the Coronary Care
Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Peripheral vascular disease with claudication.
4.  Status post bilateral carotid endarterectomy.
5.  Peptic ulcer disease.
6.  Arthritis.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Protonix, Atrovent, Levaquin,
Beconase, Lipitor, nitroglycerin drip, Colace, aspirin,
Lopressor, and Atrovent nebulizers.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature 97,
pulse 94, blood pressure 133/51, respiratory rate 20,
saturation 93% on 2 liters of oxygen through nasal cannula.
Drips with dopamine and intravenous fluids.  In general,
somnolent but arousable.  HEENT revealed pupils were equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation, but enlarged
to 6 mm, dry mucous membranes, sclerae were anicteric, no
jugular venous distention.  Bilateral scars at carotids.
Cardiovascular had distant heart sounds.  Pulmonary was clear
anteriorly.  Abdominal examination was nontender and
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities had severe
ecchymoses of the left upper extremity, right upper
extremity, bilateral flanks.  Skin breakdown on right arm,
draining serosanguineous fluid.

LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count
15.1, hematocrit 31.2, platelets 186.  Sodium 137, potassium
4, chloride 100, bicarbonate 31, BUN 25, creatinine 0.9,
glucose of 108.  INR 1.2, PTT 26.8, PT 13.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient has had a tenuous course
from a cardiovascular standpoint.  After the catheterization
the patient continued to drain frank blood from the
pericardial drain requiring several units of packed red blood
cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets.  His aspirin and
Plavix were held during this episode.  The bleeding
eventually stopped as documented by serial echocardiograms,
and the pericardial catheter was removed without any
complications.  He was eventually weaned off the dopamine.
He was gradually started on Lopressor and Captopril.  The
Lopressor dosage titration was limited by worsening shortness
of breath.  He continued to have paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, controlled by Lopressor and diltiazem.  He also
continued to have intermittent chest pain with no
electrocardiogram changes and some relief with sublingual
nitroglycerin.  Additionally, he has had episodes of
hypotension which have been responsive to fluid boluses.  It
is likely the result of multiple medications and fluid
depletion.

In light of his recurrent hypotension, the captopril was
discontinued.  He continued to be on aspirin and Plavix.  His
last echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of greater
than 55%, and no signs of tamponade.

2.  PULMONARY:  He continued to be on 2 liters of
supplemental oxygen with saturations of 92% to 93%.  He
continued his Atrovent nebulizers, Atrovent MDI, and Medrol.

3.  DERMATOLOGY:  On the Medical Intensive Care Unit Service
he was treated with Levaquin for possible cellulitis.
However, it was discontinued in light of no source of
infection.  He continued to have severe ecchymoses of his
extremities and groin.  The effected areas had gotten
slightly better over the course of his stay.  He has had skin
breakdown in his right arm.  The wound cultures have been
negative.  The friable skin is likely secondary to long-term
steroid use.

4.  GENITOURINARY:  The patient's flank hematoma tracked down
to his testicular and penile area.  The ecchymosis is
currently stable and not expanding.  The testicular edema was
unchanged.  He has had a urinary tract infection and being
treated with a 10-day course of ciprofloxacin.

5.  HEMATOLOGY:  His hematocrit has been stable since removal
of his pericardial catheter.

6.  CODE STATUS:  The patient is do not resuscitate/do not
intubate.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease with 3-vessel disease, status
post stent times two to his left circumflex artery.
2.  Urinary tract infection.
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
4.  Peripheral vascular disease.
5.  Arthritis.
6.  Status post carotid endarterectomy.

     UNENHANCED HEAD CT:  There are no intra- or extra-axial fluid collections.
     There is no shift of midline structures or mass effect.  Diffuse
     periventricular low attenuation does not appear to be associated with
     significant sulcal effacement, and therefore probably represents extensive
     diffuse chronic microvascular ischemia.  
     Soft tissue and osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
     2.  Diffuse periventricular low attenuation, consistent with probable chronic

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.  COUGH.  SHORTNESS OF BREATH.
     
     A right subclavian central venous catheter remains in place.  No pneumothorax
     is evident.  The heart size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.
     
     The lungs demonstrates overall paucity of vessels in the upper zone suggesting
     emphysema.  There is apparent new increased opacity in the right lower lung
     zone.  There is stable slight blunting of right costophrenic sulcus likely due
     to scar.  The left lung remains clear.
     
     IMPRESSION:  New confluent right lower lobe opacity.  In the appropriate
     clinical setting, this may reflect a focus of aspiration or early pneumonia.
     Pathcy atelectasis is also possible.
