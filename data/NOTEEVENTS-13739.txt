Date of Birth:   [**2602-1-12**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CMED

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Congestive heart failure and acute non ST
elevation myocardial infarction status post catheterization.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59 year-old
female with a past medical history of diabetes, peripheral
vascular disease, chronic renal insufficiency, 1999 stent to
the left anterior descending coronary artery, in 8/99 rota of
the obtuse marginal, and [**11/2657**] percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty of the LPDA, percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty of the obtuse marginal one, status post
unsuccessful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty

circumflex who awoke from [**Doctor Last Name 292**] today with 8 to 10 anginal
equivalent pain, nonradiating and positive shortness of
breath, positive diaphoresis with the pain that was
nonpleuritic.  The pain, which normally resolve with one
nitroglycerin did not resolve with three nitroglycerin.  The
patient called EMS and was brought to an outside hospital.

creatinine 2.5, potassium 4.5, glucose 237.  Her CK was 116
with an MB fraction of 5.3 and her troponin was 4.1.  Chest
x-ray was consistent with failure.

PERTINENT PREVIOUS STUDIES:  In [**2656**] stent to the left
anterior descending coronary artery, 1999 rota of the obtuse
marginal and [**11/2657**] percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty of the LPDA and a percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty of the obtuse marginal one.  Status post
unsuccessful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
of the proximal obtuse marginal one and [**12-13**] cipher to
circumflex.

CURRENT STUDIES IN HOUSE:  Catheterization report, which
showed three vessel disease, patent left circumflex stent,
cardiac output of 6.60, cardiac index of 3.28, capillary
wedge pressure of 34, right atrial pressure of 7 and
pulmonary artery pressure 46.  Her left main coronary artery
showed no obstruction.  Her left anterior descending coronary
artery showed mild disease, left circumflex showed subtotal
obtuse marginal severely diseased before stenting and with
current collateralization.  Her right coronary artery showed
small nondominant 50% occlusion in the middle vessel and the
recommendations status post catheterization were medical
management.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs when seeing the patient
were blood pressure 140/60.  Heart rate 74.  Respiratory rate
20.  Satting 99% on 3 liters.  She was an elderly female
lying in bed in no acute distress.  Face mask on.  Able to
speak in full sentences.  No JVD.  Regular rate and rhythm.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Bilateral crackles [**3-14**] of the
way up.  1+ bilateral lower extremity edema.  Alert and
oriented times three.  Groin site with no hematoma or oozing.


HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially evaluated in the
holding room after catheterization.  At this point she was
satting 97 to 99% on 3 liters and looked relatively
comfortable.  Upon arrival to the floor the patient had a
moment of desaturation.  She went down to the high 80s, which
was resolved after positioning the patient in a better
position.  The patient also suffered from nausea during the
first evening on the floor, which resolved with the
application of Zofran and Ativan.  The next day after arrival
to the floor it was noted that the patient's urine output had
decreased and the patient's creatinine had bumped from her
baseline around 2 to over 3.  The Renal Service was consulted
and they felt that the patient would require emergent
hemodialysis to combat the acute renal failure.  The patient
was transferred to the CCU where she underwent hemodialysis
on two of the three days that she stayed in the unit.  The
first day 4.7 liters of fluid were removed from the patient
and on the third day an additional 2 liters were removed from
the patient.  During her time in the unit the patient had one
bout of chest pain 4 out of 10, which lasted approximately 20
minutes, which resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin.  After
significant clinical improvement the patient was transferred
to the floor for further care.

After return to the floor the patient's creatinine came back
down from a high of 4.9 down to approximately 3.  At this
point the patient had no other complaints of chest pain,
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, fevers or chills and
began to put out better urine output.  Over the next few days
her creatinine slowly increased from 3 to 3.3 to 3.5 and
finally on the day of discharge 3.4.  Renal continued to
follow the patient and felt that dialysis was not needed at
this point, however, they would continue to monitor her urine
output as well as creatinine.  Their thought was that her
acute on chronic renal failure was probably secondary to
contrast nephropathy, which resulted from the contrast dye
given during catheterization.

1.  Non ST elevation myocardial infarction:  The patient
arrived without chest pain, but had a history of chest pain,
electrocardiogram changes and positive enzymes.  She also had
multiple risk factors as well.  The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization (see report above), but no intervention
occurred during the catheterization.  An echocardiogram while
in house showed an ejection fraction of 35 to 40%, which was
worse from an echocardiogram done two years ago, which showed
an ejection fraction of 40 to 45%.  On [**4-14**] three days before
discharge her CK and troponin had a significant increase
after trending down for the rest of her hospital stay.  The
following two days the CK and troponin both went back down
with no further chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea or
vomiting.

2.  Congestive heart failure:  The patient's initial chest
x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure.  Prior to
the CCU admission the patient was given Lasix and was
responsive, however, the day that she was transferred to the
CCU her urine output dropped off despite the application of
120 mg of Lasix.  Now that the patient is no longer being
dialyzed and is back in the CCU her urine output is once
again responsive to Lasix.  Her clinical examination has
drastically improved from admission with only very small
crackles at the bases remaining.  She is satting well on room
air currently.

3.  Hypoxia:  The patient was on 3 liters of nasal cannula.
This most likely was secondary to congestive heart failure
and pulmonary edema.  After the significant diuresis by
dialysis as well as the good urine output over the last few
days of her hospital stay the patient continues to sat well
on room air with no other respiratory issues.

4.  Chronic renal insufficiency:  The patient's creatinine is
slightly up from baseline, however, she continues to have
good urine output and his Lasix responding.  Her creatinine
appears to be stable and slightly decreasing now at a level
near 3.5.  It will be sometime to determine whether she will
return back to her baseline or whether she will develop a new
baseline slightly higher then prior.

5.  Diabetes mellitus:  The patient had no issues during her
hospital stay.  Her control was adequate during her hospital
stay with no need for any acute intervention.

6.  High blood pressure:  The patient was put on her normal
blood pressure medications and her blood pressure was
controlled adequately throughout her hospital stay.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehab for cardiopulmonary rehab as well
as physical therapy.  The patient is significantly
deconditioned after spending this much time in the hospital.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Non ST elevation myocardial infarction.
2.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
3.  Acute renal failure.
4.  Congestive heart failure.
5.  Hypoxia.
6.  Diabetes mellitus.
7.  Hypertension.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 po q day.
2.  Plavix 75 mg po q day.
3.  Gabapentin 400 mg po t.i.d.
4.  Levothyroxine 112 micrograms one po q day.
5.  Isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg sustained release one q.d.
6.  Carvedilol 12.5 tablets two po b.i.d.
7.  Atorvastatin 40 mg one po q.d.
8.  Furosemide 80 mg one po q.d.

FOLLOW UP PLANS:  The patient will initially go to rehab for
an unknown amount of time.  The patient will then follow up
with her cardiolgoist in three to five days.  The patient
will also follow up with her primary care physician at this
point.

     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Dr[**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 2633**] and [**Doctor Last Name 85**].  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 85**] the
     attending radiologist was present and supervised the entire procedure.
     
     The left upper arm was prepped in a sterile fashion.  Since no suitable veins
     were visible, ultrasound was used for localization of a suitable vein.  The
     basilic vein was visible under sonographic evaluation, and was patent and
     compressible.  After local anesthesia with 2 cc of 1% Lidocaine, the basilic
     vein was entered under sonographic guidance with a 21 gauge needle.  A 0.028
     guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena
     cava.  Based on the markers on the guidewire it was determined that a length
     of 44 cm would be suitable.  The PICC line was trimmed to length and advanced
     over a 4 French introducer sheath.  The sheath was removed.  The catheter was
     flushed.  A final chest x-ray was obtained.  The film demonstrates the tip to
     be in the superior vena cava just above the atrium.  The line is ready for
     use.  A STAT-lock was applied and the line was HEP-locked.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 44 cm total length 4 French single
     lumen PICC line with its tip in the superior vena cava, ready for use.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      59 year old woman with acute renal failure and chf requiring dialysis           
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      either side for iv access

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  59 year old woman with pneumonia and UTI requiring IV antibiotics.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Dr[**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 2633**] and [**Doctor Last Name 85**].  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 85**] the
     attending radiologist was present and supervised the entire procedure.
     
     The left upper arm was prepped in a sterile fashion.  Since no suitable veins
     were visible, ultrasound was used for localization of a suitable vein.  The
     basilic vein was visible under sonographic evaluation, and was patent and
     compressible.  After local anesthesia with 2 cc of 1% Lidocaine, the basilic
     vein was entered under sonographic guidance with a 21 gauge needle.  A 0.028
     guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena
     cava.  Based on the markers on the guidewire it was determined that a length
     of 44 cm would be suitable.  The PICC line was trimmed to length and advanced
     over a 4 French introducer sheath.  The sheath was removed.  The catheter was
     flushed.  A final chest x-ray was obtained.  The film demonstrates the tip to
     be in the superior vena cava just above the atrium.  The line is ready for
     use.  A STAT-lock was applied and the line was HEP-locked.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 44 cm total length 4 French single
     lumen PICC line with its tip in the superior vena cava, ready for use.

     HISTORY:  Chest pain evaluation. 
      
     SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB: 
     Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142  
     mg/kg/min. Two minutes after the cessation of infusion, Tc-99m sestamibi was
     administered IV. 
      
     INTERPRETATION:  
     Image Protocol: Gated SPECT. 
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium-201. 
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images. 
     The study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model. 
      
     There is left ventricular enlargement which is slightly more prominent during
     stress. 
     There is inferior and inferolateral moderate, reversible perfusion defect. 
     There is adjacent subdiaphragmatic radiotracer uptake on the rest images,
     however the reversible perfusion defect is felt to be real.   
      
     On gated SPECT images there is inferolateral mild hypokinesis.  Global left
     ventricular function is reduced with LVEF calculated to be 43%. 
      
     IMPRESSION:  1) Inducible ischemia in the inferior and inferolateral walls. 2)
     Mild inferolateral hypokinesis.  3) Left ventricular enlargement which is
     slightly more prominent during stress imaging with a calculated LVEF = 43%.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Acute renal failure in a patient with chronic renal
     insufficiency.
     
     Both kidneys are normal in size with the left kidney measuring 10.4 cm and the
     right 12.0 cm in length.  There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, renal
     stones, cysts, or masses.  Multiple hyperechoic foci in the central portion of
     both kidneys are noted due to renal artery calcifications.  The renal cortex
     appears well preserved but mildly increased in echogenicity, consistent with
     the known chronic parenchymal renal disease.  The bladder is unremarkable. 
     The findings are unchanged since prior scans from [**2659-1-28**].
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     Normal sized kidneys with increased echogenicity consistent with chronic
     parenchymal disease.  No evidence of obstruction.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      60 year old woman with c/p hx of mi                                             
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      wide mediastinum?

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  History of MI with chest pain.  Question wide mediastinum.
     
     COMPARISON:  Report of chest x-ray from [**2661-12-27**], as the images are not
     available.
     
     CHEST X-RAY, AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE:  Although the prior films are not presently
     available, the mediastinum appears unremarkable.  The heart is somewhat
     enlarged, but was probably better evaluated on the last PA and lateral film.
     The pulmonary vascularity is unremarkable, and the lungs are clear, other than
     some plate-like atelectasis in the left mid-lung zone or possibly scar.  There
     are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The osseous structures are
     unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of mediastinal widening or other acute
     cardiopulmonary abnormality.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      60 year old woman with cad, s/p MI. now febrile                                 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      r/o infiltrate

                                     FINAL REPORT
     COMPARISON:  [**2662-3-2**].
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status post MI.  Febrile.
     
     The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and there is marked upper zone vascular
     redistribution as well as widening of the azygos vein contour.  There has been
     development of numerous septal lines, as well as small bilateral pleural
     effusions.  There are no confluent areas of consolidation within either lung.
     
     Skeletal structures reveal diffuse demineralization.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Findings consistent with congestive heart failure with interstitial edema and
     small pleural effusions.  No evidence of pneumonia, but followup radiographs
     after diuresis may be helpful to exclude subtle underlying pneumonia.
