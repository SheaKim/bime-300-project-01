Admission Date:  [**2906-3-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2906-3-15**]

Date of Birth:   [**2824-1-25**]     Sex:  F

Service:  ICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  An 82-year-old female with hypotension.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was admitted on
[**2906-3-9**] with a complaint of chest pain that woke her
from [**Doctor Last Name 292**].

The patient went to dialysis where she experienced chest pain
again.  It was thought at this time that it might be
secondary to a pericarditis.  The patient also had an episode
of bradycardia while on dialysis and was noted to have a left
fistula clotted.

The patient was previously admitted with atrial fibrillation
and treated with diltiazem and propafenone.  The patient had
a CT angiogram which was negative for aortic dissection and
significant for a stable pericardial effusion.  The patient
also ruled out for a myocardial infarction with negative
creatine kinases and troponins.

The patient had thrombolysis of her fistula on [**3-10**].  The
patient was also evaluated by Endocrinology for a low
thyroid-stimulating hormone, low free T4, and low T3.  It was
thought at this time the patient was suffering from Secu
thyroid syndrome.

On [**2906-3-13**], dialysis was stopped for hypotension.  An
echocardiogram on [**3-15**] showed an ejection fraction of
greater than 55%, moderate-to-large pericardial effusion.  No
tamponade.  Medical Intensive Care Unit was called to
evaluate the patient with systolic blood pressure in the low
70s.  Blood pressure had been trending downward since
[**2906-3-12**]; and at baseline, the patient had a systolic
blood pressure range of greater than 130.

The patient currently denied abdominal pain or chest pain.
The patient did note some shortness of breath.  No nausea or
vomiting, and reportedly was lightheaded when attempting to
sit up.  The patient did not have any evidence of bleeding
from the gastrointestinal tract, and currently was not making
any urine.  The patient was started on vancomycin and
levofloxacin empirically and a bolus of 750 cc of normal
saline.  The patient was then admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 1600**]
Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  End-stage renal disease.
2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with an FEV1
of 0.55, FEV1:FVC ratio of 75% or predicted.
3.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Known pericardial effusion.
6.  Status post cholecystectomy.
7.  Atrial fibrillation.

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN and SULFA (which cause a rash).

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications in the hospital were
heparin subcutaneous, Zantac 150 mg intravenously q.d.,
Nephrocaps one tablet p.o. q.d., Sevelamer 2400 mg p.o.
t.i.d., aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d.,
salmeterol 1 to 2 puffs p.o. b.i.d., propafenone 150 mg p.o.
t.i.d., ipratropium 2 puffs q.i.d., APAP 325/150 mg p.o.
q.d., albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers as needed.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father with [**Name2 (NI) 2256**] cancer.  Family history of
renal disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her husband.  A 65-pack-year
history.  Occasional ethanol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Vital signs revealed
temperature was 97, heart rate was 87, blood pressure
was 74/palp, respiratory rate was 16, 95% on 1 liters.  In
general, the patient was a pleasant/elderly female in no
apparent distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
revealed mucous membranes were dry.  Neck revealed no jugular
venous distention appreciated.  Cardiovascular with an
irregularly irregular heart rate.  No murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Pulmonary revealed diffuse wheezes bilaterally at
the bases.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  Extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema.  Neurologically, alert and oriented times three.
Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Data revealed
white blood cell count was 13.3 (increased from 9.2),
hematocrit was 31.2, platelets were 364.  PT was 59.6.
Chemistry-7 was remarkable for creatinine of 4.3, blood urea
nitrogen was 28, sodium was 144, bicarbonate was 25.  Calcium
was 10.1, magnesium was 5.2, phosphate was 2.1.  Arterial
blood gas revealed 7.32/47/82, lactate of 1.4.  Blood
cultures were pending times two.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram revealed atrial
fibrillation at 91 beats per minute, left axis deviation.  No
ST-T wave changes.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  In summary, this was an 82-year-old
female with a history of end-stage renal disease, pericardial
effusion (without tamponade physiology), and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, who presented with
hypotension.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  It was thought at this time the etiology
was most likely multifactorial; however, given an increase in
white blood cell count, concern for sepsis was high, and the
patient was given empiric antibiotic coverage.  It was also
thought that the patient should have a repeat echocardiogram
to assess for tamponade; however, it was less likely that
tamponade was causing hypotension secondary to lack of
tamponade physiology.

The patient was maintained with aggressive fluid hydration
and multiple intravenous fluid boluses.  On the morning of
[**3-15**], the patient was found unresponsive, and there was a
question if initial neurologic examination showed a left
hemineglect.  A heparin drip had been started the day
previous for atrial fibrillation.  The patient was emergently
intubated and was minimally responsive.  The patient appeared
to be in a junctional rhythm at 60 beats per minute on
telemetry.  After dopamine and bicarbonate were given, the
patient reverted back to a normal sinus rhythm at 60 beats
per minute.  On examination, it was noted that the patient's
extremities were cold and clammy.

The patient had an arterial blood gas which showed worsening
acidemia with a pH of 7.2, PCO2 of 242, and PO2 of 415 on
100%, lactate had increased to 3.9.  The patient also had a
blood urea nitrogen of 36 and a creatinine which had
increased to 5.1.

It was thought at this time that the patient's heart rhythm
was most likely secondary to a major metabolic insult.  It
was still debated as to whether tamponade was contributing to
hypotension.  There was also concern that the patient was on
a heparin drip and demonstrated possible left hemineglect.
The heparin was discontinued, and the patient was scheduled
to have a CT scan of her head to rule out bleed.  However,
the patient was never hemodynamically stable enough to be
sent to the CT scanner.  The patient was continued on a
dopamine drip and propafenone was also continued at this
time.

On [**2906-3-15**] (at 9:45 p.m.), the patient became
bradycardic and hypotensive again.  She was noted to have a
blood pressure of 39/palp, and a heart rate of 45.  The
patient was given 1 mg of atropine, and 1 mg of epinephrine,
and intravenous fluids.  The patient's rhythm then changed to
asystolic cardiac arrest.

Chest compressions were initiated. The patient was given 2 mg
more of atropine and epinephrine and 1 ampule of bicarbonate.
The chest compressions continued, and rhythm changed to
coarse ventricular fibrillation.  The patient was shocked in
succession times three without rhythm.  Cardiopulmonary
resuscitation was then re-initiated.  Examination revealed
bilateral breath sounds.  The patient was given another
milligram of atropine.  Epinephrine, bicarbonate, dopamine,
and Levophed were wide opened; and intravenous fluids were
placed wide open.

The patient was thought to be hyperkalemic and given calcium
carbonate, D-50 saline; repeat potassium was 4.4.  The
patient returned from a normal sinus rhythm to ventricular
tachycardia for approximately 15 minutes, and blood pressure
increased.  Pressors were weaned.  An emergent Cardiology
consultation for a repeat echocardiogram was called.

The patient's rhythm changed again asystole, and pressors
were restarted, and atropine was given.  Emergent
pericardiocentesis with 50 cc to 60 cc of venous blood,
not clotted, returned without hemodynamic response.  The
patient remainder in asystole, and the patient was pronounced
dead at 9:25 p.m.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Expired.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  End-stage renal failure.
2.  Possible sepsis complicated by profound hypotension.
3.  Pericardial effusion.
4.  Lactic acidosis.
5.  Hyperkalemia.
6.  Atrial fibrillation.
7.  Asystolic cardiac arrest.
8.  Respiratory failure.
9.  Mental status changes.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  82 year old female status post left arm AV fistula placement two
     years ago. Patient's last dialysis was three days ago and was performed
     without difficulty. The patient now presents with no thrill and suspicion of
     clotted AV fistula.
     
     RADIOLOGIST: Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 262**] [**Name (STitle) 263**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **]'Othee and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 147**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 346**]. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 263**]
     [**Name (STitle) 264**], the staff radiologist, was present for the whole procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS: 35 ml of non-ionic contrast IV (Optiray 320 at 60%). No
     conscious sedation.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE: The procedure was described to the patient and informed
     consent was obtained. The fistula was initially palpated and no thrill was
     demonstrated. Duplex and color flow sonography was then used to further assess
     the AV fistula, and it was demonstrated that there was extensive hypoechoic
     material, which was noncompressible, throughout the proximal anastomosis to
     the upper third of the arm. At the level of the proximal humerus, the draining
     vein was anechoic and easily compressible. A 18-gauge angiocath was then used
     to access the vein at this level under sonographic guidance. Sequential left
     upper extremity and central venograms were then performed. Following this, a
     tourniquet was applied over the left upper arm to reflux contrast material
     back into the proximal draining vein and possibly arterial system. The
     Angiocath was then removed and compression was applied over the left arm
     puncture site until hemostasis was achieved.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: None.
     
     FINDINGS: At the needle entry site of the draining vein (cephalic vein), the
     flow is normal without evidence for filling defects or stenoses. The cephalic
     vein is large in appearance and empties into the axillary/subclavian vein.
     There is free flow of contrast material from the subclavian vein into the SVC.
     Reflux of contrast material is demonstrated in the brachial-axillary venous
     junction.
     
     With a tourniquet then applied over the upper left extremity, contrast
     material was refluxed back towards the venous anastomosis. Extensive filling
     defect was then demonstrated involving a segment of 5 cm in length consistent
     with thrombus material. Tiny collateral veins are visualized along the vein at
                                                                 (Over)

     HISTORY: Chest pain radiating to the back. Assess for aortic dissection.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helically aquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     thoracic inlet to the aortic bifurcation without and with IV contrast.
     Nonionic IV contrast was administered secondary to the rapid rate of bolus
     injection required for this study.
     
     COMPARISON: CT chest [**2906-3-3**].
     
     CT CHEST W/O&W IV CONTRAST: There is diffuse calcification of the thoracic
     aorta, but no evidence of dissection or aneurysmal dilatation.  The main
     pulmonary arteries are also well opacified, without evidence of intraarterial
     filling defects.  There is a persistent large pericardial effusion.  There are
     no pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymph nodes.  There
     are tiny bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.  Lung windows
     again show multiple blebs within both lungs.  There are no focal
     consolidations or pneumothoraces.
     
     CT ABDOMEN W/O&W IV CONTRAST: No dissection or aneurysmal dilatation is seen
     within the abdominal aorta.  The liver, spleen, pancreas and adrenal glands
     are unremarkable.  The kidneys are bilaterally atrophic.  There are multiple
     prominent mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, none of which meet CT
     criteria for pathologic enlargement.  There is no free air or free fluid
     within the abdomen.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate no lytic or blastic lesions.
     
     Multiplanar reconstruction images confirm the above findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) No evidence of aortic dissection.
     2) Diffuse emphysema.
     3) Large pericardial effusion, unchanged since [**2906-3-3**].

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: Chest pain radiating to the back. Assess for aortic dissection.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helically aquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     thoracic inlet to the aortic bifurcation without and with IV contrast.
     Nonionic IV contrast was administered secondary to the rapid rate of bolus
     injection required for this study.
     
     COMPARISON: CT chest [**2906-3-3**].
     
     CT CHEST W/O&W IV CONTRAST: There is diffuse calcification of the thoracic
     aorta, but no evidence of dissection or aneurysmal dilatation.  The main
     pulmonary arteries are also well opacified, without evidence of intraarterial
     filling defects.  There is a persistent large pericardial effusion.  There are
     no pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymph nodes.  There
     are tiny bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.  Lung windows
     again show multiple blebs within both lungs.  There are no focal
     consolidations or pneumothoraces.
     
     CT ABDOMEN W/O&W IV CONTRAST: No dissection or aneurysmal dilatation is seen
     within the abdominal aorta.  The liver, spleen, pancreas and adrenal glands
     are unremarkable.  The kidneys are bilaterally atrophic.  There are multiple
     prominent mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, none of which meet CT
     criteria for pathologic enlargement.  There is no free air or free fluid
     within the abdomen.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate no lytic or blastic lesions.
     
     Multiplanar reconstruction images confirm the above findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) No evidence of aortic dissection.
     2) Diffuse emphysema.
     3) Large pericardial effusion, unchanged since [**2906-3-3**].

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      s/p L arm AVF placement 2 yrs ago, on HD, now with clotted AVF
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  82 year old female status post left arm AV fistula placement two
     years ago. Patient's last dialysis was three days ago and was performed
     without difficulty. The patient now presents with no thrill and suspicion of
     clotted AV fistula.
     
     RADIOLOGIST: Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 262**] [**Name (STitle) 263**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **]'Othee and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 147**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 346**]. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 263**]
     [**Name (STitle) 264**], the staff radiologist, was present for the whole procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS: 35 ml of non-ionic contrast IV (Optiray 320 at 60%). No
     conscious sedation.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE: The procedure was described to the patient and informed
     consent was obtained. The fistula was initially palpated and no thrill was
     demonstrated. Duplex and color flow sonography was then used to further assess
     the AV fistula, and it was demonstrated that there was extensive hypoechoic
     material, which was noncompressible, throughout the proximal anastomosis to
     the upper third of the arm. At the level of the proximal humerus, the draining
     vein was anechoic and easily compressible. A 18-gauge angiocath was then used
     to access the vein at this level under sonographic guidance. Sequential left
     upper extremity and central venograms were then performed. Following this, a
     tourniquet was applied over the left upper arm to reflux contrast material
     back into the proximal draining vein and possibly arterial system. The
     Angiocath was then removed and compression was applied over the left arm
     puncture site until hemostasis was achieved.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: None.
     
     FINDINGS: At the needle entry site of the draining vein (cephalic vein), the
     flow is normal without evidence for filling defects or stenoses. The cephalic
     vein is large in appearance and empties into the axillary/subclavian vein.
     There is free flow of contrast material from the subclavian vein into the SVC.
     Reflux of contrast material is demonstrated in the brachial-axillary venous
     junction.
     
     With a tourniquet then applied over the upper left extremity, contrast
     material was refluxed back towards the venous anastomosis. Extensive filling
     defect was then demonstrated involving a segment of 5 cm in length consistent
     with thrombus material. Tiny collateral veins are visualized along the vein at
                                                                 (Over)

     the level of the distal humerus, that anastomosed with the cephalic and
     brachial veins more proximally. Reflux of contrast material into the arterial
     system was not demonstrated due to the extensive thrombus in the draining
     vein.
     
     IMPRESSION: No evidence for central stenoses or filling defects. Extensive
     thrombus material is demonstrated throughout the proximal vein anastomosis.
     The patient will return to the Interventional Radiology Suite on [**2906-3-10**], and
     declotting/thrombolysis will be performed at that time.

     INDICATION:  Three hours post TPA follow-up.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 23**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 346**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23**], staff radiologist,
     was present throughout the procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS: 85 ml of Optiray 320 at 60%; .5 mg Versed and 25
     micrograms fentanyl in divided doses under continued hemodynamic monitoring.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was described to the patient and
     informed consent was obtained.  A venogram obtained through the midportion of
     the draining vein documents significantly improved flow, with no residual
     thrombus in this region.  There was, however, no thrill palpated at this
     point.
     
     For this reason, we accessed the draining vein at the level of the
     proximal/mid-humerus, with an 18 gauge angio cath pointed toward the hand. The
     angio catheter was exchanged over a wire for a 4 French sheath.  1000 units of
     heparin were then given intravenously.  An angled glidewire was then advanced
     through the sheath, and manipulated into the arterial system.  This was
     followed by placement of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 349**] balloon catheter, which was inflated and
     pulled back from the arterial plug at the anastomosis.  Following removal of
     the [**Doctor Last Name 349**] catheter, a 6 mm balloon was advanced in the previously placed 4
     French catheter pointing toward the heart, inflated, and the balloon was
     advanced centrally.  A 4 French Cobra 2 glide cath was then advanced in the
     sheath pointing toward the hand, over the wire and into the arterial tree.  At
     this time, reflux into the brachial artery was demonstrated, and real-time of
     the contrast in the artery suggested reduced cardiac output.
     
     With residual thrombus in the proximal draining vein and at the anastomosis, a
     10 cm infusion catheter was subsequently placed, with the radiopaque marker
     placed in the area of presumed thrombus and just beyond the arterial
     anastomosis. 1 mg of TPA was then pulse-sprayed through the infusion catheter
     five times, for a total of 5mg. TPA will be infused overnight at a rate of 0.5
     mg/hour, with close monitoring of the PT/PTT/INR and fibrinogen levels. 100
     units of heparin will be infused through both the 4 French side arm sheathes
     for patency.

     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was described to the patient and
     informed consent was obtained.  A venogram obtained through the midportion of
     the draining vein documents significantly improved flow, with no residual

     micrograms fentanyl in divided doses under continued hemodynamic monitoring.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was described to the patient and
     informed consent was obtained.  A venogram obtained through the midportion of
     the draining vein documents significantly improved flow, with no residual
     thrombus in this region.  There was, however, no thrill palpated at this
     point.
     
     For this reason, we accessed the draining vein at the level of the
     proximal/mid-humerus, with an 18 gauge angio cath pointed toward the hand. The
     angio catheter was exchanged over a wire for a 4 French sheath.  1000 units of
     heparin were then given intravenously.  An angled glidewire was then advanced
     through the sheath, and manipulated into the arterial system.  This was
     followed by placement of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 349**] balloon catheter, which was inflated and
     pulled back from the arterial plug at the anastomosis.  Following removal of
     the [**Doctor Last Name 349**] catheter, a 6 mm balloon was advanced in the previously placed 4
     French catheter pointing toward the heart, inflated, and the balloon was
     advanced centrally.  A 4 French Cobra 2 glide cath was then advanced in the
     sheath pointing toward the hand, over the wire and into the arterial tree.  At
     this time, reflux into the brachial artery was demonstrated, and real-time of
     the contrast in the artery suggested reduced cardiac output.
     
     With residual thrombus in the proximal draining vein and at the anastomosis, a
     10 cm infusion catheter was subsequently placed, with the radiopaque marker
     placed in the area of presumed thrombus and just beyond the arterial
     anastomosis. 1 mg of TPA was then pulse-sprayed through the infusion catheter
     five times, for a total of 5mg. TPA will be infused overnight at a rate of 0.5
     mg/hour, with close monitoring of the PT/PTT/INR and fibrinogen levels. 100
     units of heparin will be infused through both the 4 French side arm sheathes
     for patency.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.

     INDICATION:  Status post 20 hour TPA infusion.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 23**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 346**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23**], staff radiologist,
     was present throughout the procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:  85 ml of Optiray 320 at 60%; .5 Versed and 25
     micrograms fentanyl in divided doses under continued hemodynamic monitoring
     for conscious sedation.
     
     NOTE:  Images obtained from this study were combined with the study from
     [**2906-3-10**] in which there are 36 images on the PACS system.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was described to the patient and
     informed consent was obtained.  Palpation of the fistula now demonstrates a
     thrill at the anastomosis and into the draining vein.  An initial venogram
     obtained through the infusion catheter demonstrates wide patency of the AV
     fistula, with some eccentric filling defect at the region of the anastomosis.
     There is also a focal mild stenosis of the draining vein present, just distal
     of which there is a hypertrophied vein draining laterally.
     
     Venograms obtained over the proximal humerus and centrally show no filling
     defect in the draining cephalic vein, the subclavian or brachiocephalic vein.
     The catheter was then exchanged over a wire, with the wire placed in a forearm
     artery.  Injection through the sheath pointed toward the hand was then
     performed, initially without and then following blood pressure cuff inflation.
     These images document patency at the arterial anastomosis, without stenosis
     present.  A focal stenosis is seen approximately 5-6 cm distal to the
     anastomosis.  This area was subsequently angioplastied using a 6 mm x 3 cm
     balloon.  Even at maximum inflation, no waist was visualized on the balloon,
     confirming a nonhemodynamically significant stenosis.
     
     Both sheathes were then removed in the recovery room, and compression was
     applied until hemostasis achieved.  Subsequently, the patient had hemodialysis
     through her fistula later in the day without difficulty.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful declotting of a left AV fistula following 20 hour
     infusion of tissue plasminogen activator.  Satisfactory angiographic and
     clinical result.

     artery.  Injection through the sheath pointed toward the hand was then
     performed, initially without and then following blood pressure cuff inflation.
     These images document patency at the arterial anastomosis, without stenosis
     present.  A focal stenosis is seen approximately 5-6 cm distal to the
     anastomosis.  This area was subsequently angioplastied using a 6 mm x 3 cm
     balloon.  Even at maximum inflation, no waist was visualized on the balloon,
     confirming a nonhemodynamically significant stenosis.
     
     Both sheathes were then removed in the recovery room, and compression was
     applied until hemostasis achieved.  Subsequently, the patient had hemodialysis
     through her fistula later in the day without difficulty.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.

     INDICATION:  Status post 20 hour TPA infusion.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 23**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 346**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23**], staff radiologist,
     was present throughout the procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:  85 ml of Optiray 320 at 60%; .5 Versed and 25
     micrograms fentanyl in divided doses under continued hemodynamic monitoring
     for conscious sedation.
     
     NOTE:  Images obtained from this study were combined with the study from
     [**2906-3-10**] in which there are 36 images on the PACS system.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was described to the patient and
     informed consent was obtained.  Palpation of the fistula now demonstrates a
     thrill at the anastomosis and into the draining vein.  An initial venogram
     obtained through the infusion catheter demonstrates wide patency of the AV
     fistula, with some eccentric filling defect at the region of the anastomosis.
     There is also a focal mild stenosis of the draining vein present, just distal
     of which there is a hypertrophied vein draining laterally.
     
     Venograms obtained over the proximal humerus and centrally show no filling
     defect in the draining cephalic vein, the subclavian or brachiocephalic vein.
     The catheter was then exchanged over a wire, with the wire placed in a forearm
     artery.  Injection through the sheath pointed toward the hand was then
