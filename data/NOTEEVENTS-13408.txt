     Reason: R/O PE
      Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 150
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      60 year old woman w decreased sats, tachycardia.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      R/O PE
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  Decreased oxygen saturation, rule out pulmonary embolism.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the chest were obtained after the administration
     of 150 cc of Optiray per fast bolus technique.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is no evidence of filling defects
     within the main pulmonary artery and its branches.  There is no evidence of
     enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes.  The heart is normal in size, there
     is no pericardial fluid.  There are moderate sized bilateral pleural
     effusions.  Also noted are bibasilar dependent atelectasis.  Lung windows
     demonstrate bilateral patchy perihilar opacities.  The airway is patent.  The
     bones demonstrate multiple sclerotic foci not significantly changed compared
     to prior exam.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
     2.  Moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions.
     3.  Patchy perihilar opacities which are likely related to fluid overload, an
     infectious component cannot be entirely excluded.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      60 year old woman with breast CA
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      s/p L4-S1 fixation for malig Fx, known metastatic breast CA, now with acute
      drop in Hct...suspect retroperitoneal bleed.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Status post fixation of the lower lumbar spine for breast cancer.
     Acute drop in hematocrit, rule out retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained without IV
     contrast.
     
     Comparison with prior CT from [**3044-5-30**] and chest CT from [**3044-11-25**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Again seen are moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions with
     bibasilar areas of consolidation.  The size is essentially unchanged compared
     to [**3044-11-25**].  Again seen are bilateral perihilar patchy opacities which are
     stable compared to prior exam.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The
     heart is normal in size, there is no evidence of pericardial fluid.  There is
     a Swan-Ganz catheter and an NG tube.  The liver appears normal in size, there
     are no focal lesions.  The gallbladder is partially distended and contains
     sludge.  The pancreas is atrophic.  The spleen, both adrenals and both kidneys
     are normal.  Loops of small bowel are not dilated.  There is no evidence of
     inflammatory changes in the mesenteric fat.  The aorta is heavily calcified.
     There is no evidence of enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes.  There is no
     intraabdominal free fluid.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is a Foley catheter within the
     bladder.  There is contrast material probably from IV contrast administered 24
     hours earlier.  The uterus is present and there are calcified fibroids.  There
     is no evidence of pelvic fluid.
     
     There are post-surgical changes in the lower lumbar and upper sacral spine, as
     well as destructive changes of the vertebral bodies.  Other foci of sclerosis
     are seen in the upper lumbar spine.
     
     There is extensive subcutaneous edema.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) No evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
     
     2) Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar areas of
     consolidation.

     Frontal and right-side-down decubitus films, two views:  Comparison
     [**3044-11-30**].  There is a left central line with tip in the inferior SVC/right
     atrium.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are bilateral diffuse interstitial
     and alveolar infiltrates, likely representing edema.  Left lower lobe density
     seen on prior study clears on the decubitus view, and is likely related to
     layering pleural effusion.  There is also a layering effusion on the right.
     There are no definite focal areas of pneumonic consolidation.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of interstitial and alveolar edema with
     bilateral layering pleural effusions.
