     INDICATION:  History of bladder cancer.  Question metastases.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Prior study of in [**3476-5-24**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired axial images of the abdomen were acquired without
     intravenous contrast, followed by images of the chest and abdomen with
     intravenous contrast material.  Additional three minute delay images of the
     abdomen and pelvis were acquired and displayed with 5 mm slice thickness.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST:  There is a 12 x 10 mm hypoattenuating lesion in the left
     lobe of the thyroid gland, further evaluation with ultrasound is recommended
     if clinically indicated.  There is no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar
     lymphadenopathy.  There are dependent changes in the lung bases.  There are no
     pleural effusions.  The heart and great vessels appear unremarkable.  The
     airways are open to the segmental bronchi bilaterally.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  The patient is status post cholecystectomy.  The liver is
     unremarkable.  There is hydronephrosis with delayed nephrogram on the right.
     There is a prominent ureter on the left without evidence of
     hydronephrosis.  The spleen, adrenal glands, pancreas, stomach, and opacified
     loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable.  There is no mesenteric or
     retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  There is no free fluid in the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS:  There is an enhancing soft tissue mass in the right aspect
     of the bladder. The distal ureter is dilated on the right. There is no
     contrast extravasation.  There are shotty lymph nodes in the pelvis without
     evidence of pathological enlargement.  There is a minimal amount of free
     fluid.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There is an 8 mm lytic lesion in the vertebral body of T11 on
     the right near the pedicle, which is concerning for a metastatic focus.  Bone
     scan may be helpful for further evaluation if clinically indicated.  There are
     moderate-to-severe degenerative changes at the facet joints of the lower

     HISTORY: BLADDER CA, ? METS   
       
     INTERPRETATION:  Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and
     posterior projections and demonstrate apparent dilatation of the right 
     collecting system with abnormal bladder contour.  Tracer is present outside the
     body representing urinary output. No increased tracer activity is noted at T12. 
     There is persistent activity near the L4/5 level consistent with degenerative
     change.  
       
     When compared to the previous study of [**3473-11-19**] the dilated collecting system
     is new as well as the abnormal bladder contour.  
       
     The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer
     excretion.  
       
     IMPRESSION:   1) No abnormal tracer activity at T12  2) Increased activity at
     the L4-5 level is likely degenerative and unchanged compared to [**3473-11-19**]  3)
     Right hydro-ureteronephrosis and abnormal bladder contour that correlates with
     the findings of the CT scan of [**3477-1-18**].

Chief Complaint:
Bladder cancer
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**3477-1-30**] Radical cystoprostatectomy with ileal loop urostomy.

 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8937**] is a 77-year-old male with a long history of 
high-grade T1 transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, 
initially diagnosed seven years ago and treated with multiple 
courses of BCG and interferon. He has also had 
multiple TURPs as well as a partial cystectomy to control his 
tumor. Most recently in [**8-/3476**], he underwent TURP. Pathology 
from which revealed high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ of 
random bladder biopsies and of the bladder tumor. He was found 
to have high-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma with adjacent 
high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ. No definitive invasion 
of the lamina propria was seen. The muscularis propria was 
present and uninvolved by tumor. A biopsy done in [**4-/3476**], 
however, did show high-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma with 
invasion of the lamina propria as well as superficial invasion 
of the smooth muscle. Given this history, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8937**] has 
undergone treatments with intravesical mitomycin and he now 
presents for surgical management.
 
Past Medical History:
Gout, diabetes, and Parkinson's
 
Social History:
He is a nonsmoker. He did smoke cigar, quit 20 
years ago. He drinks alcohol occasionally. He is married with 
three healthy children, used to work as a lawyer and lives in 
[**Location **]. 

 
Family History:
 Father with renal cell carcinoma and a son with 
renal cell carcinoma.

Seven lymph[**MD Number 285**] with no evidence of malignancy.
5. Left pelvic lymph[**MD Number 285**] (CA-HA):
Ten lymph[**MD Number 285**] with no evidence of malignancy.

Urinary Bladder: Cystectomy, partial, total or radical; anterior 
exenteration Synopsis
MACROSCOPIC
Specimen Type:  Radical cystoprostatectomy.
Tumor Site:  Left lateral wall.
Tumor Size
    Greatest dimension:  4 cm.  Additional dimensions:  4 cm x 
2.3 cm.
MICROSCOPIC
Histologic Type:  Urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma with 
squamous differentiation.
Associated epithelial lesions:  Urothelial (transitional cell) 
carcinoma in situ (flat carcinoma in situ).
Histologic Grade
Urothelial carcinoma (WHO/ISUP, 1998):  High-grade.
Tumor configuration:  Solid/nodule.
EXTENT OF INVASION
Primary Tumor:  pT2b:  Tumor invades deep muscle.
Regional Lymph[**MD Number **]:  pN0:  No regional lymph node metastasis.
Lymph[**MD Number **]
    Number examined:  17.
    Number involved:  0.
Distant metastasis:  pMX:  Cannot be assessed.
Margins:  
        Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma.
Venous (Large vessel) invasion:  Present.
Additional Pathologic Findings:  Therapy-related changes; 
granulomatous inflammation.
Comments:  Perineural invasion present. Tumor involves the deep 
muscularis propria and focally involves fat. The fat appears to 
be adjacent to and between muscle bundles of the muscularis 
propria. There is no definitive evidence of tumor extension into 
perivascular fat.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on the day of surgery.  He underwent a 
radical cystoprostatectomy with ileal loop urostomy.  He 
tolerated the procedure well without complications.  He remained 
intubated overnight and was observed in the SICU until POD2 for 
close monitoring.  His post-op course was largely uneventful and 
he recovered well.  His pain was well controlled and he required 
no narcotics following his transfer out of the SICU.  His diet 
was advanced as tolerated beginning after the patient passed 
flatus and his NGT was removed.  He was out of bed and 
ambulating with physical therapy.  PT recommended home with home 
physical therapy for further conditioning.  He was evaluated by 
the stoma care nursing and began to undergo teaching along with 
his wife for stoma care.  He was given peri-op coumadin for DVT 
prophylaxis and was noted to have an INR of 4.0 on POD5.  He had 
no bleeding complications and his INR was 2.5 at the time of 
discharge without intervention.  He was discharged to home with 
VNA services and home physical therapy on POD 6.

     HISTORY:  Followup of mediastinal widening on prior study.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3477-1-30**], at 5:53 p.m.
     
     AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The previously seen widened mediastinum is not
     appreciated on the present study and was likely due to technical factors
     (rotation).  There is an NG tube whose tip is in the stomach.  The
     endotracheal tube tip is approximately 5 cm from the carina.  There is a right
     IJ line whose tip is in the distal SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.
     
     There is a patchy opacity seen in the right upper lobe which is new compared
     to approximately four hours prior.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Previously seen mediastinal widening likely due to technical factors.
     2.  Interval development of right upper lobe opacity, developing pneumonia Vs.
     aspiration are considerations.

     COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made to [**3476-6-6**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  AP supine single view of the chest.
     
     FINDINGS:  The study is limited due to rotation of the patient's (LAO)
     position.
     
     The ET tube is in good position.  There is a right IJ central line with the
     tip in the cavoatrial junction.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal without
     evidence of CHF.  The lung fields are probably clear, but there is limited
     visualization of the right upper lobe. There is elevation of the right
     hemidiaphragm.
     
     Widening of the mediastinum could be partially secondary to postioning.
     However,  Recommend repeat radiograph to exclude a hematoma.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. ET tube is in good position.

     CHEST PA AND LATERAL
     
     HISTORY:  Cough, status post cystectomy.
     
     PA and lateral views of the chest are submitted and compared to the patient's
     prior PA and lateral views from [**3476-6-6**] as well as postoperative films
     from [**3477-1-31**].  Small bilateral pleural effusions are present which
     are new.  The cardiac silhouette, however, and central pulmonary vasculature
     appear unchanged compared to the patient's preoperative studies and no edema
     or focal parenchymal consolidation to suggest pneumonia is seen.  The flowing
     osteophytes of DISH are evident in the thoracic spine anteriorly.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     1.  New small bilateral pleural effusions without evidence of current CHF or
     edema.
     2.  No pneumonia.
     3.  DISH.

     FINDINGS:  There are five non-rib-bearing lumbar-type vertebral bodies.  There
     is some slight scoliosis of lumbar spine with convexity to the left side,
     which is centered at L2/L3.  Multiple surgical clips are seen in the pelvis.
     On the lateral radiograph, there is extensive osteophytosis.  There is also
     marked facet joint arthropathy noted in the lower lumbar spine.  The vertebral
     body heights are preserved with normal alignment.  The intervertebral disc
     spaces are also relatively preserved.  Aortic calcifications are seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Degenerative changes of the posterior elements of the lower lumbar spine.
     There are no compression deformities or abnormal antero or retrolisthesis of

     COMPARISONS:  [**3477-1-18**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Oncology CT torso protocol was used.  Axial MDCT images were
     obtained through the abdomen before and after administration of nonionic
     Optiray contrast.  Post-contrast images were also obtained though the chest
     and pelvis.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is an 8 mm, noncalcified pulmonary
     nodule within the right lower lobe (3a:31), which was not present on the
     previous exam.  A 3 mm noncalcified pulmonary nodule within the left upper
     lobe (3a:15) is stable.  There is also a new, pathologically enlarged 1.2 cm
     left-sided pericardial node which is new.  There are no pleural effusions.
     There are dense coronary artery calcifications.  The airways are patent down
     to the segmental bronchi.  There is 1.8 cm low attenuation opacity within the
     region of the minor fissure on the right, which likely represents fluid
     loculated within the fissure rather than a pulmonary nodule.  There are small
     paratracheal lymph nodes, which do not meet pathologic criteria.  The thyroid
     gland is nodular and heterogeneous.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The patient is status post
     cholecystectomy.  Otherwise, the liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and
     adrenal glands are unremarkable.  The kidneys are unremarkable bilaterally
     without evidence of hydronephrosis, masses, or stones.  There are
     atherosclerotic calcifications within the aorta.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Patient is status post cystectomy with
     ileal diversion and surgical clips identified.  There is no evidence of
     obstruction, stones or abnormal masses.  There are tiny inguinal nodes
     bilaterally with no pathologic lymphadenopathy identified within the pelvis.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
     Degenerative change is seen within the lower thoracic and lumbar spine.

     [**Doctor Last Name 14877**] in lung masses.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial CT images of the chest were obtained with and
     without the administration of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 322**], 90 cc of Optiray.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT torso study dated [**3477-6-1**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Again note is made of somewhat ill-defined right hilar nodule
     measuring 2.5 x 2.0 cm, increased in size compared to the prior study,
     worrisome for increasing metastasis.  The mass abuts the bifurcation of right
     middle bronchus.  There is 2.3-cm nodule abutting the pericardium anterior to
     the left hilum, increased in size compared to the prior study, most likely
     representing increasing metastatic lymphadenopathy.  Coronary arteries are
     calcified.  There is bilateral pleural effusion, larger on the left,
     associated with atelectasis, new compared to the prior study.  There is no
     significant pericardial effusion.  Coronary arteries are calcified.  In the
     lung window, there is peripheral opacity in right lower lobe, likely
     representing small foci of atelectasis.  Tiny left apical nodule measuring 8
     mm is again noted.  Previously noted right lower lobe nodule is not
     confidently identified on this study.
     
     In the visualized portion of the upper abdomen, no gross abnormalities are
     noted, however, the evaluation is somewhat limited due to motion artifact. The
     patient is status post cholecystectomy.
     
     There is no suspicious lytic or blastic lesion in skeletal structures.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Increase in size of right hilar nodule measuring 2.8 cm, with increase in
     size of 2.3-cm nodule anterior to the left hilum, worrisome for increasing
     metastasis.
     
     2.  7-mm nodule in the left apex.  Previously noted right lower lobe nodule is
     not confidently identified on this study.
     
     3.  New bilateral pleural effusion with left lower lobe atelectasis.  Small
     peripheral opacity in right lower lobe, most likely representing atelectasis.

     RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA:
        27.5 mCi Tc-99m MDP;
     HISTORY: 78 year old man with history of transitional cell carcinoma and  
     parkinson's disease, presenting with occult infection and CT suggestive of
     metastatic disease. Evaluate for osteomyelitis or osseous metastases.  
       
     INTERPRETATION:    
       
     Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and posterior
     projections.  Static images of lateral views of the lower extremities were also
     obtained.  
       
     There is mildly increased tracer uptake along the cortices of both femurs and
     tibias, and a single focus of increased uptake at the right mid fibular
     diaphysis. The appearance is most consistent with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy.
     The pelvis is not well evaluated due to the overlying urine collection bag at
     the ileal conduit ostomy. In the remainder of the skeleton, there is no evidence
     of osteomyelitis or osseous metastatic disease on the current examination.  
       
     The kidneys and external bag draining the ileal conduit are visualized, the
     normal route of tracer excretion.  
       
     IMPRESSION:  1. Findings most consistent with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy of
     the lower extremities.  2. Limited evaluation of the pelvis as described.
     Otherwise, no evidence of osteomyelitis or osseous metastatic disease.

     INDICATIONS:  78-year-old man with new metastatic disease of unknown primary,
     with a change in mental status.
     
     COMPARISONS:  CT, [**6-5**] and MR, [**3476-6-7**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: Head CT with and without intravenous contrast.
     
     FINDINGS: There is widening of the extra-axial spaces, particularly bifrontal,
     with enlargement of the sulci and ventricles consistent with atrophic change.
     Pineal and choroid plexus calcifications in the lateral ventricles are
     unchanged.  There is no evidence of intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage.  The
     [**Doctor Last Name 8**]-white matter differentiation is preserved.  There is no mass effect,
     hydrocephalus, or shift of the normally midline structures.  With
     administration of intravenous contrast, no areas of abnormal enhancement are
     demonstrated.  Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
     The osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of metastatic disease or acute intracranial process.
     If clinically indicated, MR [**First Name (Titles) 1191**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] is more sensitive for exclusion of
     intracranial metastasis.

     The right juxtahilar lung mass is unchanged during this short time interval.
     There is a new opacity just below the minor fissure in the subpleural location
     and  could be of  either pulmonary or pleural origin. The previously
     demonstrated left lower lobe atelectasis is largely cleared with small discoid
     atelectasis and tiny pleural effusion remaining.  There are no other pulmonary
     infiltrates or masses.  The heart size is stable.  The mediastinal contour and
     width are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  New right lower lung opacity which could represent either pleural
     effusion or pulmonary infiltrate such as pneumonia or infarct.  Further
     evaluation with PA and lateral chest radiographs is recommended.  These
     findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5665**].

     INDICATION:  78-year-old gentleman with history of dementia presenting with
     altered mental status, referred for video oropharyngeal swallow evaluation.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Video oropharyngeal swallow evaluation in conjunction with speech
     therapy in the presence of radiology.
     
     FINDINGS:  Patient was given multiple consistencies of barium to swallow in
     the presence of speech therapy and radiology.  Patient's swallowing was
     assessed using fluoroscopy.  On oral phase patient demonstrated a mildly
     impaired oral phase with difficulty with bolus formation and bolus control.
     Patient had mild amount of oral cavity residue and premature spillover into
     the valleculae with nectar-thick liquids.  On pharyngeal phase patient
     displayed moderately impaired laryngeal elevation and laryngeal valve closure.
     Patient had moderate amount of residue remaining in the valleculae after all
     consistencies of barium.  Multiple swallows were minimally effective at
     clearing the residue in the valleculae.  The patient demonstrated mild
     penetration with thin liquids during the swallow caused by the poor valve
     closure.  No aspiration was seen during exam.  Cued cough and reflexive cough
     were minimally effective at clearing the penetrated material.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Patient with mild-to-moderate oral cavity residue with premature spillover
     into the valleculae.  Furthermore on pharyngeal phase patient with moderate
     amount of residue remaining in the valleculae after all consistencies of
     barium which on multiple swallows were mildly effective at clearing the
     residue in the valleculae.  Patient demonstrates mild penetration with sips of
     nectar though no aspiration was seen on exam.
     
     2.  For further details please refer to detailed swallow evaluation available
     on computerized medical records.

     COMPARISON:  [**3477-6-30**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast axial CT.
     
     CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is very small amount of residual air in the
     pleural space at the apex as well as at the right base.  There is subcutaneous
     emphysema (a pleural tube was placed [**3477-7-28**], and has subsequently been
     removed).  Small bibasilar pleural effusions are unchanged.  Left lower lobe
     atelectasis, moderate in size, is unchanged.  There has been some enlargement
     of the right hilar mass that today measures 4.0 x 3.4 cm (previously 2.8 cm).
     Right hilar adjacent adenopathy has also increased slightly in the interval as
     well as a pretracheal node now measuring 2.9 cm.  Smaller mediastinal nodes
     have also slightly increased in the interval.
     
     Lung windows demonstrate new nodular 8-9mm soft tissue densities in the right
     upper and middle lobes. Central lucencies of these areas raises the
     possibility of early cavitation, though is nonspecific. Associated
     consolidation in the right middle lobe adjacent to the right hilar mass is new
     from July. Left lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged.
     
     The visualized portions of the abdomen are unchanged with gas-distended large
     bowel.  The patient is status post cholecystectomy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lesions identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Enlargement of right hilar mass and mediastinal adenopathy.
     2.  New 8 and 9 mm nodular opacities in the right upper and middle lobes.
     Differential includes small foci of infection versus spread of disease.
     3.  New right middle lobe consolidation associated with the enlarging right
     hilar mass.
