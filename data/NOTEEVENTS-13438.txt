Admission Date:  [**2849-5-11**]     Discharge Date:  [**2849-5-30**]

Date of Birth:   [**2802-12-7**]     Sex:  F

Service:  MICU

ADDENDUM:  In discussion with Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9094**] family on [**2849-5-30**]; the decision was made to change the goals of care
to insure the patient's comfort.  As her prognosis was grave
secondary to fulminant hepatic failure, further aggressive
treatments were no longer pursued and withdrawn.

The patient was placed on a morphine drip and remained
sedated with a propofol drip on mechanical ventilatory
support.  The patient remained comfortable with her family;
including her daughter ([**Name (NI) **]) and her father ([**Name (NI) **]) at
the bedside.

At approximately 11:25 p.m., I was called to see the patient
secondary to unresponsiveness.  The patient was pronounced
dead at 11:25 p.m. on [**2849-5-30**].

CAUSE OF DEATH:  Fulminant hepatic failure secondary to acute
hepatitis B.

     INDICATION:  Patient is s/p liver transplant with elevated transaminases.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images of the abdomen and
     pelvis with and without iv contrast using a hepatic CTA protocol.
     
     CONTRAST:  200 cc Optiray IV due to fast bolus.
     
     CT ABDOMEN W&W/0 CONTRAST:  There is a mild amount of ascites.  There is
     minimal hypodensity surrounding the portal vein, consistent with periportal
     edema, likely related to previous surgery.  Surgical clips are seen in the
     right lobe of the liver centrally.  The spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands and
     kidneys are unremarkable.  During the arterial phase of imaging, there is
     patchy and somewhat heterogeneously peripheral enhancement in the left lobe as
     compared to the right lobe of the liver. Portal venous and delayed imaging
     demonstrates more normal enhancement pattern.  There is no evidence of
     infarction.  There is mild enhancement of the common bile duct, again, likely
     related to surgical procedure.  No enhancing liver lesions are identified.
     
     CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST:  There is pelvic fluid.  The bladder and distal ureters
     are unremarkable.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic bone lesions.  Mild
     degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.
     
     There is minimal atelectasis at the right lung base.
     
     LIVER CTA:  FINDINGS:  The celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery, and
     renal arteries are widely patent.  There is an aberrant right hepatic artery.
     The main hepatic artery is widely patent and the right and left tributaries of
     the hepatic artery are visualized and widely patent.  The portal vein and
     hepatic veins are widely patent.

     A .018 wire is advanced into the SVC.  A Peel away sheath is exchanged for the
     needle.  It is determined that the distance between the puncture site and
     distal SVC is 45 cm.  A PICC line is trimed to the appropriate length and it
     is advanced over the wire. The peel away sheath is removed.  The distal
     position of the PICC line is confirmed with a single fluoroscopic film.  The
     line is demonstrated to withdraw in a flush. The PICC line is STAT-locked. The
     patient tolerated the procedure without complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:   Successful placement of a 45 cm single lumen PICC line from left
     basilic vein to distal SVC.  The line is ready for use.

      46 year old woman with N/V, abdominal pain, found to have a tramsaminitis, 
      hyperbilirubinemia.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      CT angiogram of the abdomen-? intrahepatic flow- poor visualization by 
      Ultrasound
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     INDICATION:  Patient is s/p liver transplant with elevated transaminases.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images of the abdomen and
     pelvis with and without iv contrast using a hepatic CTA protocol.
     
     CONTRAST:  200 cc Optiray IV due to fast bolus.
     
     CT ABDOMEN W&W/0 CONTRAST:  There is a mild amount of ascites.  There is
     minimal hypodensity surrounding the portal vein, consistent with periportal
     edema, likely related to previous surgery.  Surgical clips are seen in the
     right lobe of the liver centrally.  The spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands and
     kidneys are unremarkable.  During the arterial phase of imaging, there is
     patchy and somewhat heterogeneously peripheral enhancement in the left lobe as
     compared to the right lobe of the liver. Portal venous and delayed imaging
     demonstrates more normal enhancement pattern.  There is no evidence of
     infarction.  There is mild enhancement of the common bile duct, again, likely
     related to surgical procedure.  No enhancing liver lesions are identified.
     
     CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST:  There is pelvic fluid.  The bladder and distal ureters
     are unremarkable.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic bone lesions.  Mild
     degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.
     
     There is minimal atelectasis at the right lung base.
     
     LIVER CTA:  FINDINGS:  The celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery, and
     renal arteries are widely patent.  There is an aberrant right hepatic artery.
     The main hepatic artery is widely patent and the right and left tributaries of
     the hepatic artery are visualized and widely patent.  The portal vein and
     hepatic veins are widely patent.
     
     MULTIPLANAR REFORMATIONS were essential in delineating the anatomy and
     pathology, as described above.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     1)  There is an aberrant right hepatic artery.  The main hepatic artery and
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  ARDS.  Evaluate for interval change.
     
     Comparison is made to the chest radiograph from [**2849-5-22**].
     
     AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Again seen are a right internal jugular and left
     subclavian central lines.  The heart size, mediastinal contours and pulmonary
     vasculature are stable in appearance.  Again seen are diffuse patchy and
     confluent areas of opacity within both lungs consistent with ARDS.  There is
     improvement in the intensity of the opacities within both upper lobes.  This
     may indicate a component of superimposed congestive heart failure which has
     improved.  The osseous structures are stable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  ARDS with improvement in bilateral uppper lobe opacities.

     PORTABLE CHEST is compared with  one day earlier.
     
     INDICATION:  ARDS.  Respiratory failure.
     
     An ET tube, bilateral central venous catheters and an NG tube remain in
     place.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in the interval.  A
     bilateral alveolar pattern shows slight interval improvement, and demonstrates
     relative sparing of the lung apices and portions of the lung periphery.  As
     compared to the earlier study of 4/19, there has been even more significant
     improvement.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Improving bilateral alveolar pattern, likely due to provided
     history of ARDS.

Pt. continues to be intubated sedated on mechanical ventilation. Acidemic by blood gas at start of shift, primarily metabolic/lactic acidosis which required increased MV to compensate. Respiratory rate increased along with tidal volume (see careview for details). PAP's in mid 40's on 600cc X34. These changes increased mean airway pressure enough so PEEP level could be reduced to 12.5. Pt. continues to oxygenate relatively well, Fi02 weaned to 50%.

Neuro: Pt unresponsive to verbal stimuli and does not follow commands. Continues on propofol drip at 50mcg/kg/min. No spontaneous movements noted. Pupils react sluggishly to light. I had to ask the intern on call to evaluate her pupils because I could not detect much reaction. He feels that there is no change from previous exam. Stimulation is to be kept to a minimum to keep ICP low. ICP running [**9-13**] this shift. Only went up to 11 with the stimulation of turning to clean her. [**Last Name (un) **] drain is in place and no signs of bleeding noted.

CV: Remains on levophed at .053mcg/kg/min. I did go down slightly in the beginning of the shift only to have to go back up later in shift after the turning. Pt also on vasopressin at .04units/min. BP 90-100/60. MAP 70's. CPP has been greater than 50 as ordered.

Resp: Lungs are clear. No suctioning required. No vent changes made. She remains on AC rate 22, TV 600, FIO 2 40% with 13cm peep. Good sat.

Heme/Fluids: She remians on CVVH with goal fluid removal of 450cc/hr. Goal met most of the day. Clot noted in the filter chamber but it seems to be working fine. Pt getting citrated replacement fluid and requires calcium drip titrated for ionized calcium which is drawn with ABG Q4hrs. Currently calcium drip is running at 70cc/hr. Her INR goal is less than 1.5 and if it goes above this she needs to be transfused FFP. Last INR at 8PM was up to 1.8. Two units FFP ordered and will be given once they become available. Labs are drawn Q4hrs.

GI: Tube feeds shut off due to high residuals even though they were only running at 10cc/hr. Pt stool via rectal mushroom catheter and continues on lactulose TID. Hct stable today at 23.9 most of the day.

Endo: We are checking fingerstick glucose Q2-4hrs. Pt had some hypoglycemia in the past but has been stable for days.

GU: UO low but she is passing small amts urine via foley.

ID: Pt remians on the Bear Hugger due to hypothermia. Last temp 96. WBC 14, stable. Pt is on cipro/fluconazole.

Social: Pt's daughter, husband and father were all in this afternoon and they are aware of the meeting planned tomorrow to update her condition. They fear that they will be told that there is not hope and her daughter was very appropriately crying at her mother's condition.

Resp: Remains vented on AC 22, TV 600, FIO2 40% with 13cm peep. Last PO2 was 73. Pt's sat 95% most of the evening. Lungs fairly clear. I did have to suction her once for thick old blood secretions. Q4hr ABG with ionized calcium still being drawn and will be due at 12 midnight.

GI: Pt NPO due to high residuals when getting tube feeds. Just getting meds via OGT. No bowel sounds. Mushroom catheter in place, 200cc's out via the tube and large amts leakage around the tube noted. Hct dropping down to 21 today. Team will transfuse if hgb <7.0.

Renal: Pt's CVVH was failing and not taking off fluid very well all day. By 9:30PM it was alarming constantly and was not removing fluid at all. CVVH was stopped and system taken down. Pt's Quinton was flushed with NS only. Plan is to not restart therapy and this has been discussed with family. She does have small amt of her own UO. Plan is to take Quinton out tonight after coags are corrected.

Heme: Pt being tranfused with factor VII, Cryo, and FFP as needed. Goal INR is less than 1.5, goal fibrinogen is > 150. Her last INR was up to 2.1 and she is ordered for factor VII and FFP which I will try to infuse ASAP. Q4hrs labs are being drawn including CBC, PT, PTT and chem 7.

Endo: Pt's blood glucose is stable today.

Social: Family meeting held today and family were informed of pt's not responding to one week of aggressive therapy to try to turn the liver failure around. Renal team feel CVVH is not doing pt any good and will not restart the therapy once it stops. Family is aware that this will most likely lead to pt's death. They are aware of the gravity of the situation and want to make sure she is comfortable when it comes to her death. At this point however we will not stop aggressive care. She was made DNR but full treat. We have stopped CVVH due to it clotting off tonight and the plan is to take out the [**Last Name (un) **] Bolt after her INR is less than 1.3.
