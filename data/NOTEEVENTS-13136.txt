History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 79 yo female with PMH significant for HTN, COPD who 
presented to OSH with acute onset of SOB on [**2568-10-20**]. She was 
C/o of mild discomfort on the sides of her upper abd after which 
the SOB started suddenly. Initially she thought that she was 
having a panic attack but then she became diaphoretic and cold. 
Daughters called 911 and she was taken to [**Hospital3 5467**] 
hospital. Her initial O2 sat were 88% on 4L O2 and was afebrile. 
CXR showed extensive B/l alveolar infiltrates more on the rt 
side. A prelim diagnosis of CHF with COPD exacerbation was made 
and she was started on morphine, lasix and solumedrol levaquin, 
ceftriaxone and nebulizers. She was put on BiPaP for her resp 
distress and subsequently was intubated. CTA was negative for 
PE. An echo performed revealed MVP with severe MR. At the 
request of the family the pt is transferred to [**Hospital3 **].  
 
ROS: Generalized fatigue for the past few months. Cough with 
blood for about 2 months. Abd gas pain. No h/o CP, palpitaions, 
dizziness, syncope, orthopnea, PND or pedal edema. Daughters say 
that the pt has lost significant weight in the last few months.

ECHO [**2568-10-25**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 
80%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not 
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe mitral 
valve prolapse. There is partial mitral leaflet flail. Severe 
(4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet 
is eccentric. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
Tricuspid valve prolapse is present. Severe [4+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial 
effusion. The effusion appears loculated. There is brief right 
atrial diastolic collapse. There is significant, accentuated 
respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, 
consistent with impaired ventricular filling. 

Impression: mitral and tricuspid valve prolapse with flail 
mitral leaflets; severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation with 
hyperdynamic left ventricular contractile function 
.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is 79 y/o f with wide open MR, CHF and pnumonia. She was 
admitted to the CCU. 
.
1) Cardiac:
Patient was admitted to the coronary care unit for management. 
Her fentanyl drip was increased to provide sedation for the 
insertion of an arterial line. After the procedure the patient 
developed hypotension which was subsequently reversed by 
naloxone. She was later started on nipride drip for persistent 
hypotension. 
Pt had cardiac cath which showed normal coronaries with elevated 
pressures. A decision to take the patient for mitral valve 
replacement surgery was made after discussion with the family 
and therefore B/l chest tubes were placed to drain the pleural 
effusion post cath. Hct dropped from 26.4 to 24.6 after chest 
tube insertion and the pt received 1 unit of PRBC. Later the 
family reconsidered their decison and the patient's daughter who 
is also the health care proxy refused surgery. With the wishes 
of the family the patient was then extubated and she maintained 
spontaneous ventilation. We were able to communicate with her 
and she expressed that she did not want any kind of intervention 
to prolong her life including ET tube, chest tube or any 
surgery. Subsequently after discussion with the family the pt's 
status was changed to comfort measures only and she was started 
on morphine drip.
.
2) Pulmonary:
She was also started on antibiotics (Ceftriaxone and 
Azithromycin for pneumonia) and maintained on the ventilator. 
She was oxygenating adequately. As noted previously she was 
extubated and code status changed to CMO.
.
The patient expired on comfort measures only on Thursday evening 
([**2568-10-27**]).

     No comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:  The study is somewhat limited due to positioning, and right
     costophrenic angle is not fully included.  The patient is status post
     intubation, with endotracheal tube terminating approximately 1.5 cm above the
     carina.  Thoracic aorta is tortuous.  The heart is top normal in size.  Note
     is made of increased interstitial markings and perihilar opacity especially on
     the right, with bilateral effusion.  There are bilateral lower lobe opacities,
     more prominent on the right.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Somewhat limited study.  Endotracheal tube terminating 1.5 cm
     above the carina.  Congestive heart failure with interstitial edema and
     effusion.  Bilateral lower lobe opacities, more prominent on the right,
     worrisome for multifpcal pneumonia in this patient with fever.
     
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6923**] was informed by telephone immediately after the completion of the

     presented with mitral valve prolapse.
     
     COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph obtained on the same day.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast images of the chest were obtained.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is an endotracheal tube that
     terminates above the carina.  There is a nasogastric tube that terminates in
     the stomach.  Swan-Ganz catheter enters from below and terminates in the
     distal portions of the right main pulmonary artery.  Bilateral chest tubes are
     in place, with the chest tube on the right with distal tip in the posterior
     costophrenic sulcus.  The left chest tube distal tip projects in the region of
     the more anterior lower thorax with images of the stomach nearly superimposed,
     probably due to volume averaging.  There is a right-sided pleural effusion and
     possibly a small left-sided pleural effusion.  There is bilateral lower lobe
     dense consolidation, right worse than left.  There are emphysematous changes
     of the lungs.  There are scattered patchy areas of ground-glass opacity, right
     worse than left.
     
     Limited images of the upper abdomen demonstrate atherosclerosis of the aorta.
     Contrast is seen within the collecting systems of the kidneys, probably from
     the patient's recent cardiac catheterization.  There may be a malrotated right
     kidney.
     
     Bone windows reveal degenerative changes with no suspicious lytic or sclerotic
     lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Bilateral lower lobe consolidation.
     2.  Small right-sided pleural effusion and patchy bilateral areas of ground-
     glass opacity and interlobular septal thickening, right worse than left may
     represent a component of mild pulmonary edema.
     3.  Lines and tubes as described above.

     examination obtained during the evening of the preceding day ([**2568-10-24**]).  The patient remains intubated, the ETT and NG tube remaining in
     unchanged position.  A Swan-Ganz catheter has been approached from below and
     reaches the central portion of the right PA.  The previously described diffuse
     pulmonary densities most marked in the central portions remain and indicate
     persistent pulmonary edema.  Pleural effusion may have increased as judged
     from the degree of blunting of the left lateral pleural sinus.  The heart is
     only moderately enlarged.  Noteworthy is the presence of rather advanced
     calcifications in the mitral ring.  Water-soluble contrast media collection in
     the left kidney is noted and indicates moments of contrast CT during the
     latest interval.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Persistent pulmonary edema, successful advancement of Swan-Ganz
     from below.
