Chief Complaint:
dyspnea 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none
 
History of Present Illness:
70M sent from [**Hospital1 **] w/ h/o recent PNA, as well as CHF, COPD 
presents after noted to be dyspneic and hypoxic at [**Hospital1 **]. Room air 
sat on arrival was low 80s, was given O2, Steroids, Bipap, and 
rose to 90s-100s. HR initially 130s-> improved to 110s. 
Transiently dropped pressure to 80s, but came up spontaneously. 
Gas 7.31/67/85 on Bipap. Pt adamantly refused intubation in ED, 
initially agreed to short term BIPAP, refusing after short trial 
in MICU. He states his breathing currently feels well. Pt states 
he has 4 sons, but he wants to make his own medical decisions, 
and is very clear that he does not want intubation. He denies 
any recent fever, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain. He has 
lower back pain where is he noted to have diffusely macerated 
skin. Initial trial at foley insertion with pus returned. Pt 
states he has chronic indwelling foley after past surgery. 
.
In ED labs significant for BNP 3800, elevated troponin with Cr 
1.0, although prior hx of renal failure. Also noted to have RBBB 
on EKG, but no STT changes per ED. CXR limited by motion. Given 
Vanco/levo in ED in addition to 20mg lasix IV.  
.  
Pt refused intubation in ED, prior documentation at rehab with 
full code.  

Note he was admitted to OSH mid May to [**2627-5-28**] after being found 
on floor in feces. Treated that admit for ARF, hepatitis, 
pneumonia.

CXR [**6-12**]: AP semiupright view.  Evaluation is limited by patient 
positioning and body habitus.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours 
are unchanged.  There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions, 
left greater than right, and basilar atelectasis, unchanged 
compared to the previous study. 
IMPRESSION:  Limited study. No interval change 
.
R LENI [**6-8**]: IMPRESSION:  Limited study secondary to patient 
body habitus.  No evidence of DVT seen within the right common 
femoral, proximal superficial femoral, and popliteal veins. 
.
Head CT [**6-4**]:
FINDINGS:  Patient motion and positioning within the scanner 
somewhat limits assessment.  No intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage 
is clearly identified.  There is no mass effect or shift of 
normally midline structures.  The ventricles do not demonstrate 
any hydrocephalus.  The basal cisterns are visualized. Paranasal 
sinuses appear clear.  The patient is edentulous.  Soft tissue 
structures appear unremarkable. 
.  
IMPRESSION:  Limited study.  No obvious intracranial hemorrhage 
or mass 
effect. 
.  
Note added at attending review: There is an incompletely 
visualized expansile mass in the left maxillary alveolar ridge 
and there is a partially calcified mass in the left frontal 
sinus. Ct scan of the facial bones suggested. 
.
CT Sinus, prelim read: 2.4 x 1.4 cm expansile mass in the left 
maxillary alveolar ridge.  There is thinning of the cortical 
margins and areas of focal dehiscense.  The findings may be 
consistent with an ameloblastoma.  Partially calcified mass in 
the left frontal sinus. Right maxillary and ethmoid sinus 
mucosal thickening.  
.
TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or  color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The  left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a  focal wall 
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right 
ventricular  cavity is mildly dilated. Right ventricular 
systolic function is normal. The aortic root is moderately 
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally 
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.  
There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
estimated pulmonary  artery systolic pressure is normal. There 
is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
COPD exacerbation -  Initially admitted to the MICU. No previous 
available ABG values, however initial ABG with partly 
compensated respiratory acidosis and component of newly worsened 
hypercarbia c/w COPD exacerbation. Pt became progressively 
sedated over the course of HOD #1 -> continued on BIPAP, pCO2 
trended up to 76 (ABG 7.31/76/154).  Pt became more arousable 
overnight with continued BIPAP, repeat ABG 7.38/65/188.  He was 
started on high dose steroids with solumedrol 125 mg q6hrs and 
Q4H scheduled atrovent/albuterol nebs, q2hrs prn.  Placed on 
ceftriaxone, azithromycin for cough, productive of yellow 
sputum, recent pneumonia, finished a course of this in-house.  
On HOD #2 pt. refused further positive pressure ventilation, 
BiPAP, or intubation.  Repeat ABGs with pCO2 as high as 80, 
pH>7.30.  Prednisone was tapered to 40 mg PO, and pt. was 
transferred to the floor as he was refusing any invasive 
ventilation.
.
On the floor pt. continued to have elevated PCO2 levels, which 
peaked at 95 and then trended down to 70s.  Pt. had no further 
sedation or AMS.  He maintained O2 sats 88-92% on 4 L 
throughout.  Prednisone was weaned to 30 mg QD after 5 days at 
40 mg, and a slow wean should be continued in rehab.
.
CHF exacerbation - EF 55-60% on TTE, evidence of diastolic 
dysfunction (see results above).  Difficult to evaluate fluid 
status on CXR although he did have marked LE edema on exam, and 
elevated BNP suggested CHF exacerbation.  Diuresed with lasix 
40mg IV bid, Bun/Cr stable in MICU, with ~ 1L negative QD in the 
MICU.  This was initially continued on the floor, and then 
decreased to 40 mg daily as he was 2-3 L negative daily -> 1-1.5 
negative with 40 IV QD.  On discharge lasix was d/ced and Bumex 
reinitiated at 1 mg QD, along with aldactone, which was started 
for K+ sparing and to avoid contraction alkalosis.
.
# CAD - elevated troponin on presentation suggestive of previous 
ischemic event, trended down.  Continued ASA, metoprolol, 
losartan.  No need for statin based on lipids, LDL<70.  Noted to 
have allergic reaction to heparin in past, appears most likely 
had thrombocytopenia?, but HIT negative.  Covered with 
Fondaparinux for DVT prophylaxis in house as it is safe if he 
really did have HIT in past.
.  
# HTN - continued losartan, metoprolol.  Started on Aldactone on 
discharge for K+ sparing and to avoid contraction alkalosis (pt. 
was beginning to develop a contraction alkalosis from lasix).  
. 
# A Fib: continued beta-blocker.  Elected not to anti-coagulate 
given acute illness, bleeding risk, though this should be 
considered in the future. He had converted back to NSR at 65 BPM 
by discharge.
. 
# Mass L maxillary ridge- this was noted incidentally on Head CT 
performed in MICU.  It was followed up with a CT sinus, the 
prelim read of which showed a mass concerning for ameloblastoma. 
 ENT was consulted and recommended outpatient work-up by OMFS 
and ENT (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3882**] from ENT reviewed imaging and felt that it 
was c/w frontal sinus osteoma).  Final read of sinus CT was 
pending at time of discharge and should be follow up by Dr. 
[**First Name (STitle) 3882**]. He will see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3882**] in about 2 weeks.

# UTI - treated with ceftriaxone and then cefepime in-house and 
discharged on the rest of a 12 day course (see urine culture 
above) 
.  
# Decubitus ulcer - no clear cellulitis, but given past 
colonization with MRSA, elevated WBC, initially covered with 
vancomycin, stopped after cx's negative x48 hrs, afebrile.  
- frequent turns
- continued skin care as recommended by wound care consult (see 
page 2 attached)
.  
# FEN: cardiac diet
.
* Prophylaxis: no heparin products given previous allergy. 
Pneumoboots/Fondaparinux, PPI.
.
* Code status: DNR/DNI, no non-invasive ventilation per several 
discussions with pt.

By discharge the patient was much improved but still 
significantly SOB with any exertion in bed.  He needs more 
diuresis. At rest his Sa02 was 92-96% on 3-4 L o2.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Bedside PICC unsuccessful and the patient requires prolonged IV
     antibiotics.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 620**] [**Name (STitle) 621**], Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4524**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4525**], and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2935**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2339**] with
     Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2339**], the attending radiologist, present and supervising throughout the
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  As no suitable superficial veins were present, the deep venous
     system of the left upper extremity was examined with ultrasound.  The left
     brachial vein was found to be patent and compressible.  Standard sterile prep
     and drape of the left arm.  Local anesthesia with 10 cc of 1% lidocaine
     subcutaneously.  Using realtime ultrasound guidance, a 21-gauge needle was
     advanced into the left brachial vein.  Hardcopy ultrasound images pre- and
     post-puncture were obtained.  A 0.018-inch guidewire was advanced through the
     needle and the needle was exchanged for the introducer sheath.  A 5-French
     double-lumen [**Last Name (un) 1828**] PICC was placed through the sheath and positioned with
     its tip in the superior vena cava using fluoroscopic guidance.  The peel-away
     sheath was removed.  Both lumens of the catheter flushed and aspirated well,
     were capped and saline locked.  The catheter was fixed in place with a
     Statlock device and a sterile transparent dressing was applied.  Final limited
     chest radiograph confirmed the catheter tip position in the expected region of
     the superior aspect of the superior vena cava.  There is evidence of bilateral
     pleural effusions, cardiomegaly, and possible atelectasis or consolidation of
     the right lower lobe.  Suggest correlation with a dedicated chest radiograph
     performed earlier today.
     
     The catheter can be used immediately.
     
     There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 5-French 60 cm PICC ([**Last Name (un) 1828**]) by way
     of the left brachial vein with tip in the superior vena cava.  The catheter
     can be used immediately.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Evaluate for DVT.
     
     FINDINGS:  This is a limited study secondary to patient body habitus.
     Grayscale and Doppler sonograms of the right common femoral, proximal
     superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed. These demonstrate
     normal compressibility, waveforms, and flow in the common femoral, proximal
     superficial femoral, and popliteal veins. No intraluminal thrombus is
     identified within these vessels. The mid and distal right superficial femoral
     veins were not adequately visualized.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Limited study secondary to patient body habitus.  No evidence of
     DVT seen within the right common femoral, proximal superficial femoral, and
     popliteal veins.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      can [**Doctor First Name 1041**] place IR guided PICC for IV antibiotics?                                
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Bedside PICC unsuccessful and the patient requires prolonged IV
     antibiotics.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 620**] [**Name (STitle) 621**], Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4524**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4525**], and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2935**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2339**] with
     Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2339**], the attending radiologist, present and supervising throughout the
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  As no suitable superficial veins were present, the deep venous
     system of the left upper extremity was examined with ultrasound.  The left
     brachial vein was found to be patent and compressible.  Standard sterile prep
     and drape of the left arm.  Local anesthesia with 10 cc of 1% lidocaine
     subcutaneously.  Using realtime ultrasound guidance, a 21-gauge needle was
     advanced into the left brachial vein.  Hardcopy ultrasound images pre- and
     post-puncture were obtained.  A 0.018-inch guidewire was advanced through the
     needle and the needle was exchanged for the introducer sheath.  A 5-French
     double-lumen [**Last Name (un) 1828**] PICC was placed through the sheath and positioned with
     its tip in the superior vena cava using fluoroscopic guidance.  The peel-away
     sheath was removed.  Both lumens of the catheter flushed and aspirated well,
     were capped and saline locked.  The catheter was fixed in place with a
     Statlock device and a sterile transparent dressing was applied.  Final limited
     chest radiograph confirmed the catheter tip position in the expected region of
     the superior aspect of the superior vena cava.  There is evidence of bilateral
     pleural effusions, cardiomegaly, and possible atelectasis or consolidation of
     the right lower lobe.  Suggest correlation with a dedicated chest radiograph
     performed earlier today.
     
     The catheter can be used immediately.
     
     There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 5-French 60 cm PICC ([**Last Name (un) 1828**]) by way
     of the left brachial vein with tip in the superior vena cava.  The catheter
     can be used immediately.

      2.4 x 1.4 cm expansile mass in the left maxillary alveolar ridge.  The cortex
      appears preserved.  Partially calcified mass in the left frontal sinus.  Right
      maxillary and ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  70-year-old with hypoxia and COPD with maxillary lesion noted on
     head CT scan.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT images of the maxillofacial sinuses without the
     administration of IV contrast.  Coronal reformatted images were obtained.
     
     Comparison is made to head CT performed [**2627-6-4**].
     
     FINDINGS:  In the left maxillary alveolar ridge extending to the midline,
     there is a 1.4 x 2.4 x 1.8 cm expansile lytic slightly aggressive-appearing
     lesion.  Areas of cortical breakthrough along the anterior maxillary margin
     are seen.  This lesion extends superiorly to the floor of the left maxillary
     sinus, but there is no definite invasion into the left maxillary sinus.  The
     maxilla itself otherwise is osteopenic in appearance.  There may be a soft
     tissue component associated with this lesion given internal Hounsfield unit
     attenuation levels of 33.
     
     In the left frontal sinus, there is a 9 x 12 mm rounded somewhat lobulated
     partially peripherally calcified lesion.  Minimal mucosal thickening is seen
     within the ethmoid sinuses and right maxillary sinus.  Degenerative changes
     are seen of the dens.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Expansile, slightly aggressive lytic lesion seen in the left maxillary
     alveolar ridge.  Appearance is somewhat nonspecific and the differential would
     include entities such as aneurysmal bone cyst, periapical abscess, or an
     ameloblastoma. MRI may be helpful in delineating solid versus cystic
     components of this mass.
