History of Present Illness:
85yo woman with PMH significant for atrial fibrillation on 
coumadin, h/o stroke in 11/05 with residual left sided weakness 
and dysarthria, hyperlipidemia presented with left sided 
shaking. She was was last seen well at 8pm the evening of 
admission and was then found on the floor of the bathroom around 
midnight. Her daughter heard her call out that she couldn't get 
up; she was lodged between the toilet and the wall. She was 
unable to stand without assistance; she did not answer queries 
to where she was. She was ""looking off to her left"" according to 
her daughter and was not saying much. She then started shaking 
on her left side (beginning with curling of her left side). The 
daughter's vantage point was behind the patient and she is 
unsure of which side was shaking or if both were. 

Per history, EMS found her awake but with R-sided weakness and 
""+GTC seizure activity (eyes deviated towards the right) lasting 
<1minute at a time"". She received two rounds of ativan 3mg and 
another two doses of valium 5mg and was intubated at the scene 
by EMS for airway protection.

She presented to [**Hospital1 19**] and a code stroke was called.

Review of systems per her daughter: +malaise, for which she 
presented to her PCP one week prior. No neck pain, headache, 
cough, fever, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.
 
Past Medical History:
Stroke, as above; required her to walk with a walker
Recent urinary tract infection, treated with ciprofloxacin from

[**2731-4-27**] Ammonia-40
.
.
Studies:
.
CXR ([**4-16**]): Mild hydrostatic edema presumably cardiogenic in 
etiology. 
Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis, although an 
underlying 
infection cannot be entirely excluded.  
.
Head CT ([**4-16**]): No CT evidence of acute cortical stroke.  Chronic 
ischemic 
changes and age-appropriate atrophy as above 
.
CTA/CTP ([**4-16**]):  
1. Small, 3 mm focal dilatation at the origin of the posterior 
communicating artery and the internal carotid artery on the left 
could represent an aneurysm.  
2. 50% stenoses of the left common carotid artery at the level 
of the bulb and the origin of the left internal carotid artery, 
respectively.  
3. 60% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery in the 
neck.  
4. Diffuse. vascular atherosclerotic, calcific disease.  
.
MRI/A ([**4-16**]):
1. No evidence of acute infarction by diffusion-weighted 
imaging.  
2. Subacute versus chronic, likely chronic right posterior 
cerebral artery territory infarct in the occipital lobe.  
3. Evidence of small vessel ischemia.  
4. Three-mm aneurysm extending posteriorly of the left 
supraclinoid portion of the internal carotid artery.  
.
Head CT ([**4-20**]): Stable appearance of the brain.
.
CT c-spine ([**4-16**]): Severe degenerative changes throughout the 
cervical spine somewhat limiting assessment. Possible fractures 
identified at the left anterior arch of C1, as well as within 
the dens.  MRI is recommended for further evaluation. 
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] ([**4-18**]): 1.  The changes seen on CT at C1-2 level 
appear to be due to advanced degenerative change with thickening 
of the transverse ligament and degenerative pannus formation.  
No evidence of fracture of the odontoid process or lateral 
masses of C1 or C2 identified. 2.  Changes of cervical 
spondylosis predominantly from C3-4 to C6-7. 3.  No evidence of 
intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities or extrinsic 
spinal cord compression. 4.  No evidence of ligamentous 
disruption. 
.
Abd u/s ([**4-27**]): 1.  Distended gallbladder with asymmetric edema 
within the gallbladder wall, indeterminate for the presence or 
absence of acute cholecystitis.  Recommend further 
characterization with a HIDA scan. 2.  Prominent CBD, measuring 
0.96 cm in size.  The distal CBD and head of the pancreas are 
not well seen- recommend further visualization with contrast 
enhanced CT of the Abdomen. 3. Pedunculated cystic lesion 
projecting between the lateral left lobe of the liver and the 
pancreas. The origin of this cystic lesion is incompletely 
resolved with the current study and further characterization 
with a CT scan is recommended. 
.
RUQ US [**4-29**]:
1. Limited evaluation of the liver, without focal mass lesions. 
Normal hepatic vasculature.
2. Minimal gallbladder wall edema and sludge are identified. The 
edema would be consistent with third spacing of fluid related to 
the patient's underlying hepatic disease.
.
ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall 
motion is normal. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function 
is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular 
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is 
eccentric and may be underestimated. There is borderline 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. 
Moderate mitral regurgitation with mildly thickened leaflets and 
supporting structures. 
.
EEG ([**4-16**]): Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the very low 
voltage 
slow background and with bursts of generalized slowing. There 
were some 
periods with a markedly suppressed background. These findings 
indicate 
a widespread encephalopathy. 
.
EEG ([**4-20**]): : This 24-hour EEG telemetry captured no 
electrographic 
seizures. No interictal epileptiform discharges were seen. The 
background was slow and disorganized throughout much of the 
recording 
indicating a mild to moderate encephalopathy. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 1772**] was admitted to the neurology ICU after being 
intubated for airway protection after receiving several rounds 
of ativan for seizure activity. Hospital course was complicated 
and is reviewed below by problem.

1. seizure: The episode prior to presentation was concerning for 
a seizure. She had no prior seizure history, but she had had a 
stroke, which could act as seizure focus. For further 
evaluation, she underwent CTA, MRA, and EEG. The CTA and MRI 
were negative for infarction or stenosis, but showed a 3mm 
aneurysm extending posteriorly of the left supraclinoid portion 
of the internal carotid artery, which will need to be followed 
as an outpatient. EEG initially showed very low voltage slow 
background and with bursts of generalized slowing, consistent 
with encephalopathy. Repeat showed some improvement but 
persistent findings of a mild to moderate encephalopathy. It was 
thought that she had a symptomatic seizure secondary to 
infection. She was not put on any antiepileptic medications and 
had no further evidence of seizures. 

2. encephalopathy: This was initially thought to be secondary to 
infection. Tox screen was negative. She was treated for presumed 
PNA for 7 days and seemed to improve, but then her mental status 
began to decline after extubation ([**4-23**], [**4-24**]) with worsening 
over the next several days. Lumbar puncture had initially been 
considered, but given her improvement it was thought to be low 
yield. With decreased responsiveness, the lumbar puncture was 
again considered. However, she initially had some respiratory 
difficulties making a lumbar puncture high risk (she would have 
needed ativan for agitation, with concern for reintubation), and 
then she had an elevated INR which did not come down to 1.5 even 
after several units of FFP. She was considered to have a low 
suspicion for meningitis, but was started on ceftriaxone, 
vancomycin, and ampicillin on [**4-27**] for empiric coverage, as the 
lumbar puncture could not be performed.  On transfer to the 
Medical ICU, lumbar puncture was attempted, but was unsucessful.

3. respiratory distress: Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 1772**] required intubation twice 
for respiratory failure and once for concerns of decreased 
responsiveness with an episode of apnea. On [**4-24**] the pulmonary 
service was consulted as the patient was wheezing and was noted 
to have increased work of breathing (using accessory muscles, 
tachypneic). A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed (see 
above). She was started on budesonide and diuresed with 
improvement of the wheezing.

4. atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulation was established with 
heparin gtt whenever coumadin needed to be stopped for 
procedures. She was treated with beta-blockers or IVF as needed 
for tachycardia.

5. acute renal failure: Her creatinine acutely rose on [**4-23**]. 
FeNa was low, and she was thought to be total body overloaded 
but intravascularly dry. She was given albumin and lasix with 
stabilization of the Cr.

6. fever: She was initially treated with ceftriaxone and 
vancomycin for 7 days, but all cultures were negative and the 
antibiotics were discontinued. They were restarted, with 
ampicillin, at meningitic doses on [**4-27**] after the patient 
decompensated with a temperature of 104.  Upon transfer to the 
medical ICU, broad antibiotic coverage with vancomycin, 
ceftriaxone, and zosyn were started.
  
7. transaminitis: She was noted to have an acute rise in ALT and 
AST on [**4-27**]. RUQ u/s showed gall bladder wall edema without 
stones or sludge.  Due to concern for cholangitis, she was 
transferred to the Medical ICU team.  Hepatology and General 
Surgery consulted and recommended repeat US.  A second US was 
obtained and showed minimal gall bladder wall edema with minimal 
sludge.  ERCP was recommended when she was more clinically 
stable.  

8. anemia: She had a slow Hct drop and was given a unit of 
PRBCs. Rectal guaiac was negative and her Hct stabilized. 

9. hypotension: upon transfer to the Medical ICU she was noted 
to have fevers and hypotension.  Upon discussion with her 
family, they brought in evidence of a living will, which 
outlined her preference for no resuscitation.  Her blood 
pressure was supported with IV fluid boluses, per her family's 
request to not use vasopressors.  The subsequent day, she showed 
evidence of worsened liver and renal function, periods of apnea 
on the ventilator, and continued cardiovascular compromise.  A 
family meeting was held with her son, [**Male First Name (un) **] (Health Care Proxy), 
and daughter, [**Doctor First Name **].  The decision was made to change the 
goals of care to comfort only, according to the patient's 
predetermined wishes.  She was extubated and started on a 
morphine drip, titrated to comfort. The patient passed away 
comfortably and was pronounced dead at 8:15pm on [**2731-5-2**].

     AP PORTABLE CHEST, [**2731-4-16**] AT 00:28 HOURS.
     
     HISTORY:  Status post endotracheal tube placement.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     FINDINGS:  Consistent with the given history, an endotracheal tube is in place
     with the distal tip approximately 1.8 cm from the carina.  Lungs are mildly
     underexpanded.  There is pulmonary vascular indistinctness and engorgement of
     the vascular pedicle.  There is subtle increased retrocardiac opacity, which
     is likely due to atelectasis, although a developing consolidation cannot be
     excluded.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle highly suggests a small
     pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Mild hydrostatic edema presumably cardiogenic in etiology.
     Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis, although an underlying
     infection cannot be entirely excluded.  Repeat radiography following
     appropriate diuresis recommended to assess for underlying infection.
     Endotracheal tube placement as above. For optimal placement, consider
     retracting 1 cm.

     COMPARISONS:  CT head from [**2731-4-16**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2-weighted imaging was performed including
     gradient echo imaging, FLAIR imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging and ADC
     mapping.  Time-of-flight imaging of the head was also performed.  Volume
     rendered images were obtained.
     
     MRI BRAIN:  Diffusion-weighted imaging reveals no abnormal areas of signal
     that would be consistent with acute infarction.  FLAIR imaging demonstrates
     extensive hyperintense signal within the periventricular white matter and
     subcortical areas bilaterally indicative of underlying small vessel ischemia.
     Furthermore, within the area of the right occipital lobe, there is a small
     area of hyperintensity which likely represents a subacute or chronic posterior
     cerebral infarction.  There is also evidence of an old infarction within the
     left cerebellum and right thalamus.  The signal intensity values of the brain
     are preserved.  There is no shift of normally midline structures or
     hydrocephalus.
     
     There is mild opacification of the mastoid sinuses bilaterally as well as
     fluid-density secretions within the nasopharynx.  Otherwise, the visualized
     osseous structures, soft tissues, paranasal sinuses are unremarkable.

     CTA OF THE HEAD.
     
     INDICATION:  85-year-old female with atrial fibrillation, found down with
     right-sided weakness.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast MDCT axial images of the head were first acquired.
     Following administration of 130 cc of intravenous Optiray contrast, MDCT axial
     images were acquired from the aortic arch to the cranial vertex.  Multiplanar
     and volume rendered reformatted images were then obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is diffuse atherosclerotic calcific disease of the aortic
     arch.  There is moderate calcified plaque at the carotid bulb that is
     bilateral.  On the left, there is a 50% stenosis of the common carotid artery
     at the bulb level. There is a calcified plaque with 50% stenosis of the left
     internal carotid artery. On the right, there is a calcified plaque with 60%
     stenosis of the internal carotid artery. There is diffuse atherosclerotic
     disease of the petrous and cavernous portions of the internal carotid arteries
     bilaterally. A small outpouching of the wall of the supraclinoid portion of
     the internal carotid artery that points posteriorly and measures approximately
     3 mm could represent a small aneurysm. Otherwise, the middle cerebral arteries
     appear within normal limits. The anterior and posterior cerebral arteries also
     appear within normal limits. The left vertebral artery is hypoplastic and
     there are some foci of atherosclerotic calcific disease.There is marked
     tortuosity and looping of the mid cervical course of the left vertebral
     artery. The right vertebral artery is normal in caliber and contour. The
     basilar appears within normal limits without evidence of significant
     atherosclerotic disease. There are no other focal aneurysmal dilatations or
     areas of stenosis.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Small, 3 mm focal dilatation at the origin of the posterior communicating
     artery and the internal carotid artery on the left could represent an
     aneurysm.
     
     2.  50% stenoses of the left common carotid artery at the level of the bulb
     and the origina of the left internal carotid artery, respectively.

     INDICATION:  85-year-old woman status post fall, evaluate for fracture.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast axial images of the cervical spine were obtained.
     Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also displayed.
     
     FINDINGS:  Severe degenerative change is seen throughout the cervical spine,
     somewhat limiting assessment for subtle fractures.  Cortical irregularity is
     seen at the left anterior arch of C1.  Cortical irregularity is also seen
     through the dens, best seen on sagittal images.  Grade I anterolisthesis of C3
     on C4 is seen.  Severe degenerative change is seen throughout the cervical
     spine with evidence of osteophytes, disc space loss at multiple levels, worse
     at the C5-6 level.  Increased soft tissue seen in the periodontoid region,
     which can be seen in rheumatoid arthritis.  CT does not provide intrathecal
     detail comparable to MRI, however, the thecal sac appears grossly intact.
     Low density in the occipital lobe is better evaluated on MRI performed the
     same day, possibly representing subacute versus chronic infarct.  Likely
     calcified granuloma noted at the right apex. Fluid seen within the esophagus.
     The patient is intubated. Slight heterogeneity of the right thyroid lobe is
     noted.
     
     IMPRESSION: Severe degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine somewhat
     limiting assessment. Possible fractures identified at the left anterior arch
     of C1, as well as within the dens.  MRI is recommended for further evaluation.
     Discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1624**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5330**] at 4 p.m. on [**2731-4-16**].

     HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2731-4-16**] AT 0043 HOURS
     
     HISTORY:  Question of fall versus stroke or seizure.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Serial transverse images were acquired sequentially through the
     brain and reconstructed at stacked 5-mm increments without the benefit of
     intravenous contrast administration.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     FINDINGS:  The extracalvarial soft tissues are unremarkable.  The calvarium
     and skull base are intact.  Cerumen is noted within the left external auditory
     canal.  The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  There is
     atherosclerotic disease in the cavernous and supraclinoid portions of the
     bilateral internal carotid arteries.  The globes are intact with lenses in
     place.
     
     Intracranially, the ventricles are prominent but midline.  Likewise, the
     cortical sulci and subarachnoid cisterns are prominent.  These findings
     reflect an overall generalized brain parenchymal volume loss which is within
     normal limits accounting for the patient's stated age.  There is confluent low
     attenuation in predominantly a periventricular distribution consistent with
     chronic microvascular disease.  A lacunar infarction is evident in the right
     thalamus.  There is no CT evidence of acute cortical stroke or of intracranial
     hemorrhage.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No CT evidence of acute cortical stroke.  Chronic ischemic
     changes and age-appropriate atrophy as above.  No overt findings suggestive of
     traumatic injury to the head.

     History of seizure with CV line pain and Dobhoff tube placement.
     
     Right subclavian CV line is in distal SVC.  The feeding tube is coiled in the
     stomach.  There is persistent opacity at the left base obscuring the left
     hemidiaphragm consistent with atelectasis/consolidation in the left lower
     lobe.  Cannot rule out small left pleural effusion.  Endotracheal tube is 3 cm
     above the carina.  No pneumothorax.

     CLINICAL INDICATION: Status post placement of central venous line and Dobhoff
     tube, evaluate for pneumonia.
     
     PORTABLE CHEST:
     
     Comparison is made with prior chest radiograph from [**2731-4-17**] and [**2731-4-16**].
     
     The tip of the ET tube is approximately 3 cm from the carina.  The right
     subclavian central venous line tip is in the cavoatrial junction.  Tip of the
     feeding tube is coiled in the stomach.  The wire within the feeding tube ends
     well short of the expected standard positioning.
     
     Cardiomegaly appears unchanged.  There is mild interstitial edema bilaterally
     and left lower lobe atelectasis.  There is increasing opacity in the right
     perihilar region which could represent a combination of edema and atelectasis
     with infection being less likely.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     EXAM:  MRI of the cervical spine.
     
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with question fracture of C-spine, rule out
     ligamentous injury.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and gradient echo and T2
     axial images of cervical spine were obtained.  Comparison was made with the CT
     of [**2727-4-16**].
     
     FINDINGS:  At the craniocervical junction, severe degenerative changes and
     thickening of the transverse ligament is identified at the level of dens.
     There is a small well-defined defect seen on the posterior aspect of the dens
     at the level of transverse ligament indicative of cystic changes from
     degeneration.  No obvious marrow edema seen or linear defect identified
     through the dens to indicate a fracture.  Degenerative changes are also seen
     at the anterior atlanto-odontoid joint.  No evidence of subluxation seen.
     There is no evidence of abnormal signal seen in the lateral masses of C1 or C2
     to indicate fracture.  There is no evidence of significant narrowing of the
     spinal canal seen at C1 level.
     
     At C2-3, no abnormalities are seen.
     
     At C3-4, there is disc bulging and posterior ridging with moderate bilateral
     foraminal stenosis and mild spinal stenosis.
     
     At C4-5, there is mild bulging and mild foraminal stenosis seen.
     
     At C5-6, posterior ridging and bulging identified with moderate right-sided
     and mild left-sided foraminal stenosis.
     
     At C6-7, mild disc bulging identified.
     
     From C7-T1 to T3-4 mild degenerative changes noted.  There is loss of cervical
     lordosis but the facet joint alignment is normal.  There is no evidence of
     abnormal signal seen in the ligamentous structures to indicate ligamentous
     disruption.  The prevertebral soft tissue thickness is maintained.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  The changes seen on CT at C1-2 level appear to be due to advanced
     degenerative change with thickening of the transverse ligament and
     degenerative pannus formation.  No evidence of fracture of the odontoid
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  85-year-old woman found down, status post seizure, unable to
     extubate.  Question interval change.
     
     COMPARISONS:  [**2731-4-16**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated, with a nasogastric tube.  There is no
     evidence of intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage.  The ventricles, cisterns and
     sulci are all prominent, consistent with atrophic changes.  There is no mass
     effect, hydrocephalus, or shift of the normally midline structures.  There are
     diffuse hypodense changes in the bilateral cerebral white matter most
     suggestive of chronic small vessel ischemic disease, but the [**Doctor Last Name 8**]-white matter
     differentiation appears intact.  A lacunar infarct in the posterior limb of
     the internal capsule on the right is unchanged.
     
     There is left maxillary sinus mucosal thickening, and air-fluid levels in the
     sphenoid sinuses which can be seen in intubation.  Likewise, there is patchy
     opacification of the left mastoid air cells. No osseous lesion is identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the brain.

     COMPARISON:  [**2731-4-18**].
     
     INDICATION:  Endotracheal tube repositioning.
     
     Examination is technically limited due to marked motion artifact. 
     Endotracheal tube terminates about 3.5 cm above the carina, feeding tube is
     coiled in stomach with distal tip directed cephalad, and right subclavian
     catheter remains in standard position.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
     stable allowing for changes in lung volumes.  Improving aeration is present in
     the left lower lung.  Diffuse hazy opacities in right perihilar and basilar
     regions, probably represent asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Small pleural
     effusions are noted.  Please note that the degree of respiratory motion limits
     assessment for subtle abnormalities including pneumothoraces.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Seizure.  CHF.
     
     Single portable radiograph of the chest again demonstrates bibasilar
     atelectasis, similar to that seen on [**2731-4-25**].  Patchy bilateral airspace
     opacities also remain similar in appearance.  There may be a faint persistent
     left retrocardiac opacity, also similar in appearance.  Diagnostic quality is
     slightly limited by respiratory motion.  There is evidence of left lateral
     seventh and eight, and possibly ninth, rib fractures.  No pneumothorax.  The
     aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The cardiomediastinal contours are
     unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Support lines unchanged.
     
     Persistent bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions.
     
     Persistent patchy increased airspace opacity involving the bilateral lungs. 
     Diagnostic considerations include pulmonary edema, although pneumonia is not
     excluded.  The findings are similar to that seen on the previous study.
     
     Support lines unchanged.
     
     Left lateral seventh, eighth, and ninth rib fractures with callus formation. 
     The findings represent subacute injury.  No pneumothorax.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Evaluate for cholecystitis, patient with fever and transaminitis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Portable images of the abdomen were obtained.  No prior
     examinations are available for direct comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:  The gallbladder is distended, measuring approximately 4.9 x 4.2 x
     10.5 cm in maximal transverse x AP x craniocaudad dimensions, respectively.
     There is asymmetric wall edema visualized along the gallbladder fossa adjacent
     to the liver measuring 0.6 cm in thickness.  No intraluminal gallstone or
     sludge is seen.  Findings are nondiagnostic for the presence of cholecystitis
     and further characterization with HIDA scan is recommended.
     
     Adjacent to the left lobe of the liver, there is a 3.5 x 3.2 cm cystic lesion
     that is indeterminate in origin, either arising from the left lobe of the
     liver or from the pancreas.  Further characterization with an abdominal CT is
     recommended.
     
     The pancreas is not well visualized due to overlying bowel gas.  The common
     bile duct is distended measuring 0.96 cm.  Distal aspect of the common bile
     duct is not seen due to shadowing bowel gas.
     
     The right kidney measures approximately 11 cm in size.  The left kidney
     measures 10.1 cm in size.
     
     There is no ascites within the abdomen.
     
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Distended gallbladder with asymmetric edema within the gallbladder wall,
     indeterminate for the presence or absence of acute cholecystitis.  Recommend
     further characterization with a HIDA scan.
     2.  Prominent CBD, measuring 0.96 cm in size.  The distal CBD and head of the
     pancreas are not well seen- recommend further visualization with contrast
     enhanced CT of the Abdomen.
     3. Pedunculated cystic lesion projecting between the lateral left lobe of the
     liver and the pancreas. The origin of this cystic lesion is incompletely
     resolved with the current study and further characterization with a CT scan is
     recommended.

     out stroke or intracranial hemorrhage.
     
     COMPARISON:  Non-contrast head CT dated [**2731-4-20**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Routine non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift
     of normally midline structures.  There is no significant change in the
     appearance of the brain since prior study.  Low attenuation in the
     periventricular and subcortical white matter is associated with chronic
     microvascular infarction.  A lacunar infarct in the right thalamus/posterior
     limb of the internal capsule is chronic.There is an old right occipital
     infarct. Prominence of the ventricles and sulci is age appropriate.
     
     Mucosal thickening in bilateral maxillary sinuses, is unchanged.  Fluid in the
     ethmoid and sphenoid air cells is slightly increased.  There is persistent
     fluid opacification and scattered bilateral mastoid air cells.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Stable appearance of the brain.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  85-year-old female with mental status changes, intubated with
     transaminitis and edematous gallbladder on right upper quadrant ultrasound.
     Evaluate for abdominal source of infection.
     
     COMPARISON:  Abdominal ultrasound dated [**2731-4-27**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed
     following the administration of 130 cc of intravenous Optiray.  Coronal and
     sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
     
     CT CHEST WITH ORAL, WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:   Likley moderate stenosis left
     subclavian at vertebral origin with severe atherosclerosis. The patient is
     intubated and a nasogastric tube is in place with the tip in the stomach body.
     A left subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC. There are
     scattered coronary artery and aortic calcifications. The heart and great
     vessels are otherwise unremarkable. There is a tiny pericardial effusion at
     the base.  There are small, bilateral nonhemorrhagic layering pleural effusion
     with compressive atelectasis. Scattered peripheral areas of airspace
     consolidation may represent atelectasis or early pneumonia.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH ORAL, WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver parenchyma
     enhances normally.  Multiple areas of low attenuation are identified, some of
     which were seen on abdominal ultrasound from earlier today may represents
     cysts or hemangiomas.  A pedunculated lesion in the perisplenic region
     identified on prior ultrasound corresponds with a 3.1 x 2.3 cm likely cyst or
     hemangioma in the left liver lobe.
     
     The gallbladder remains distended and thick walled, without radiopaque
     gallstones or prominent CBD dilatation.  Pancreas enhances normally without
     significant peripancreatic stranding.  The spleen is nonenlarged.  A 19 x 21
     mm enhancing nodule in the left adrenal gland is incompletely characterized on
     this single-phase study.  Small low-density lesions in both kidneys
     statistically represent simple cysts, but are too small to characterize.  Both
     kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically and there is no
     hydronephrosis.  The abdominal loops of large and small bowel are normal in
     caliber and contour.  There is some minimal amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
     No fluid collections or abscesses are identified.

     CT PELVIS WITH ORAL, WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  A Foley catheter is seen
     within a partially collapsed bladder.  The distal ureters, sigmoid, rectum,
     uterus and adnexa are unremarkable.  There is no inguinal or pelvic
     lymphadenopathy.  There is a small amount of intrapelvic ascites.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no findings concerning for malignancy within the
     imaged bones.  There are mild/moderate degenerative changes, most prominent at
     L4 through S1.  T12 vertebral body compression deformity may be acute or
     chronic.  There are multiple old, partially healed left-sided rib fractures.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Thickened, edematous-appearing gallbladder corresponding with this
     appearance on comparison ultrasound.  This may represent acalculous
     cholecystitis in the correct clinical setting, and correlation with HIDA scan
     is recommended.

     corresponds with the low attenuation lesion in the left liver lobe, likely
     representing a cyst or hemangioma.
     
     3.  No intraabdominal abscesses or fluid collections identified.
     
     4.  Moderately large bilateral nonhemorrhagic layering pleural effusions with
     compressive atelectasis.  Peripheral areas of airspace consolidation in both
     lungs likely represent atelectasis.
     
     5.  Enhancing left adrenal lesion measuring up to 2 cm is incompletely
     characterized, and can be further evaluated with dedicated MRI and CT.
     
     6.  Small intraabdominal ascites.
     
     7.  Degenerative changes within the thoracic and lumbar spine.  T12
     compression deformities may be acute or chronic and clinical correlation is

     FINDINGS:
     Dobbhoff tube terminates beneath the diaphragm with distal tip not visualized
     on current radiograph and there has been interval removal of right-sided
     central venous catheter.  Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 1.5 cm
     from the carina with the  chin-flexed and there is stable position to left-
     sided central venous catheter.  Ill-defined right upper lobe opacity appears
     improved when compared to film taken at approximately 10:50 a.m. likely
     representing resolution of either asymmetric pulmonary edema or irregular area
     of atelectasis.  There is unchanged appearance to lack of lucency within the
     left mainstem bronchus and probable left lower lobe collapse.  Increased hazy
     opacity projecting over the right base likely represents layering small
     pleural effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Tip of feeding tube beneath the diaphragm and likely within the stomach
     but not visualized.
     2.  Unchanged probable mucoid impaction of left mainstem bronchus and left
     lower lobe collapse.
     3.  Small layering right-sided pleural effusion.
     4.  Improvement to right upper lobe opacity.  Given rapid change, it likely
     represents either resolving atelectasis or asymmetrical edema, possibly
     related to aspiration pneumonitis.

     FINDINGS:
     
     Left subclavian central venous catheter terminates within the mid SVC and
     there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  There has been interval loss of
     definition of the left main stem bronchus and increased obscuration of the
     left hemidiaphragm and retrocardiac opacity likely representing left lower
     lobe collapse, possibly related to mucoid impaction.  Additionally, an ill-
     defined airspace opacity projecting over the right upper lobe has increased in
     density since most recent radiograph.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
     stable as is rib fracture deformity involving the left hemithorax.  Right-
     sided central venous catheter and endotracheal tube are in standard position
     and a Dobbhoff feeding tube now terminates within the stomach.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Standard position of lines and tubes without evidence of pneumothorax.
     2.  Increasing right upper lobe opacity is worrisome for a developing
     pneumonia.
     3.  Left lower lobe collapse likely due to mucous plugging.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  85-year-old woman with transaminitis and fever, evaluate for
     hepatic thrombosis.
     
     LIVER DOPPLER ULTRASOUND:  Grayscale images of the liver are limited,
     demonstrate no focal hepatic mass.  There is no intrahepatic biliary
     dilatation.  There is minimal gallbladder wall edema and some sludge.  The
     head of the pancreas is normal in appearance.
     
     Doppler evaluation of the hepatic vasculature demonstrates a patent portal
     vein and its branches, with normal waveforms and hepatopetal flow.  The
     hepatic veins are patent.  The hepatic artery branches demonstrate good
     arterial upstrokes.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Limited evaluation of the liver, without focal mass lesions.  Normal
     hepatic vasculature.
     2.  Minimal gallbladder wall edema and sludge are identified.  The edema would
     be consistent with third spacing of fluid related to the patient's underlying
     hepatic disease.

Nursing Progress Note:

Family meeting held and pt. will probably be made CMO sometime this evening. Family getting in touch with other family members before final decision is made.

Neuro: Pt. received sedated on Propofol but this was changed to Fentanyl gtt with prn Versed boluses. Pt. is now on 50mcg/hour Fentanyl and requires infrequent 1mg Versed boluses. She responds to painful stimuli by localizing pain, shakes her head ""no"" but does not follow commands and only occasionally opens eyes to pain. Still unsure of etiology of mental status change. LP was unsuccessful. Pt. MAE in bed and her pupils are 3mm and briskly reactive.

HR: 90s-120s a-fib with rare PVCs. Pt. did have one episode of HR in 50s which resolved spontaneously. BP 100s-110s/50s-70s. BP fell into 70s/40s (non-invasive BP correlates) so pt. received one 500cc NS bolus which brought BP back into normal range. Arterial line is in R upper arm and is ecchymotic but has good wave form and  is slightly postional when drawing labs. L SC TLC is WNL.

Resp: Pt. is intubated and was received on CPAP 35%/[**9-18**] but was having apneic episodes so she was placed on AC 450X14/35%/5. Lungs are course to upper lobes with diminished bases. Pt. suctioned for small to moderate amounts of thick, white secretions.

GI: BSX4,liquid brown stool via mushroom catheter. Pt. has Dobhoff and is NPO except meds.

GU: UO marginal via foley. Team aware. Pt. thought to be in ARF due to hypotension.

Endo: FSBG covered by sliding scale.

Skin: Intact

Social: Family meeting held with team and attending with son (HCP) and daughter present. Family apprised of decline in pt. status despite all efforts to manage her condition. Pt. has failed extubation twice and no known source of infection can be found. Social work in contact with family, family seems to be responding appropriately. Chaplain also in to see family. No final decision has been made yet but may be made early this evening.
