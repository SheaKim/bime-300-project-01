Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M h/o ?CAD, diastolic CHF, chronic A.F., ESRD on HD who 
developed mental status changes after dialysis on Friday and was 
admitted with a multilobar, possibly bilateral pneumonia. 

1. Pneumonia - Originally diagnosed based on fever, elevated 
wbc, and chest x ray findings. Although final read of the cxr 
was more consistent with chf, the pulmonologists felt it was 
more consistent with PNA. He recieved 500mg IV levaquin in the 
ED, and then had vancomycin added to broaden his covereage. He 
was admitted to the MICU, but did not require intubation or 
BiPap. He did well and was called out in less than 48 hours. No 
sputum or blood cultures returned positive. The patient 
continued to have some respiratory difficulties on the floor and 
had vancomycin restarted. He was dialyzed for volume overload. 
He continued to have an oxygen requirement and worsening 
delirium. Given his overall worsening status, his multiple 
cormorbidities, and his poor quality of life at home, the 
decision was made to make the patient comfort measures. This 
decision was reached by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3135**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the 
patient's wife and family. Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7370**] passed away on [**2696-6-15**] 
at 6:15 am.

2. Delirium- patient was agitated in the setting of hypoxia and 
illness. He initially required sedation with haldol until his 
clinical condition improved. These medications were tapered off, 
but he became increasing more agitated and restless. They were 
reinstituted. A source of delirium was done with UA, cxr, 
telemetry, cardiac enzymes, electrolytes, Head CT. These were 
all remarkable. No source was clearly found and it was thought 
to be multifactorial.

3. ESRD - Patient was seen by renal. He underwent hemodialysis. 
Following the patient's worsening clinical and mental status, 
the decision was made to stop dialysis and make the patient 
comfort care.

4. Vision problems: patient had long history of difficulty with 
his vision. He had known cataracts and ischemic optic 
neuropathy. During his hospitalization, he noted lack of vision 
in his right eye. This occurrred in the setting of delirium. The 
true nature of his symptoms could not be determined. 
Opthalmology was consulted and did not find any new lesions or 
ischemic changes in the eye.

1) Metoprolol Succinate 50 mg PO DAILY     
2) Lisinopril 10 mg PO DAILY
