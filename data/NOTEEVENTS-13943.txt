Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2141**] 
Chief Complaint:
tx from [**Hospital 508**] Hospital for resp failure  

 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None 
 
History of Present Illness:
51 yo m with h/o IPF was in USOH at home until 7 days PTA when 
he developed inc brown sptum, SOB, and chills. Developed 
diarrhea 3 days PTA. last few days SOB got worse. During the 
last few days, his pulm increased steroids ans stated on a 
Zpack. Over the next day, had decreased eating and inc weakness. 
He is normally on 1.5 L NC O2 at home since his DC from [**2-15**].  
Wife called EMS at midnight of 4/8. who brought him to [**Hospital 508**] 
Hosp ED. EMS was unable to obtain an O2 sat and placed him on 
NRB. On presentation to the ED, his O2 sat was 55% on arrival 
and then 79% on NRB. ABG pn NRB was 7.44/27/72. He was given 
tylenol, ativen, rochephin, solumedrol 125 IV, Bactrim, flagyl, 
and azithro in the ED. Was intubated in the ICU at [**Hospital1 508**] at 
0245. While intubated, becamse hypotensive and was started on 
neo and given fluids. Was switched to levophed and vasopression 
in the ICU. BP reported at 60's systolic. Under sterile 
conditions, placed L IJ and L art groin line [**3-12**] him being 
clamped down. Gave aggressive IVF (4L). CVP went from 10 -> 30 
with fluids. ABG after intubation 7.05/40/86 on AC 
500/30/10/100. He was noted to have WBC of 29 with 8% bands and 
given ceftax, vanc, flagyl (?cdiff) in the ICU. Also wanted to 
give bactrim for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 5552**] did not get b/f transfer. Got a DFA 
for flu which is neg. Also noted to be in ARF with Cr 2.1. Also 
got bicarb gtt and stress dose steroids. MD [**MD Number **] was Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  

.  
Transfered via medflight to [**Hospital1 19**]. On route, required vecuronium 
an fentanyl bolus. Stopped propofol for hypotension. On 
presentation to the ICU, gas was 6.98/66/84 on AC 500/18/13/100. 
Was on levophed and vasopression and bicarb gtt.  
 
Past Medical History:
1. NIDDM  
2. HTN  
3. Intersitial pulm fibrosis - Starting in 9/06, the patietn 
started to have some SOB. Admitted to OSH [**1-13**] and CT showed 
pulm infilatrates and honeycoming. VATs-bx at [**Hospital 508**] hosp showed 
diffuse aveolar damage. Felt to have rapidly accerleating IPF. 
That admission was started on steroids and went into rehab. DC 
from rehab in 1/07 on 1.5 L home O2. on a VERY slow pred taper.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2860-5-16**] 6:50 PM
Slight worsening of bilateral interstitial/alveolar opacities 
bilaterally, which may represent pulmonary edema.
.
[**2860-5-16**] EKG
Sinus tachycardia. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2860-5-16**] 
the T wave 
inversions in the inferior leads are slightly more prominent.  
.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 51 yo m with h/o IPF dx at [**Hospital 508**] hospital in 12/06 
here with septic shock and acute resp failure who expired 
shortly after presentation to the hospital given profound shock. 

.  
# Resp failure: Most likley [**3-12**] to acceleration of IPF. Was on 
steroids with a long taper and no PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1885**] that can be 
ascertained from records we have. Therefore, at increased risk 
for pathogens such as PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 9868**], [**Name11 (NameIs) **], Aspergillus, 
coccidioidomycosis, and nocardia, given his immunocompromised 
state. Diagnostics:  
sputum cultures, viral screen, U leg antigen. Considered bronch 
but unable to decrease FiO2. Family was to bring the path slides 
and CT scans from [**Hospital1 508**] hosptial pathology and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 338**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] 
will review them to give second opnion on diagnosis of IPF. 
Theraputics: continued abx which included cefepime for gram pos 
and pseudomonas coverage; azithro for leginella and mycoplasma 
coverage; Vanc by level for MRSA (no history of MRSA); bactrim 
for PCP and nocardia. Ventilation and oxygenation: esopheal 
balloon to measure trans plumonary pressures. Pt with high chest 
wall compliance, but very low lung compliance. Continued on PCV 
to limit peak pressures, need to limit PEEP as well. was 
initially having very low sats on 100% Fio2 and 13 PEEP. 
Attempted to wean FiO2.  
.  
# Septic Shock: Most concerning for pulmonary etiology. Pan 
culture and f/u OSH cultures. Broad spectrum abx. Stress dose 
steroids. Attempted to keep CVP > 20 given high PEEP. Monitored 
UO which slowly decreased to anuria at time of demise.   
Continued levophed and vasopressin.  
.  
# Gap metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis: was on bicarb 
gtt for most of the day. Elevated lactate, which continued to 
trend up until the patients demise.  
.  
# DM: insulin gtt  
.  
# ARF: Cr 2.1 on presentation. No h/o renal failure. could be 
related to sepsis, volume depletion. Fluid repletion, but 
patient with lactic acidosis, renal failure, anuric at time of 
demise.   
.  
# Coagulopathy: Concerning for DIC. D-dimer high and INR 
increasing. PE lower on differential since has clear infectious 
signs and labs. Avoided heparin.
.  
# Diarrhea, has a h/o ciff in the past and has had 3 days 
diarrhea since starting zpack. Flagyl emperically. c-diff toxin 
was to be checked x3  
.  
# HTN: Held HCTZ while in shock  
# Hyperchol: Held statin while has shock liver  
# FEN: NPO, bolus for low UO   
.
# Communication/Code: had family discussion on [**5-16**] about 
expectations. Told family that his IPF is a terminal disease and 
that his chance of making it though this illness is very low. 
The family was unaware of the severity of the diagnosis and its 
natural progression for unclear reasons. The patient did not 
share much of his medical history with the family. Of note, he 
told his wife that he did not want to go to the hospital though 
he had been very ill for the last few days. The outcome of the 
meeting was to proceed with very aggressive care for the next 48 
hours and then reassess his status if it has not improved for 
withdrawl of care. Unfortunately pt's condition continued to 
deteriorate. 11:30 PM [**2860-5-17**], in discussion with the family 
members- decision was made that no chest compressions, or shocks 
would be delivered in the event of cardiac arrest. The 
implications of this decision were discussed in detail and 
decision was confirmed. No chest compressions, defibrillation 
etc to be delivered to the patient in the event of code. Family 
would like abx, fluids, pressors and other aggressive measures 
to be continued at this time. Soon therafter patient became 
bradycardic, overwhleming acidosis, renal failure and shock, and 
pt expired with family by his side.
