Service:  NEONATOLOGY
week gestation male infant born at 0118 this morning.
The nurse midwife following the pregnancy was [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 840**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2854**],
obstetrician Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2855**], maternal fetal medicine
consultant Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2856**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2857**].
PREGNANCY:  The mother is 39 years old, gravida IV and para
She has a 21, 18 and 11 year old who are all healthy.

PRENATAL SCREENS:  The mother is O positive, antibody screen
negative, hepatitis surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive
and rubella immune.
The pregnancy was uncomplicated until last week on [**3248-10-28**],
when the mother was referred to the [**Hospital1 **]
Ultrasound performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2856**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2857**] revealed findings of
massive polyhydramnios, a small thoracic cavity, normal
heart, normal kidneys, micrognathia, short long bones upper
and lower extremities.  The patient was given diagnosis of
probable skeletal dysplasia, dwarfism, and advised this might
be a lethal condition.  Arrangements were made for further
diagnostic testing at [**Hospital1 4**]
and consultation at [**Hospital3 27**] on Tuesday, [**3248-11-3**].

LABOR AND DELIVERY:  The mother developed spontaneous labor
late last night and on admission to Labor and Delivery was
found to be eight centimeters dilated in active labor.
Delivery was by normal spontaneous vaginal route.  The baby
emerged with decreased tone, no respiratory effort, heart
rate was approximately 80.  The baby was treated with bulb
suctioning,  stimulation, bag and mask ventilation and then
intubation with a 2.5 endotracheal tube.  Intubation was
difficult secondary to micrognathia and anterior placed
airway.  Apgar scores were three, four, six and six.  The
baby was noted immediately to have multiple dysmorphic
features including short limbs, very small thoracic cavity
and prominent abdomen.

NEONATAL COURSE:  The baby was admitted to the NICU for
further treatment and evaluation.  Chest x-ray and clinical
course were consistent with pulmonary hypoplasia.

On physical examination, weight was 1500 grams (80th
percentile), length 37 centimeters (30th percentile), head
circumference 27.5 centimeters (50th percentile).  Vital
signs revealed temperature 97, heart rate 144, blood pressure
70/38 with a mean of 52, oxygen saturation 40% in 100% FIO2.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - The anterior fontanelle
was soft and flat.  Eyes with question of cloudy corneas.
The pupils were nonreactive with midfull dilatation.  Small
mouth was noted.  The palate was intact.  Prominent
micrognathia was noted.  The ears were noted to be low set.
Respiratory examination - The thoracic cavity was very small.
Air entry was only fair with equal but very coarse tight
breath sounds bilaterally.  Cardiovascular - No murmur was
noted.  S1 and S2 normal. Perfusion was poor.  Abdominal
examination revealed moderately distended abdomen, no clear
fluid shift. Genitourinary examination revealed normal male
genitalia with testes palpable in the scrotum bilaterally.
Neurologic examination - The tone was diffusely decreased but
spontaneous movements were noted in the upper and lower
extremities.

DIAGNOSTIC WORKUP:  Chest x-ray revealed endotracheal tube in
appropriate position.  The lungs were very small volumes with
dense hazy lung fields.  The heart size was within normal limits,
normal situs was noted, no air leak noted.  The ribs were
noted to be shortened.  Long bones very disorganized with
crumpled appearance.

LABORATORY DATA:  Complete blood count revealed white blood
cell count 12.4, differential 11% polys, 1% bands, 74%
lymphocytes, 248,000 nucleated red blood cells, hematocrit
55.0%, platelet count 111,000.  Arterial blood gas was pH
6.69, pCO2 165, pO2 43 on high frequency oscillator
ventilator with pressure of 20 and amplitude of 35 and FIO2
of 100%.

DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT:  This is a 29 week gestation preterm
male infant with multiple congenital abnormalities consistent
with skeletal dysplasia, possible diagnosis of osteogenesis
imperfecta.  Genetics from [**Hospital3 27**] was consulted
and evaluated the baby fully prior to his death.  Blood was
sent for chromosomes.  DNA extraction and a skin biopsy was
performed for collagen studies.

After discussion with the parents regarding the baby's
status, severe pulmonary hypoplasia being incompatible with
survival, decision was made to withdraw further support.
The baby was held by both parents and the baby's older
sister.  The baby was pronounced at 3:42 a.m.  The parents
gave consent for a full autopsy and this will be performed at
[**Hospital3 27**].  Follow-up will be arranged with
Genetics at [**Hospital3 27**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 935**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 306**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], Genetics, in two months and bereavement follow-up
will be arranged with myself, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], NNP, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 739**]

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Probable dwarfism.
     
     FINDINGS:  A single frontal view of the skull, single frontal view of the
     chest and upper extremities, and single frontal view of the pelvis and lower
     extremities was performed.  The visualized long bones, scapulae, clavicles,
     skull base, and iliac wings have a coarse irregular appearance.  Long bones
     appear hyperexpanded and sclerotic.  Findings are most likely related to some
     form of skeletal dysplasia, and less likely due to osteogenesis imperfecta,
     as the bones do not appear osteopenic. In particular, the spine is normal. The
     length of the long bones appears relatively normal with respect to the body.
     The thorax is small. Multiple irregular expanded ribs are identified. There is
     UAC, whose distal tip projects at the T11 level. Several gas filled loops of
     proximal small bowel are identified.

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Probable dwarfism.
     
     FINDINGS:  A single frontal portable view of the chest and abdomen was
     performed.  The thorax is small.  There is near complete opacification of both
     lungs.  The ET tube terminates in the upper thoracic trachea.  The ribs,
     scapulae, clavicles, iliac wings, and visualized long bones are abnormal
     demonstrating marked cortical irregularity and expansion.  The spine appears
     relatively normal.  There is gas within the stomach and several proximal loops
     of small bowel.
     
     Above findings likely represent a form of skeletal dysplasia rather than an
     unusual form of osteogenesis imperfecta.
