Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3152**] 
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central Venous Line Placement

 
History of Present Illness:
39 yo M with h/o cranial mass admitted to FICU for decreased 
responsiveness. Patient initially presented [**6-6**] after being 
found by roommate with decreased mental status in the setting of 
overtreatment with LBP with fentanyl patches. In the ED he was 
hypotensive to 79/52 which improved with 5L NS IVF and narcan 
but also was febrile to 101.2 so initially was treated with 2 gm 
CTX, 1 gm vanc and acyclovir. LP was normal but ABG was 
7.26/77/71 so he was started on a naloxone drip in the ED which 
was discontinued in the FICU for concern for narcotic 
withdrawal. Of note tox screen in ED was positive for cocaine as 
well.  On arrival to the FICU the patient was afebrile, 
normotensive, and 98% on room air. However he was exhibiting 
signs of narcotic withdrawal including abdominal pain and 
yawning. He also reported back pain. Still somewhat confused but 
appropriate, responsive to voice, and following commands. Denied 
fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, HA. 
.
He does not recall how he came to the hospital, but his last 
memory is using cocaine with a friend after being sober for 5 
years and next thing woke up in the ED. He states that he may 
have used 2x100mc fentanyl patches instead of his normal 50mcg 
and 100mcg as prescribed. He denies current chest pain, chest 
tightness, shortness of breath, focal weakness or loss of 
sensation. Currently he reports poorly controlled back pain in 
the cervical region [**11-12**], nonradiating deep inside his neck. He 
also feels nauseaous with no vomiting, has chronic diarrhea, and 
[**11-12**] abdominal pain as well. 

 
Past Medical History:
- Glioblastoma (not yet confirmed with hospital records): Gamma 
Knife therapy. Diagnosed 2 years ago, but not followed.  
-Chronic pancreatitis: reports he has had three attempted stent 
placements which had failed and has had pancreatitis throughout 
his life.  
-Left thumb amputation: 2-1/2 years ago after an IV infiltrated  

in his hand for 18 hours.  
-post appendectomy  
-post cholecystectomy  
-GI bleed due to an ulcer in [**3384**] (while on NSAIDs).  
-muliple obdominal tumors requiring resection of partial bowel, 
liver, and pancreas due to pseudocyst and tumor syndrome. He is 
followed by a Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9481**] in [**State 7234**].  
-Asthma  
-Recurrent PNA  

 
Social History:
The patient says that he has been sober for 5 years. He states  
that he smokes 8 cigarettes a day, and he used to smoke 3-1/2  
packs a day for 14 years. He states he has used marijuana. 
Denies IVDU.  

 
Family History:
Sister and father committed suicide. Mother died from MI and 
stroke. Paternal grandfather with history of ""brain and stomach 
cancer."" No diabetes in the family. 
 
Physical Exam:
T 98.3 HR 83 BP 90/74 RR 18 O2 At 95% [**Female First Name (un) **]  
Gen: sleeping comfortably but easily aroused  
HEENT-PERRL, MMM, edentulous, hairless scar on left occiput, 
neck supple  
Hrt-RRR, nS1S2 no MRG  
Lungs- Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  
Abd: soft, mild diffuse tenderness with negative stethascope 
press sign, NABS, midline scar, no HSM but difficult to assess 
as pt was distended  
Ext: no peripheral edema, Amputated left thumb.  

 
Pertinent Results:
[**3394-6-6**] CT HEAD: Pineal region mass measuring 18 x 11 mm with no 
focal mass effect. However, the study was limited since no IV 
contrast was used. Please note that MRI is the best modality for 
assessing intracarnial masses. No hemorrhage, mass effect or 
hydrocephalus. 
.
[**3394-6-6**] CXR: Bibasilar opacities left greater than right, likely 
represent aspiration.
.
[**3394-6-6**] ECG: Sinus rhythm, rate 99. Small Q waves are seen in the 
inferior leads. The electrocardiogram is otherwise, normal. No 
previous tracing available for comparison.  
.
[**3394-6-7**] CXR: Previous left lobe atelectasis has cleared. 
Pulmonary vascular congestion suggests volume overload or 
borderline cardiac decompensation although heart is normal size. 
This may also explain hilar enlargement. Very small right 
pleural effusion is new or newly apparent. There are no findings 
to suggest pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Mental status change: Pt back to normal mental status and 
likely due to cocaine and fentanyl overuse. Fever resolved and 
may have been related to cocaine use.
There was an initial question of whether this was a suicide 
attempt and patient was placed on 1:1 sitter. He was 
subsequently reevaluated after leaving ICU and adamantly denied 
any SI or suicide attempts. Psychiatry cleared him at this time. 
An attempt was made to verify this with his roommate but he 
could not be reached.
.  
# Fever:-No infiltrate on CXR and no clear source of infection 
at this time. Only localizing symptom is pain in cervical spine. 
However he reports back pain for the last 6-7 years. Had no 
focal neurologic signs. It was recommended to him that he follow 
up with his PCP here or in [**State 7234**] to have an MRI of his spine 
to evaluate this chronic back pain. 
.
#Anemia-Pt anemic with elevated MCV concerning for EtOH although 
he denies. 
B12, folate, Fe studies wnl.
.  
# Polysubstance abuse: When patient was initially interviewed on 
the floor he denied ever having any medication/narcotic 
prescriptions filled in Massachussetts since moving here in 
January. However after calling several pharmacies it became 
clear he has had multiple narcotic prescriptions filled by 
several different providers at several different pharmacies. The 
patient was told that because of the concern that he has been 
abusing these medications and not using them safely that no new 
narcotic prescriptions could be given to him at discharge. He 
will need to follow up with a PCP and establish regular care and 
follow up. It is my recommendation that this patient not be 
prescribed any narcotic medications unless he establishes 
regular medical care and we obtain his medical records from 
[**State 7234**].

.  
# Aspiration: Suspected aspiration on admission given fever and 
elevated WBC in setting of narcotics overdose. To complete 
course of augmentin.

# Brain Tumor: appears to be meningioma. No need to get MRI as 
inpt but would benefit from follow-up as oupt. Mass is 
extraaxial making it not a GBM although unclear why he would get 
gamma knife for a meningioma. Needs to follow up with PCP.
.

     INDICATION:  39-year-old man with history of brain tumor.
     
     No comparison is available.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     There is isointense mass in the pineal measuring 11 x 18 mm.  This is best
     seen on series 2A, image 14.  There is no evidence of mass effect,
     hydrocephalus, or shift of normal midline structure.  No intracranial
     hemorrhage or major minor vascular territorial infarct is detected.  The
     density values of brain parenchyma is within normal limits.  The [**Doctor Last Name 63**]-white
     matter differentiation is well preserved.
     
     Bone windows do not demonstrate any fracture.  The visualized portion of the
     right maxillary sinus and sphenoid sinuses are unremarkable.  Both ethmoid
     sinuses demonstrate submucosal thickening.  The left maxillary sinus is small.
     This appearance might be developmental or might be due to sinus surgery.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Pineal region mass measuring 18 x 11 mm with no focal mass
     effect. However, the study was limited since no IV contrast was used.  Please
     note that MRI is the best modality for assessing intracarnial masses.
     
     No hemorrhage, mass effect or hydrocephalus.
