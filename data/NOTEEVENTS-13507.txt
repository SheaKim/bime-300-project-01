     PORTABLE AP CHEST:  Comparison is made to previous films from [**3035-11-16**] as
     well as earlier study from [**3035-11-15**].   The heart is upper limits of normal in
     size.  There is persistent pulmonary vascular engorgement and perihilar
     haziness.  Perihilar distribution of alveolar opacities is again demonstrated
     with relative sparing of the lung periphery.  Allowing for differences in
     technique and projection, this is slightly improved in the interval.
     
     IMPRESSION:   Slight improvement of perihilar alveolar pattern, most likely
     due to improving pulmonary edema.

     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The procedure was performed with Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 510**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 23**]
     who was present and supervising. The patient's left upper arm was prepped and
     draped in standard sterile fashion. After infusion of 1% lidocaine the left
     basilic vein was entered with a 21 gauge needle under ultrasonographic
     guidance. An .018 guidewire was advanced into the superior vena cava. Based on
     the markers on the guidewire it was determined that a length of 52 cm would be
     appropriate. The dual-lumen PICC line was cut to this length. The PICC line
     was advanced over 4 Fr introducer sheath. The wire and sheath were removed. A
     final chest x-ray demonstrated appropriate position of the PICC tip in the
     distal superior vena cava. The line was flushed and heplocked. It was secured
     with a StatLock. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no
     postprocedure complications.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of left 52 cm total length dual lumen PICC
     with tip in distal SVC. The line is ready for use.

     INDICATION: 55-year-old gentlemen with multiple medical problems requiring
     several medications and lab draws. Requires PICC line for access.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The procedure was performed with Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 510**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 23**]
     who was present and supervising. The patient's left upper arm was prepped and
     draped in standard sterile fashion. After infusion of 1% lidocaine the left
     basilic vein was entered with a 21 gauge needle under ultrasonographic
     guidance. An .018 guidewire was advanced into the superior vena cava. Based on
     the markers on the guidewire it was determined that a length of 52 cm would be
     appropriate. The dual-lumen PICC line was cut to this length. The PICC line
     was advanced over 4 Fr introducer sheath. The wire and sheath were removed. A
     final chest x-ray demonstrated appropriate position of the PICC tip in the
     distal superior vena cava. The line was flushed and heplocked. It was secured
     with a StatLock. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no
     postprocedure complications.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of left 52 cm total length dual lumen PICC
     with tip in distal SVC. The line is ready for use.

      Patient needs bilateral upper extremity vein mapping for future dialysis 
      fistula placement. Please assess both upper extremities and central veins.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  55 year old male requiring bilateral upper extremity vein mapping
     for hemodialysis access.
     
     On the right, there is sonographic evidence for either a duplicated right
     brachial artery or an early-arising right radial artery.  The cephalic vein is
     patent and measures 0.12 cm near the shoulder to 0.18 cm near the elbow.  The
     basilic vein is patent, measuring 0.40 cm near the shoulder and 0.32 cm near
     the elbow.
     
     On the left, there is a single left brachial artery.  The cephalic vein is
     patent, measuring from 0.14 cm near the shoulder to 0.20 cm near the elbow.
     There is relatively acute thrombus in the mid portion of the left basilic
     vein, extending into the left brachial vein.  The involved veins are
     relatively distended, suggesting the thrombus has formed recently.
     
     A right arm arteriogram could be performed in order to further evaluate the
     arterial anatomy.  Alternatively, the patient could be placed on
     anticoagulation in an attempt to recanalize the veins of the left upper
     extremity prior to fistula creation.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Duplicated right brachial artery, or high takeoff of the right radial
     artery. Patent right cephalic and basilic veins.
     
     2) Thrombus extending from the mid basilic vein into the brachial vein, which
     appears relatively new.  Left cephalic vein widely patent.  Single left
     brachial artery.

     INDICATION:  Renal failure needing urgent dialysis. Place dialysis catheter.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS PERFORMING PROCEDURE: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 522**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 250**], staff
     radiologist, was present throughout the entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE: Informed consent was obtained. through an anesthesized
     skin approach the right internal jugular vein was accessed with the
     micropuncture set using ultrasound guidance. The micropuncture wire was
     advanced into the distal superior vena cava. The puncture needle was then
     exchanged for the inner dilator wire with micropuncture set. Attention was
     then focused on the tunnel track. The track was anesthesized with 1%
     Lidocaine. The tunneled entrance site was sized and the catheter was tunneled
     in a antegrade fashion to the right IJ puncture site.  The inner dilator wire
     were then exchanged for dilators to accomodate 14.5 peelaway sheath. The inner
     dilator wire was removed and the tunneled hemodialysis catheter advanced
     through the peelaway sheath. The peelaway sheath was removed. Excellent
     bidirectional flow with flush is seen in both ports. Post procedure X-ray
     confirmed good location with distal tip within right atrium. The catheter was
     secured to the skin with 0 silk and an opsite. The right IJ puncture site was
     closed with dermabond.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: None.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:  10 cc 1% Lidocaine.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of 23 cm tip to cuff right IJ tunneled
     hemodialysis catheter.

     MRI OF THE ABDOMEN DATED [**3036-2-15**].
     
     INDICATION:  The patient is a 55 year-old man with metastatic colon cancer.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2 weighted images were obtained prior to the
     administration of intravenous contrast.  Dynamic gadolinium enhanced 3D
     gradient-echo T1 weighted images were subsequently obtained.
     
     Comparison is made to prior MRI examinations dated [**3035-10-7**] and
     [**3035-7-6**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Innumerable, well-circumscribed hepatic lesions are seen which are
     predominantly hypointense on T2 weighted images and hyperintense on T2
     weighted images, and demonstrate significant contrast enhancement.  These
     findings are consistent with known metastatic disease.  In comparison to prior
     MRI scans, there are more lesions on the current examination, and the
     previously seen lesions are significantly larger in size.  Specifically, the
     largest lesion previously seen in segment 5 had significantly decreased in
     size between the prior two examinations going from approximately 1.7 x 1.4 mm
     in maximum transverse diameter down to 1.2 x 0.9 cm in diameter.  It has now
     increased to approximately 1.8 x 1.5 cm.  Another lesion in segment 4 has
     grown from approximately 8 mm x 7 mm on [**3035-7-6**] to a current size of
     approximately 13 mm x 13 mm.
     
     There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  The
     portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow.  The hepatic veins are patent.
     The gallbladder is within normal limits in size without evidence of filling
     defects.  The spleen and pancreas appear within normal limits.  The kidneys
     demonstrate unusually high T1 weighted signal intensity in the renal pyramids
     diffusely bilaterally.  This is non-specific in appearance, however likely
     relates to history of renal failure.  No enhancing renal masses are seen.  The
     adrenal glands appear within normal limits.  A lymph node measuring 1.8 x 1.5
     cm in transverse diameter is seen in the aortocaval space.  No other enlarged
     lymph nodes are seen.  The visualized bone marrow demonstrates normal signal
     intensity on all pulse sequences.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Increased number and size of hepatic metastases, as described
     above.  Enlarged aortocaval lymph node.
                                                                 (Over)

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  55-year-old male with endstage renal disease and left AV graft
     with symptoms of steal.  Status post revision in 3/04.  Patient with recurrent
     symptoms of steal phenomenon.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 128**] [**Name (STitle) 84**] and Dr.
     [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 526**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 85**], the attending physician.  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 527**]. [**First Name (STitle) 85**] was present and supervising
     during the entire procedure.  Informed and signed consent was obtained.  The
     right groin was prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion.  Access to
     the right common femoral artery was obtained using a micropuncture needle.  A
     0.035 [**Last Name (un) 528**] wire was then advanced into the abdominal aorta and
     micropuncture needle was exchanged for a 5 French sheath.  A 5 French
     headhunter catheter was then used to gain access to the proximal aortic arch.
     At this point an arch aortogram was performed.  Subsequently, the catheter was
     advanced into the proximal left subclavian artery over the guidewire and an
     angiogram of the left upper extremity was then performed.  At this point, the
     0.035 [**Last Name (un) 528**] wire was then advanced to the left brachial artery and a third
     angiogram of the distal left upper extremity was then performed.  The
     catheters were then removed and hemostasis was achieved.  The patient
     tolerated the procedure well with no immediate post procedure complications.
     
     MEDICATIONS/CONTRAST:  130 cc of Optiray 320.  Local anesthetic with 1%
     lidocaine.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     FINDINGS:  A single view of the aortic arch demonstrates a widely patent
     e thoracic aorta, proximal brachiocephalic artery, left common carotid artery,
     and left subclavian artery.  There is early filling of the left subclavian
     vein, a finding that is consistent with the patient's history of an AV fistula
     graft.  A right sided central line is in place with its distal tip in the SVC.
     
     An angiogram of the left upper extremity shows a patent left subclavian artery
                                                                 (Over)

     and left axillary artery.  The left brachial artery demonstrates preferential
     flow to the patient's AV graft.  This preferential flow results in brisk flow
     to the veins proximal to the graft site. Concentric narrowing is present
     within the graft which reflects the patient's recently placed surgical
     constriction device.
     
     Antegrade flow is seen within the ulnar artery and radial artery; however,
     there is relatively reduced flow within the left radial artery. The ulnar
     artery fills the superficial palmar arch.  The left radial artery does not
     extend beyond the wrist.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Patent AV fistula graft with preferential flow of arterial blood supply of the
     brachial artery to the AV graft and the proximal veins. The ulnar artery is
     patent, extending to the palmar arch; however, the radial artery demonstrates
     reduced antegrade flow to the region of the left wrist.  Given the rapid
     preferential flow through the AV graft into the proximal veins from the right
     brachial artery, this finding could reflect the presence of a steal phenomenon
     within the distal left radial artery.

     e thoracic aorta, proximal brachiocephalic artery, left common carotid artery,
     and left subclavian artery.  There is early filling of the left subclavian
     vein, a finding that is consistent with the patient's history of an AV fistula
     graft.  A right sided central line is in place with its distal tip in the SVC.
     
     An angiogram of the left upper extremity shows a patent left subclavian artery
                                                                 (Over)

     and left axillary artery.  The left brachial artery demonstrates preferential
     flow to the patient's AV graft.  This preferential flow results in brisk flow
     to the veins proximal to the graft site. Concentric narrowing is present
     within the graft which reflects the patient's recently placed surgical
     constriction device.
     
     Antegrade flow is seen within the ulnar artery and radial artery; however,
     there is relatively reduced flow within the left radial artery. The ulnar
     artery fills the superficial palmar arch.  The left radial artery does not
     extend beyond the wrist.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Patent AV fistula graft with preferential flow of arterial blood supply of the
     brachial artery to the AV graft and the proximal veins. The ulnar artery is
     patent, extending to the palmar arch; however, the radial artery demonstrates
     reduced antegrade flow to the region of the left wrist.  Given the rapid
     preferential flow through the AV graft into the proximal veins from the right
     brachial artery, this finding could reflect the presence of a steal phenomenon
     within the distal left radial artery.

     HISTORY:  Fifty-five year old male with h/o 3 vessel CAD, s/p angioplasty of the
     left circumflex.
     
     SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB:
     
     Dipyridamole was infused intravenously over 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142  
     mg/kg/min.  Two minutes after the cessation of infusion, Tc-99m sestamibi was
     administered IV.  There were no anginal symptoms or ST changes.
     
     INTERPRETATION: 
     
     Imaging Protocol: gated SPECT.
     
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tl-201.
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.
     
     Stress images show a moderate perfusion defect of the inferior wall which
     partially resolves on resting images.  
     Ejection fraction calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after
     Dipyridamole administration is 51%, with normal wall motion.
     
     In comparison to the prior study from [**3035-5-29**], the inferior wall defect is less
     severe.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Moderate, partially reversible inferior wall defect, with EF 51%.

     TECHNIQUE:   Multiplanar T1, T2, STIR and TOF images were obtained through the
     abdomen.  Axial VIBE images were obtained pre/post administration of 20 cc
     Gadolinium. Multiplanar reformations were performed.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3035-10-7**] and [**3036-4-12**].
     
     MR ABDOMEN WITHOUT/WITH CONTRAST:  There are multiple enhancing lesions
     identified throughout the liver.  Many of these lesions have slightly
     increased in size in the interval.  No definite new lesions are present. There
     is normal hepatopetal flow in the main portal vein.  There is no significant
     ductal dilatation.  On T1 weighted images, there is reversal of the normal
     signal pattern of both kidneys, with high signal present within the pyramids.
     This is not significantly changed from the prior studies and may relate to
     acute tubular necrosis or renal failure.  The pancreas, adrenal glands and
     gallbladder are unremarkable.  There has been no other significant interval

     There is a small-to-moderate amount of fluid in the subacromial-subdeltoid
     bursa, with complex T2 signal intensity.  There is linear high T2 signal
     dissecting across the distal portion of the supraspinatus tendon (series 5,
     image 7, and series 6, image 7), suspicious for a very thin tear. The
     differential would include a vessel traversing the tendon.  There is minimal
     degenerative signal in the infraspinatus tendon.  There is also degenerative
     signal in the subscapularis tendon.  There is mild atrophy of the teres minor
     muscle.  No mass is detected in the axillary recess. There is degenerative
     signal in the intra-articular portion of the biceps.
     
     There is moderately severe AC joint arthropathy. There is no frank
     glenohumeral joint effusion, though there is effacement of the fat along the
     anterior capsule of the glenohumeral joint, which typically reflects the

     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     MR OF THE CERVICAL SPINE:
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted, inversion recovery, and axial
     gradient echo images of the cervical spine were performed.
     
     FINDINGS:  The alignment of the cervicovertebral bodies is normal without
     evidence of listhesis.  The height of the vertebral bodies is preserved. There
     are endplate signal abnormalities noted consistent with degenerative change at
     multiple mid-cervical vertebral body levels.  Additionally, there is loss of
     intervertebral disc height with evidence of disc dissecation at C3-4, C4-5,
     C5-6, and C6-7.  Additionally, the bony central spinal canal is small, which
     may be secondary to congenitally small pedicles.  No signal abnormalities are
     identified within the vertebral bodies to suggest metastatic disease.  No
     areas of abnormal signal are demonstrated on the inversion recovery sequences.
     
     At the C3-4 level, there is a bulging disc with posterior osteophytes present
     as well as thickening of the ligamentum flavum, all of which cause moderate to
     severe central canal stenosis.  Additionally, there is increased T2 signal
     within the cervical spinal cord centrally at this level, suggestive of edema.
     The neural foramina bilaterally are difficult to assess, but there is likely
     moderate to severe stenosis bilaterally.
     
     At the C4-5 level, there is a bulging disc and posterior osteophyte formation
     as well as thickening of the ligamentum flavum, all of which cause moderate to
     severe central canal stenosis and likely moderate to severe bilateral neural
     foraminal narrowing.
     
     At the C5-6 level, there is a small bulging disease present and mild
     thickening of the ligamentum flavum.  There is mild to moderate central canal
     stenosis and mild narrowing of both neural foramina.
     
     At the C6-7 level, there is a bulging disc with posterior osteophyte formation
     and thickening of the ligamentum flavum, findings all causing moderate central
     canal stenosis.  Neural foramina are not well assessed at this level.
     
     At the C7-T1 level, there is too much artifact present to fully evaluate this
     level.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     As noted above, there is a focus of T2 signal hyperintensity within the
     central spinal cord at the C3-4 level, likely secondary to severe spinal
     stenosis at this level.  No other signal abnormalities are identified within
     the spinal cord or within the foramen magnum.  No prevertebral soft tissue
     abnormalities are demonstrated.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Congenitally small bony cervical central canal with moderate to severe
     central canal stenosis at multiple levels.  The most marked findings are
     present at the C3-4 level with evidence of T2 hyperintensity within the
     central spinal cord suggestive of of edema.
     2.  No evidence of metastatic disease.
     
     MRI OF THE THORACIC SPINE WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted, STIR, and axial T2-weighted
     images of the thoracic spine were performed without IV contrast.
     
     FINDINGS:  The alignment of the thoracic vertebral bodies is normal without
     evidence of listhesis.  Mild endplate signal abnormalities are noted within
     the mid-thoracic vertebral levels consistent with mild degenerative change.
     Otherwise, there are no signal abnormalities present within the vertebral
     bodies or discs stomach indicate metastatic disease.  There is no evidence of
     disc herniation, central canal stenosis, or neural foraminal narrowing
     bilaterally.  No paraspinal masses are identified.  No central canal masses
     are seen.  The signal intensity of the spinal cord is difficult to evaluate
     secondary to artifact.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of metastatic disease within the thoracic spine.

     INDICATION:  Metastatic colon cancer with bilateral shoulder pain.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     MR OF THE CERVICAL SPINE:
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted, inversion recovery, and axial
     gradient echo images of the cervical spine were performed.
     
     FINDINGS:  The alignment of the cervicovertebral bodies is normal without
     evidence of listhesis.  The height of the vertebral bodies is preserved. There
     are endplate signal abnormalities noted consistent with degenerative change at
     multiple mid-cervical vertebral body levels.  Additionally, there is loss of
     intervertebral disc height with evidence of disc dissecation at C3-4, C4-5,
     C5-6, and C6-7.  Additionally, the bony central spinal canal is small, which
     may be secondary to congenitally small pedicles.  No signal abnormalities are
     identified within the vertebral bodies to suggest metastatic disease.  No
     areas of abnormal signal are demonstrated on the inversion recovery sequences.
     
     At the C3-4 level, there is a bulging disc with posterior osteophytes present
     as well as thickening of the ligamentum flavum, all of which cause moderate to
     severe central canal stenosis.  Additionally, there is increased T2 signal
     within the cervical spinal cord centrally at this level, suggestive of edema.
     The neural foramina bilaterally are difficult to assess, but there is likely
     moderate to severe stenosis bilaterally.
     
     At the C4-5 level, there is a bulging disc and posterior osteophyte formation
     as well as thickening of the ligamentum flavum, all of which cause moderate to
     severe central canal stenosis and likely moderate to severe bilateral neural
     foraminal narrowing.
     
     At the C5-6 level, there is a small bulging disease present and mild
     thickening of the ligamentum flavum.  There is mild to moderate central canal
     stenosis and mild narrowing of both neural foramina.
     
     At the C6-7 level, there is a bulging disc with posterior osteophyte formation
     and thickening of the ligamentum flavum, findings all causing moderate central
     canal stenosis.  Neural foramina are not well assessed at this level.
     
     At the C7-T1 level, there is too much artifact present to fully evaluate this
     level.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     As noted above, there is a focus of T2 signal hyperintensity within the
     central spinal cord at the C3-4 level, likely secondary to severe spinal
     stenosis at this level.  No other signal abnormalities are identified within
     the spinal cord or within the foramen magnum.  No prevertebral soft tissue
     abnormalities are demonstrated.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Congenitally small bony cervical central canal with moderate to severe
     central canal stenosis at multiple levels.  The most marked findings are
     present at the C3-4 level with evidence of T2 hyperintensity within the
     central spinal cord suggestive of of edema.
     2.  No evidence of metastatic disease.
     
     MRI OF THE THORACIC SPINE WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted, STIR, and axial T2-weighted
     images of the thoracic spine were performed without IV contrast.
     
     FINDINGS:  The alignment of the thoracic vertebral bodies is normal without
     evidence of listhesis.  Mild endplate signal abnormalities are noted within
     the mid-thoracic vertebral levels consistent with mild degenerative change.
     Otherwise, there are no signal abnormalities present within the vertebral
     bodies or discs stomach indicate metastatic disease.  There is no evidence of
     disc herniation, central canal stenosis, or neural foraminal narrowing
     bilaterally.  No paraspinal masses are identified.  No central canal masses
     are seen.  The signal intensity of the spinal cord is difficult to evaluate
     secondary to artifact.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of metastatic disease within the thoracic spine.

     HISTORY: Right upper extremity swelling, history of DVT and stenosis on recent
     venogram.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Written informed consent was obtained following discussion of the
     risks and benefits with the patient.  The patient was brought to the
     angiography suite.  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 249**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 85**]
     with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 85**], the attending radiograph, being present and supervising
     throughout.  The right arm was prepped and draped in stamdard sterile fashion.
     Local anesthesia was achieved by injection of approximately  3 cc of 1%
     Lidocaine.  Under real-time ultrasound guidance, the right brachial vein was
     accessed with a 21-gauge micro-puncture needle through which a 0.018 guide
     wire was advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the SVC.  The needle was
     exchanged for a 4-French micro-puncture sheath.  A venogram was then performed
     of the right upper extremity, upper arm and chest was performed for of the the
     continued heparin therapy.  These venograms demonstrate no further clot. There
     is again demonstrated a tight stenosis of the right brachiocephalic vein. Over
     a guide wire, the sheath was exchanged for a larger 7-French sheath which
     would be able to accommodate a 12 mm balloon catheter.  A mean pressure
     measurement of 20 mm of mercury was obtained in the right upper extremity
     proximal to the area of stenosis using the 7-French Introducer sheath.  A
     Cobra catheter was then advanced over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 555**] wire which was able to traverse
     the area of stenosis and enter the right atrium. A mean pressure measurement
     of 11 mm of mercury was obtained.  Given the focal area of stenosis with a
     significant pressure gradient, a balloon angioplasty was planned.  The [**Doctor Last Name 555**]
     wire was then advanced into the inferior vena cava.  The Cobra catheter was
     exchanged for a 12 mm balloon catheter.  The balloon was positioned to
     traverse the area of stenosis under continued fluoroscopic guidance.  Balloon
     angioplasty was then performed twice with inflation of the balloon up to 8
     atmospheres.  Fluoroscopic images during balloon angioplasty demonstrated
     significant improvement in the focal area of tight stenosis.  The [**Doctor Last Name 555**] wire
     was then removed.  Pressure measurements through the balloon catheter before
     and after pull-back through the area of stenosis demonstrated a gradient of
     only 1 mm of mercury, which is physiologic.  Following the procedure, a
     pressure measurement in the right upper extremity was found to be reduced to
     15 mm of mercury.  A final venogram was then performed to assess the prior
     area of stenosis which demonstrated a good angiographic result.  The
     angioplasty balloon was then removed.  The 7-French sheath was then removed
     and hemostasis was achieved.
     
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: Right upper extremity swelling, history of DVT and stenosis on recent
     venogram.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Written informed consent was obtained following discussion of the
     risks and benefits with the patient.  The patient was brought to the
     angiography suite.  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 249**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 85**]
     with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 85**], the attending radiograph, being present and supervising
     throughout.  The right arm was prepped and draped in stamdard sterile fashion.
     Local anesthesia was achieved by injection of approximately  3 cc of 1%
     Lidocaine.  Under real-time ultrasound guidance, the right brachial vein was
     accessed with a 21-gauge micro-puncture needle through which a 0.018 guide
     wire was advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the SVC.  The needle was
     exchanged for a 4-French micro-puncture sheath.  A venogram was then performed
     of the right upper extremity, upper arm and chest was performed for of the the
     continued heparin therapy.  These venograms demonstrate no further clot. There
     is again demonstrated a tight stenosis of the right brachiocephalic vein. Over
     a guide wire, the sheath was exchanged for a larger 7-French sheath which
     would be able to accommodate a 12 mm balloon catheter.  A mean pressure
     measurement of 20 mm of mercury was obtained in the right upper extremity
     proximal to the area of stenosis using the 7-French Introducer sheath.  A
     Cobra catheter was then advanced over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 555**] wire which was able to traverse
     the area of stenosis and enter the right atrium. A mean pressure measurement
     of 11 mm of mercury was obtained.  Given the focal area of stenosis with a
     significant pressure gradient, a balloon angioplasty was planned.  The [**Doctor Last Name 555**]
     wire was then advanced into the inferior vena cava.  The Cobra catheter was
     exchanged for a 12 mm balloon catheter.  The balloon was positioned to
     traverse the area of stenosis under continued fluoroscopic guidance.  Balloon
     angioplasty was then performed twice with inflation of the balloon up to 8
     atmospheres.  Fluoroscopic images during balloon angioplasty demonstrated
     significant improvement in the focal area of tight stenosis.  The [**Doctor Last Name 555**] wire
     was then removed.  Pressure measurements through the balloon catheter before
     and after pull-back through the area of stenosis demonstrated a gradient of
     only 1 mm of mercury, which is physiologic.  Following the procedure, a
     pressure measurement in the right upper extremity was found to be reduced to
     15 mm of mercury.  A final venogram was then performed to assess the prior
     area of stenosis which demonstrated a good angiographic result.  The
     angioplasty balloon was then removed.  The 7-French sheath was then removed
     and hemostasis was achieved.
     
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: Right upper extremity swelling, history of DVT and stenosis on recent
     venogram.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Written informed consent was obtained following discussion of the
     risks and benefits with the patient.  The patient was brought to the
     angiography suite.  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 249**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 85**]
     with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 85**], the attending radiograph, being present and supervising
     throughout.  The right arm was prepped and draped in stamdard sterile fashion.
     Local anesthesia was achieved by injection of approximately  3 cc of 1%
     Lidocaine.  Under real-time ultrasound guidance, the right brachial vein was
     accessed with a 21-gauge micro-puncture needle through which a 0.018 guide
     wire was advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the SVC.  The needle was
     exchanged for a 4-French micro-puncture sheath.  A venogram was then performed
     of the right upper extremity, upper arm and chest was performed for of the the
     continued heparin therapy.  These venograms demonstrate no further clot. There
     is again demonstrated a tight stenosis of the right brachiocephalic vein. Over
     a guide wire, the sheath was exchanged for a larger 7-French sheath which
     would be able to accommodate a 12 mm balloon catheter.  A mean pressure
     measurement of 20 mm of mercury was obtained in the right upper extremity
     proximal to the area of stenosis using the 7-French Introducer sheath.  A
     Cobra catheter was then advanced over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 555**] wire which was able to traverse
     the area of stenosis and enter the right atrium. A mean pressure measurement
     of 11 mm of mercury was obtained.  Given the focal area of stenosis with a
     significant pressure gradient, a balloon angioplasty was planned.  The [**Doctor Last Name 555**]
     wire was then advanced into the inferior vena cava.  The Cobra catheter was
     exchanged for a 12 mm balloon catheter.  The balloon was positioned to
     traverse the area of stenosis under continued fluoroscopic guidance.  Balloon
     angioplasty was then performed twice with inflation of the balloon up to 8
     atmospheres.  Fluoroscopic images during balloon angioplasty demonstrated
     significant improvement in the focal area of tight stenosis.  The [**Doctor Last Name 555**] wire
     was then removed.  Pressure measurements through the balloon catheter before
     and after pull-back through the area of stenosis demonstrated a gradient of
     only 1 mm of mercury, which is physiologic.  Following the procedure, a
     pressure measurement in the right upper extremity was found to be reduced to
     15 mm of mercury.  A final venogram was then performed to assess the prior
     area of stenosis which demonstrated a good angiographic result.  The
     angioplasty balloon was then removed.  The 7-French sheath was then removed
     and hemostasis was achieved.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Metastatic colon cancer, endstage renal disease, on hemodialysis,
     severe cervical spine stenosis; now with mental status changes.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the head were performed from the occiput to the
     vertex without intravenous contrast.
     
     COMPARISON:  Head MRI [**3035-10-25**].
     
     HEAD CT w/o CONTRAST:  There is no acute intra- or extraaxial hemorrhage.  The
     lateral ventricles are asymmetrical, with the left larger than the right. This
     asymmetry was seen on prior MRI.  There is low attenuation change in the
     periventricular white matter, consistent with chronic microvascular
     infarction.  There is a focus of low attenuation within the right superior
     parietal white matter adjacent to the right lateral ventricle, likely
     consistent with a chronic infarct.  No abnormalities in this region were seen
     on prior MRI.  There is no mass effect and no shift of normally midline
     structures.  The [**Doctor Last Name 63**]/white matter differentiation and basal cisterns are
     unremarkable.
     
     The osseous structures, mastoid air cells and visualized paranasal sinuses are
     unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION
     
     1.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
     
     2.  Low attenuation focus in the right parietal lobe adjacent to the right
         lateral ventricle.  Given that no abnormalities were seen in this region
         on prior MRI of [**3035-10-25**], this is likely consistent with an interval
         tissue loss of uncertain etiology.
     3. MRI with contrast is the ideal study to exclude metastatic focus.

     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MR acquisitions of the abdomen were acquired.  Axial
     T1W in/out-of-phase imaging, axial and coronal HASTE sequences, axial STIR
     images, and axial T1W fat-suppressed 3D gradient-echo sequences were acquired
     before and after administration of contrast.  Dynamic contrast-enhanced
     imaging was used to evaluate the liver.
     
     MULTIPLANAR REFORMATS:
     
     Multiplanar reformats generated and aided in evaluation of the liver disease.
     
     REPORT:
     
     Multiple discrete liver lesions are again identified throughout the liver
     parenchyma consistent with metastases.  Direct side-to-side comparison to
     previous examination was performed. The lesions appear to have increased in
     size.  For instance, a lesion in the dome of the liver, labeled Lesion 1,
     measures 18 x 14 mm.  This measured approximately 13 x 13 mm in [**3036-5-19**].  A
     further lesion, in the anterior segment of the right lobe of the liver,labeled
     Lesion 2, now measures 15 x 15 mm, where it previously measured 11 x 12 mm.  A
     further lesion in segment VI measured at  19 x 18 mm, increased from previous.
     A further lesions in the junction of Segments 5 & 6,now measuring 2.4 x 2cm,
     has also increased from previous.
     
     There is intra and extra biliary dilatation. There is some dependent material
      identified within the gallbladder, consistent with small stones or sludge. At
     the distal end of the CBD is identified a small intraluminal filling defect
     with a meniscus. The appearances are most consistent with a CBD stone. The
     appearances have not significantly changed from previous exam.
     
     There is unchanged paraaortic and aortocaval lymphadenopathy.
     
     There is again evidence of reversal of the normal signal intensities within
     the medulla of the kidneys bilaterally, consistent with tubular necrosis or
     chronic renal disease.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     The appearances are consistent with progressive tumor burden.

     [**3036-2-15**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MR acquisitions of the abdomen were acquired.  Axial
     T1W in/out-of-phase imaging, axial and coronal HASTE sequences, axial STIR
     images, and axial T1W fat-suppressed 3D gradient-echo sequences were acquired
     before and after administration of contrast.  Dynamic contrast-enhanced
     imaging was used to evaluate the liver.
     
     MULTIPLANAR REFORMATS:
     
     Multiplanar reformats generated and aided in evaluation of the liver disease.
     
     REPORT:
     
     Multiple discrete liver lesions are again identified throughout the liver
     parenchyma consistent with metastases.  Direct side-to-side comparison to
     previous examination was performed. The lesions appear to have increased in
     size.  For instance, a lesion in the dome of the liver, labeled Lesion 1,
     measures 18 x 14 mm.  This measured approximately 13 x 13 mm in [**3036-5-19**].  A
     further lesion, in the anterior segment of the right lobe of the liver,labeled
     Lesion 2, now measures 15 x 15 mm, where it previously measured 11 x 12 mm.  A
     further lesion in segment VI measured at  19 x 18 mm, increased from previous.
     A further lesions in the junction of Segments 5 & 6,now measuring 2.4 x 2cm,
     has also increased from previous.
     
     There is intra and extra biliary dilatation. There is some dependent material
      identified within the gallbladder, consistent with small stones or sludge. At
     the distal end of the CBD is identified a small intraluminal filling defect
     with a meniscus. The appearances are most consistent with a CBD stone. The
     appearances have not significantly changed from previous exam.
     
     There is unchanged paraaortic and aortocaval lymphadenopathy.
     
     There is again evidence of reversal of the normal signal intensities within
     the medulla of the kidneys bilaterally, consistent with tubular necrosis or
     chronic renal disease.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     The appearances are consistent with progressive tumor burden.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     PROCEDURE: CT head without contrast.
     
     INDICATION: Unsteady gait.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast CT of the head was performed. A large field of view was
     used due to the patient's extreme kyphosis.
     
     FINDINGS:  The study is slightly limited due to the artifact secondary to a
     large field of view used for the patient's severe kyphosis.  However, no
     definite intracranial hemorrhage is appreciated.  The ventricles and sulci are
     prominent for the patient's age, suggesting mild atrophy.  This appearance is
     unchanged since the prior exam of [**3036-8-13**].  No major vascular territorial
     infarction is seen.  Chronic lacunar infarctions in the left centrum semiovale
     and in the right corona radiata adjacent to the lateral ventricle are again
     noted and are unchanged.
     
     Minor mucosal thickening is seen within the maxillary sinuses.  No suspicious
     bone lesions are seen.
     
     IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.  No change from the
     previous exam of [**3036-8-13**].

     FINDINGS:  The gallbladder is normal in appearance without gallstones, wall
     edema, or pericholecystic fluid.  As noted on prior MRI exam of [**3036-10-21**], there
     are multiple foci of metastatic liver lesions, which are subtly appreciated on
     ultrasound examination, most notably within the posterior segment of the right
     lobe of the liver.  Some mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is noted,
     unchanged from recent MRI exam.  Also, the common bile duct is mildly dilated,
     measuring roughly 9 mm.  This too is unchanged from MRI examination.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Normal gallbladder without gallstones.  Metastatic liver lesions,
     somewhat more difficult to discern than on recent MRI examination.  Stable
     appearance to mild common bile duct and intrahepatic ductal dilatation.

     INDICATION:  56 y/o man with metastatic colon CA, presenting with lower
     extremity weakness over the last five weeks, now with falls x 3.  He also
     reports 1-2 episodes of bowel incontinence.  Evaluate for cord compression.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1W and T2W images were performed through the lumbar
     spine.  Axial T1 & T2W images were performed from L1 through S1.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3032-10-15**].
     
     MR OF THE L-SPINE WITH CONTRAST:  There is disc desiccation at all levels.
     There are endplate degenerative changes with hig signal on the T2W images and
     low signal on the T1W images at the L4-5 disc space.  There is diffusely low
     abnormal signal within the lumbar vertebral bodies without focal lesions.
     There are signal changes of the endplates of the L4-5 level consistent with
     degenerative changes.  There is normal alignment of the lumbar vertebral
     bodies.
     
     On the axial images at L3-4 there is mild facet hypertrophy without central
     canal narrowing.  There is mild right neural foraminal narrowing at this
     level.  At L4-5 there are diffuse disc bulge, facet hypertrophy and
     hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum with mild central canal narrowing.  There
     is no narrowing of the neural foramina. At L5-S1 there has been prior surgical
     change inovlving the left lamina of L5. There are a facet degenerative changes
     and difuse disc bulge. There is mild central canal narrowing and no neural
     foraminal narrowing. There is no significant change in the degeneative changes
     of the lumbar spine compared to [**3032-10-15**].  There is no evidence of
     central canal compromise. Incidental note is made of a fatty filum.  
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Degenerative changes in the lumbar spine, as described above.
     
     2. Diffuse abnormal signal within the vertebral bodies.
     
     3. The clinical concern is for cord compression; however, only the lumbar
     spine was imaged as requested.  If there is clinical concern for cord
     compression, perhaps imaging of the thoracic would also be helpful.
     
     These findings were called and discussed with the house staff caring for the
     patient at the time of the exam.
