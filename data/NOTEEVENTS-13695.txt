Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:  
This is a 79y/o M with h/o HTN, DM, recent CVA, chronic 
ventilatory failure, CRI on HD who presents with change in MS 
and febrile in the ED, admitted to MICU. 
.  
# Altered mental status: Ct scan with no evidence of new 
intracraneal bleeding. Patient febrile in the ED. High WBC. It 
was thought that it could have been a combination of 
hypotension, hypercapnia and infection. He was initially started 
on broad spectrum antibiotics. Despite having a profund 
limitation communicating given his neurological status, his 
mental changes seemed to improved initially. However later on 
during his course, his mental status deteriorated, being even 
less responsive.
.
#ID:
Patient febrile and with a high WBC on admission. After starting 
broad spectrum antibiotics-cefepime-vancomycin and flagyl(for 
initial concern of aspiration pneumonia), he responded 
clinically. Urine cx from Rehab showed gram negative rods >100K 
enterobacter cloacae. Urine Cx in house grew Citrobacter Freundi 
and his sputum grew Acinetobacter Baummani. Since there was no 
more evidence of gram positive infections, vancomycin was 
discontinued and cefepime was kept.
.  
# Fevers: in the ED, high WBC, possible pneumonia. Also possible 
source sinus infections given findings on intial CT (see summary 
in significant studies). He did not spike any fevers after being 
transfer to the MICU from the ED.
.  
# Resp: Patient was intermitentely switched from AC to Pressure 
support trials.
However, after
 Patient did well. Then trach mask trials were done. He 
tolerated this well, although he required PS overnight.
.  
# ESRD on hemodyalisis: Renal service was consulted and HD was 
continued.
.  
# CV:  
Rhythm: NSR, not tachycardic.  
.  
Pump: With trace of lower extremity edema. X ray suggested some 
pulmonary edema on admission. Despite this findings, he was 
supported with 40% FIO2 most of the time.
.  
CAD: On admission Ck low normal, MB not done. Troponin 0.44. It 
was more likely due to CRI. Second set 12 hours apart, showed no 
changes.
.  
s/p stroke: continue aspirin, statin, plavix  
.  
# Hypotension: per referral form. Intially concern for sepsis in 
the setting of fevers and high blood count. His BP medications 
were held on admission. Patient di dnot require pressors. His 
blood pressure remained stable and BP meds were restarted.
.  
#FEN: 
Tube feedings were started thorugh peg tube. On [**3372-9-20**], patient 
pulled out peg tube. Temporary foley was placed and on [**3372-9-23**], 

On [**3372-9-24**] after deterioration of his mental status and also of 
his blood pressure, goals of care were discussed with his HCP. 
It was decided to direct goals of care towards confort care. 
Patient passed away accompanied by his significant other.

     INDICATION:  Change in mental status.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast axial head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no evidence for intracranial hemorrhage.  The ventricles,
     sulci, and cisterns are within normal limits.  The head is tilted in the
     scanner.  [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is preserved.  Periventricular
     white matter hypodensities are the sequelae of chronic small vessel
     infarction.  Chronic lacunar infarct is present within the left corona
     radiata and putamen. There is atherosclerotic calcification of the cavernous
     carotid and distal vertebral arteries. There is a fluid opacification of the
     nasopharynx as well as partial opacification of the ethmoid sinuses.  The
     maxillary sinuses and sphenoid sinuses are clear.  The left mastoid air cells
     are poorly-pneumatized, and the right are opacified with fluid, mucus, or
     combination.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Fluid within the nasopharynx and opacification of the right mastoid air
     cells.
     2.  No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
     
     These findings were provided to the ED dashboard at the time of the study.

     INDICATION:  79-year-old man with change in mental status and fever.
     
     There are no prior studies for comparison.
     
     SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A tracheostomy tube is in appropriate position.  The
     heart size is within normal limits.  There are aortic calcifications.
     Bilateral perihilar haziness and bilateral small pleural effusions are
     consistent with mild congestive heart failure. Bibasilar linear opacities and
     a retrocardiac opacity are consistent with atelectasis, although aspiration
     pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There is an old right sixth posterior rib
     deformity.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Mild congestive heart failure and small bilateral pleural effusions.
     
     2.  Retrocardiac opacity and bibasilar linear opacities likely represent
     atelectasis or aspiration pneumonia.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      79 year old man with h/o CVA, chronic ventilatory failure, trache'd. Pulled out 
      his PEG tube. Now with new foley catheter in. Needs KUB with Gastrografin 
      through catheter

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  79-year-old man with history of CVA and chronic ventilatory failure
     who pulled out his PEG tube.  A Foley catheter has been placed.
     
     SUPINE ABDOMEN:  A small amount of contrast has been infused through the Foley
     catheter.  This demonstrates opacification of the stomach.  No extravasation
     of contrast is identified.  There is no evidence of obstruction or
     intraperitoneal free air.  Degenerative changes of the lumbar spine are noted.
     Osseous structures are otherwise unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Appropriate positioning of Foley catheter within the stomach.
