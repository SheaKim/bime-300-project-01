History of Present Illness:
74 y/o F with a h/o HTN, RA, hypercholesterolemia who presents 
from OSH for further w/u of R renal artery embolus and sigmoid 
diverticulosis with intramural abscess, and slurred speech. Pt. 
is delirious and is unable to relay a history; history is 
obtained from her daughter and EMS reports.  
.  
Per report she fell at home 3 days PTA. She does not remember 
the fall. She says that her friend found her beside the bed 
yesterday morning and called EMS. She reports L lower back pain 
since the fall. She reports that she has felt ""generally down 
and punk"" for several days, and that her speech has been ""heavy, 
thick and boozy"" for about 2 weeks. She denies numbness 
anywhere, has noticed generalized weakness but no focal 
weakness, denies dysphagia, word finding difficulties, bowel or 
bladder incontinence. She denies fevers, chills, N/V, abd pain, 
or dysuria at home.  
.  
Per EMS records they were called to pt's house on [**6-20**] at 18:00. 
Pt. was complaining of lower back pain and LUQ abd pain. Family 
reported to them that pt. fell 3 days ago, that she has been 
increasingly confused over the past few days, that her speech 
has been ""slightly slurred,"" and that she has had generalized 
weakness for several days.  
.  
Pt. was brought to an OSH, where head CT showed age-related 
atrophy but no infarcts. CT abd performed and showed R renal 
artery embolus and diverticulosis with chronic-appearing 
intramural abscess. CEs negative x 1, WBC Ct 18. Pt. received 
Clindamycin, transferred here for further w/u.  
.  
In the ED she underwent evaluation by the neurology, vascular 
surgery, and general surgery teams. CXR showed a hilar mass. 
Vascular surgery recommended medical management of renal embolus 
due to new finding of hilar [**Hospital3 **] surgery recommended 
antibiotics and NPO status to manage diverticular abscess. She 
received 1 mg of ativan in the ED, mucomyst, ASA, and 
levo/flagyl.  
.
ROS (per family): Pt is s/p fall 6 mos ago and experienced a 
vertebral fracture. Denies fever or chills. 10 pound weight loss

.  
CXR [**6-21**]: Right hilar mass, with associated airspace opacity 
within the right upper lobe. These findings are concerning for 
malignancy within the right hilum, and secondary 
post-obstructive pneumonia or consolidation. Further evaluation 
with a CT scan is recommended.  
.  
CT Pelvic [**6-21**]: 1. Tubular filling defect measuring 1.2 cm in 
proximal right renal artery with hypoperfusion of right kidney, 
most likely representing right renal artery emboli. Persistent 
non-perfusion areas seen in the right kidney on delayed images.  

2. Inflammatory changes in sigmoid colon with fat stranding, and 
1.3 cm fluid collection versus small abscess.  
3. Compression fracture of lower thoracic vertebra.  
4. Right hilar mass noted on chest x-ray was not imaged on this 
abdominal CTA.  
.  
Renal US [**6-21**]: 1. No hydronephrosis.  
2. The renal vein was difficult to assess.  
3. The resistive indices are slightly less within the right 
kidney compared to the left. Further evaluation with a CTA study 
is recommended.  
.
CAROTID U/S [**6-23**]: No plaque or wall thickening of either carotid 
artery. Diffuse low velocity seen b/l suggesting low cardiac 
output.  
.  
CHEST CT [**6-22**]: 1. A very large heterogeneous right hilar mass 
measuring 7 cm with multiple areas of central necrosis extending 
to the level of the thyroid with associated mediastinal 
adenopathy. The mass extends into the SVC as well as the right 
mainstem bronchus with a short segment demonstrating 50% 
occlusion. 2. Lack of perfusion of right kidney secondary to 
previously identified thrombus. 3. Multiple hypodensities in the 
liver, the largest representing a simple cyst, the smallest too 
small to characterize, but may also represent cysts. 4. 
Compression deformity of T9 of indeterminate age.  
.
Echo [**6-23**]: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal 
defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or 
saline contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thickness, 
cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to 
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no 
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There a moderate-sized 
(1.2 cm-thick) echogenic anterior space which most likely 
represents an epicardial fat pad, though a loculated, organized 
anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.  
.
L-spine film [**6-25**]: 1. Chronic-appearing L1 vertebral body 
compression fracture.  2. Likely small fusiform abdominal aortic 
aneurysm which was seen on the prior CTA abdomen of [**2820-6-21**].
.
FNA, Right supraclavicular lymph node [**6-25**]:  POSITIVE FOR 
MALIGNANT CELLS 
  consistent with non-small cell carcinoma. 
.
CT Head with Contrast [**6-27**]: Single focus of low density within 
the white matter of the right frontal lobe likely representing 
chronic microvascular infarct. No evidence of enhancing lesions 
to suggest metastatic disease.
.
CXR [**6-29**]: 1. Worsening right upper lobe post-obstructive 
pneumonia secondary to right hilar mass. Increased right lung 
volume loss.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions
.
RUQ US [**6-29**]: No evidence of acute cholecystitis.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9826**] is a 74 year old female with a history of HTN, RA, 
hypercholesterolemia, who presents from OSH for work up of R 
renal artery embolus and sigmoid diverticulosis with intramural 
abscess, delirum and slurred speech, now with hypercalcemia and 
likely nephrogenic DI.  Hospital course outlined by problem 
below:
.  
1. Right hilar mass - This was concerning for malignancy given 
history of tobacco and appearance on imaging.  The CT scan found 
a 7cm mass in the right lung which invades into the SVC and 
right mainstem bronchus.  Intervential pulmonology was consulted 
for possible stenting of right mainstem bronchus.  They did not 
feel it was necessary at the time.  Thoracic surgery was 
consulted for a fine needle aspiration of the supraclavicular 
node for diagnosis and to see if she was a surgical candidate.  
The FNA preliminarily showed malignant cells consistent with 
non-small cell carcinoma.  Hematology/oncology and radiation 
oncology were consulted and treatment options were discussed the 
with the patient and the family.  Outpatient appointments were 
established.  A bone scan was to be performed to look for bony 
mets on day of discharge, but this was discontinued secondary to 
a change in the patient's treatment goals (see below). On the 
last night of admission, the patient had an acute increased need 
for oxygen therapy (she was on room air prior).  A chest x-ray 
showed pulmonary effusions and a RUL infiltrate suggestive of 
post-obstructive pneumonia vs lobe collapse.  The patient 
remains afebrile but her WBC was elevated to 20K on discharge 
from 16K and 18K a fews days prior.  She was already receiving 
levofloxacin and metronidazole for the diverticular abscess, and 
she was given furosemide to help with the pleural effusions.  In 
a family discussion with the medical team, the patient and her 
daughter decided that no further aggressive treatment was 
wanted.  Hospice consult was placed per Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9826**]' request.  
Extensive conversations had been held with the patient and the 
daughter throughout her stay regarding her code status and 
wishes towards treatment and this decision is consistent with 
those prior conversations.
.
2. Hypercalcemia - The patient presented with delirium and 
slurred speech.  She was found to have hypercalcemia and 
hypernatremia which was thought to be a paraneoplastic syndrome. 
 Her PTHrp was found to be elevated at 8.6.  Her hypercalcemia 
was causatively linked to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.  Renal 
consult was placed and she was agressively treated with IVF, 
furosemide, calcitonin, and pamidronate to decrease her calcium 
levels.  She spent one night in the ICU mostly for nursing 
issues regarding her frequent lab checks and electrolyte 
monitoring.  Once they were within normal limits, her sodium 
levels dropped to normal range and she was no longer delirious.  

.  
3. Hypernatremia - secondary to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. 
See above.
.
4. Diverticulitis with localized abscess - surgery consult was 
obtained and they recommened conservative treatment given her 
comorbidities.  She was placed on levofloxacin and 
metronidazole.  She was initially NPO, but as her delirium 
resolved, surgery recommended normal diet.  She was cleared by a 
speech and swallow evaluation and placed on soft foods and thin 
liquids along with Boost supplementation per nutrition 
recommendations.
.
5. Right renal emboli - Normal renal function on admission but 
large renal artery emboli noted.  At first this was thought to 
be likely due to cholesterol emboli per the renal team given h/o 
hypercholesterolemia and did not require anticoagulation.  At 
discharge it was unclear whether this thrombus is secondary to 
cholesterol emboli or to her hypercoagulable state secondary to 
malignancy.  Her renal function is still within normal limits. 
.  
6. Leukocytosis - The patient's WBC was stable around 16K on 
levofloxacin and metronidazole for her diverticular abscess.  A 
few days prior to admission, her WBC rose to 18K, but she 
remained afebrile.  Work up showed no urinary tract infection 
(patient had foley cath in place for close monitoring of 
ins/outs for DI treatment) and a RUQ ultrasound showed no 
cholecystitis (patient had RUQ pain on exam on the day prior to 
discharge.  The chest x-ray the night prior to admission showed 
possible post-obstructive pneumonia which may account for her 
increased WBC.  She was discharged on oral antibiotics.  
.
7. Anemia - iron studies are consistent with anemia of chronic 
disease.  Her Hct remained stable throughout admission.  No 
transfusion was required.  
.  
8. Rheumatoid arthritis - The patient was not taking medications 
at admission and treatment was defered.  She was given 
acetaminophen for pain.  During admission, the patient 
complained of lower back pain and a lumbar spine x-ray showed 
only an old compression fracture of L1.  No new fractures.  A 
bone scan was to be performed to look for bony mets on day of 
discharge, but this was discontinued secondary to a change in 
the patient's treatment goals.  
.

     MRI EXAM OF THE BRAIN WITH MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) 4**].
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Slurred speech and history of renal artery emboli.
     
     BRAIN MRI:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain were obtained
     without intravenous contrast administration.  There are several foci of
     restricted diffusion involving the cerebellar hemispheres and the inferior
     aspect of the cerebellar vermis consistent with multiple embolic subacute
     infarcts, which measures less than 1 cm each.  No abnormalities were seen
     within the brainstem.  Corresponding FLAIR T2 hyperintensities are present
     within the cerebellar hemispheres.  These correspond to posterior circulation
     embolic small subacute infarcts.
     
     Scattered other nonspecific T2 hyperintensities are present along the
     periventricular white matter suggestive of chronic microvascular ischemic or
     gliotic changes.  There is no midline shift, mass effect, or hemorrhage.
     Signal flow voids are present along the intracranial portions of the carotid
     and basilar arteries.  There is no subdural hemorrhage.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Multiple foci of restricted diffusion involving the cerebellar
     hemispheres and the cerebellar vermis consistent with small embolic subacute
     infarcts along the posterior circulation as noted above.
     
     MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) 4**]:  3D time-of-flight MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) **]
     was performed.  The distal vertebral arteries are not well visualized and
     appear to be hypoplastic and probably terminate in the posterior inferior
     cerebellar arteries.  The basilar artery is diminished in caliber and is
     hypoplastic.  This is developmental in nature and probably related to
     bilateral fetal origin of the posterior cerebral arteries.  The exam is
     partially degraded by motion artifact.  No significant abnormalities are seen
     involving the anterior or middle cerebral arteries.  The left A1 segment of
     the ACA is congenitally absent.  No intracranial aneurysms could be seen.  The
     study is insensitive to detect tiny aneurysms less than 3 mm in diameter.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Hypoplastic distal vertebral and basilar circulation.  Fetal
     origin to the PCA.  Congenitally absent A1 segment of the left ACA.  The
     middle cerebral artery circulation is otherwise patent.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     MRI EXAM OF THE BRAIN WITH MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) 4**].
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Slurred speech and history of renal artery emboli.
     
     BRAIN MRI:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain were obtained
     without intravenous contrast administration.  There are several foci of
     restricted diffusion involving the cerebellar hemispheres and the inferior
     aspect of the cerebellar vermis consistent with multiple embolic subacute
     infarcts, which measures less than 1 cm each.  No abnormalities were seen
     within the brainstem.  Corresponding FLAIR T2 hyperintensities are present
     within the cerebellar hemispheres.  These correspond to posterior circulation
     embolic small subacute infarcts.
     
     Scattered other nonspecific T2 hyperintensities are present along the
     periventricular white matter suggestive of chronic microvascular ischemic or
     gliotic changes.  There is no midline shift, mass effect, or hemorrhage.
     Signal flow voids are present along the intracranial portions of the carotid
     and basilar arteries.  There is no subdural hemorrhage.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Multiple foci of restricted diffusion involving the cerebellar
     hemispheres and the cerebellar vermis consistent with small embolic subacute
     infarcts along the posterior circulation as noted above.
     
     MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) 4**]:  3D time-of-flight MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) **]
     was performed.  The distal vertebral arteries are not well visualized and
     appear to be hypoplastic and probably terminate in the posterior inferior
     cerebellar arteries.  The basilar artery is diminished in caliber and is
     hypoplastic.  This is developmental in nature and probably related to
     bilateral fetal origin of the posterior cerebral arteries.  The exam is
     partially degraded by motion artifact.  No significant abnormalities are seen
     involving the anterior or middle cerebral arteries.  The left A1 segment of
     the ACA is congenitally absent.  No intracranial aneurysms could be seen.  The
     study is insensitive to detect tiny aneurysms less than 3 mm in diameter.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Hypoplastic distal vertebral and basilar circulation.  Fetal
     origin to the PCA.  Congenitally absent A1 segment of the left ACA.  The
     middle cerebral artery circulation is otherwise patent.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  74-year-old woman with right renal artery embolus at OSH,
     evaluate sigmoid abscess.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial CT images of the upper abdomen were obtained with
     and without the administration of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 116**], 130 cc of
     Optiray with multiphasic technique.  Delayed images of the abdomen and pelvis
     were obtained  Multiplanar reformation images were reconstructed.
     
     No comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:  Residual contrast in the left kidney is seen on precontrast scan,
     which may be due to reduced renal function. There is a 1.2- cm tubular filling
     defect in proximal portion of right renal artery, with hypoperfusion of the
     entire right kidney, worrisome for renal artery embolism as mentioned in the
     history. Renal artery distal to the clot is opacified. On delayed images, some
     portions of the right kidney showed enhancement, however, there are several
     patchy areas of no enhancement, particularly posteriorly.  Capsular
     enhancement is preserved, as expected for renal infarct. There is no
     hydronephrosis. The left kidney is unremarkable with homogeneous enhancement
     without hydronephrosis or mass. Extensive atherosclerotic disease of the aorta
     is noted.
     
     There are multiple hypodense lesions in the liver in bilateral lobes, the
     largest one in the left lobe measuring 2 cm, most likely representing cyst,
     however, some of the smaller lesions are too small to characterize.  There is
     no intrahepatic ductal dilatation.  Gallbladder is unremarkable without
                                                                 (Over)

     Note is made of surgical suture in the right colon.  The appendix is normal.
     No evidence of significant lymphadenopathy or ascites is noted.
     
     PELVIS:  There is no evidence of ascites or free air.  Note is made of fat
     stranding and inflammatory changes of the sigmoid colon in left lower
     quadrant, associated with area of low-density, which may represent small
     abscess versus fluid collection measuring 1.3 cm.  In the visualized portion
     of the lung bases, note is made of atelectasis.  Right hilar mass and right
     upper lobe opacity noted on prior chest x-ray was not imaged on this abdominal
     CT.
     
     There is compression fracture of L1.  No other suspicious lytic or blastic
     lesion is noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Tubular filling defect measuring 1.2 cm in proximal right renal artery
     with hypoperfusion of right kidney, most likely representing right renal
     artery emboli.  Persistent non-perfusion areas with capsular enhancement seen
     in the right kidney on delayed images, worrisome for renal infarcts.
     2.  Inflammatory changes in sigmoid colon with fat stranding and a 1.3 cm
     adjacent extralumenal loculated fluid collection.
     3.  Compression fracture of L1 vertebra with minimal retropulsion near the
     superior endplate.  This is chronic in appearance.
     4.  Right hilar mass noted on chest x-ray was not imaged on this abdominal

     an outside hospital.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     RENAL ULTRASOUND:  The right kidney measures 8.1 cm.  The left kidney measures
     9.0 cm.  There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or renal stones.  The renal
     cortex of the right kidney demonstrates no definite mass lesion.  The left
     kidney is normal in appearance.  No perinephric fluid is identified.
     
     Doppler evaluation of the renal arteries was limited secondary to patient
     motion and limitations with breath-holding. The left renal arterial RIs were
     0.73-0.79 compared to lower RIs on the right which measured 0.48-0.55. The
     right renal vein was difficult to assess.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No hydronephrosis.
     2.  The renal vein was difficult to assess.
     3.  The resistive indices are slightly less within the right kidney compared
     to the left. Further evaluation with a CTA study is recommended.

     [**Last Name (STitle) 609**], the attending physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1827**] and supervising throughout.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine
     on the table.  The right upper arm was prepped and draped in the usual sterile
     fashion.  No suitable veins were visible, therefore, ultrasound was used to
     identify the right brachial vein, which was patent and compressible.  Using
     real time ultrasound guidance, a 21-gauge needle was used to access the vein.
     Hard copy of the ultrasound images were obtained before and after
     venipuncture documenting vessel patency.  A 0.018 guide wire was threaded
     through the needle and into the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle
     was exchanged for a 4- French micropuncture sheath.  Based on the markers on
     the wire, the PICC was trimmed to 30 cm.  It was then advanced over the wire
     and into the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The peel-away sheath and wire
     were removed, the catheter flushed and heplocked, and then StatLocked.  A
     final fluoroscopic image demonstrates the tip of the PICC in the distal SVC.
     
     There were no immediate complications.
     
     1% lidocaine, approximately 3 mL, were administered subcutaneously for local
     anesthesia.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Hypercalcemia and poor IV access.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  Doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 609**] performed this procedure, with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 609**], the attending physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1827**] and supervising throughout.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine
     on the table.  The right upper arm was prepped and draped in the usual sterile
     fashion.  No suitable veins were visible, therefore, ultrasound was used to
     identify the right brachial vein, which was patent and compressible.  Using
     real time ultrasound guidance, a 21-gauge needle was used to access the vein.
     Hard copy of the ultrasound images were obtained before and after
     venipuncture documenting vessel patency.  A 0.018 guide wire was threaded
     through the needle and into the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle
     was exchanged for a 4- French micropuncture sheath.  Based on the markers on
     the wire, the PICC was trimmed to 30 cm.  It was then advanced over the wire
     and into the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The peel-away sheath and wire
     were removed, the catheter flushed and heplocked, and then StatLocked.  A
     final fluoroscopic image demonstrates the tip of the PICC in the distal SVC.
     
     There were no immediate complications.
     
     1% lidocaine, approximately 3 mL, were administered subcutaneously for local
     anesthesia.
     
     IMPRESSION:  30 cm double lumen PICC in right brachial vein with tip in SVC,

     INDICATION:  Slurred speech.  Right upper lobe mass, please evaluate.
     
     COMPARISON:  Abdomen CT, [**2820-6-21**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contrast-enhanced axial CT imaging of the chest was reviewed.
     Coronal reformats were obtained and reviewed.
     
     CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is a very large heterogeneous right hilar mass
     with multiple areas of central necrosis, centered in the right superior
     mediastinum and measuring 7.1 x 5.1 cm in axial diameters and 10 cm in
     longitudinal diameter, extending up to the level of the thyroid.  This mass is
     conglomerate with multiple enlarged necrotic.  mediastinal lymph nodes, such
     as enlarged subcarinal node measuring 3.8 x 2.4 cm.  There is extension of
     mass into the right main bronchus with a 1.5 cm segment that is occluded.
     There is also tumor extension into the SVC.  There is interstitial thickening
     and fibrosis with honeycombing in the right upper lobe, secondary to a large
     hilar mass with elevation of the minor fissure and other areas of denser
     consolidation. No pathologic axillary adenopathy is identified.  The right
     lower lobe and left lung are clear.  A central line is present terminating at
     the cavoatrial junction.  The heart and great vessels of the mediastinum are
     only remarkable for atherosclerotic disease.  The pulmonary arteries opacify
     without evidence for filling defects.
     
     Multiple hypodense lesions are present in the liver, the largest in the left
     lobe measuring 2 cm and consistent with simple cyst.  The others are too small
     to characterize.  Again noted is significant decrease in perfusion of the
     right kidney secondary to thrombus.  For further detail, please see the CTA
     abdomen from [**2820-6-21**].  Tiny calcifications are present in the pancreas.
     Contrast is present in the gallbladder from a previous contrast study.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There is a compression deformity of T9 of indeterminate age. No
     sclerotic or lytic lesions are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  
     
     1.  A very large heterogeneous right hilar mass measuring 7 cm with multiple

     Reason: Please evaluate for post obstructive pna, pleural effusions 
     Admitting Diagnosis: LUNG MASS, DIVERTICULAR ABSCESS
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      74 year old woman with lung mass and now SOB                                    
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please evaluate for post obstructive pna, pleural effusions

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Lung mass and shortness of breath.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2820-6-21**].
     
     PA AND LATERAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  New right PICC tip terminates in the mid
     SVC.  Right upper lobe consolidation is worse, and there is a persistent right
     hilar mass.  There is increased volume loss within the right lung with
     elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and mild shift of mediastinal structures.
     The left lung is clear.  The cardiac contours are unchanged.  There is no
     pneumothorax.  Blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly on the lateral
     views suggest small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is diffuse osteopenia
     with compression of several thoracic vertebral bodies.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Worsening right upper lobe post-obstructive pneumonia secondary to right
     hilar mass with increased volume loss in the right lung.
     2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
     3.  PICC tip projects over mid SVC.
