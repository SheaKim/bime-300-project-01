                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Worsening cough, question seizure.
     
     Comparison is made to the prior CT scan, dated [**3156-5-13**].
     
     FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
     low lung volumes.  Consistent with the prior chest CT, there is evidence for a
     large hiatal hernia.  Bilateral lower lobe and retrocardiac air space
     opacities are demonstrated.  The heart size is not well assessed given
     technique, but grossly unremarkable.  The osseous structures appear stable
     with again note of kyphosis of the thoracic spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Low lung volumes with bilateral lower lobe atelectasis/consolidation.
     
     2.  Large hiatal hernia.

History of Present Illness:
84 y.o. man with multiple medical problems admitted to ICU for 
pneumonia, respiratory failure and septic shock.  History is per 
daughter.  Per daughter, he has been feeling weak over the last 
10 days or so.  On Monday, he sufferred a GTC seizure which he 
has not had in a few years.  He came to ED here at [**Hospital1 19**], and 
was evaluated.  Workup at the time showed no abnormality though 
CXR showed possible infiltrate.  Pt was discharged back home 
where he has 24 hour caretakers.  He continued to feel weak, but 
had no other focal complaints.  Per daughter, he was not 
complaining of SOB, CP, cough, fever.  Last night, he felt cold. 
 This continued until today, when he felt cold to the touch and 
a temperature taken showed T=32 Celsius.  He was brought to the 
ED.  Here he was found to be hypotensive to SBP in 80s and 90s.  
He did not have significant response to fluid bolus (? 2L ).  A 
central line was placed and he was started on dopamine and 
levophed.  CXR showed bibasilar infiltrate so he was treated for 
pneumonia with ceftriaxone, vancomycine, levaquin and flagyl.  
Due to hypoxia (78% RA, 91% on NRB), he was intubated.  He was 
then transferred up to MICU for further management.  He received 
a total of 5.3 L NS in ED.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 y.o. man with h/o hypothyroidism, pneumonia, seizures, 
diastolic CHF who presents with hypothermia, hypoxia, and 
hypotension.  CXR revealed pneumonia, and hypothermia and 
hypotension consistent with septic shock from pneumonia.  
Etiology of pneumonia unclear--may have been secondary to 
aspiration event from seizure, but more likely preceeded seizure 
given his generalized weakness.
..
..
1) Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Secondary to multilobar 
pneumonia.  Initial ABG was 7.17/64/106 suggesting respiratory 
acidosis from hypoventilation.  Pt was intubated and remained on 
venilator for 2 wks. He was extubated on [**3157-12-18**]. He remained off 
the ventlator for 1 wk but was re-intubated secondary to hypoxia 
and hypercarbia. He remained intubated for 1 wk. After 
discussion with family the goals of care were changed to 
comfort. He was extubated on [**3157-12-28**] and expired 4 hours later.
..
2) Pneumonia:  Covered broadly for PNA with zosyn and 
vancomycin. He competed a 14 day course. Sputum cultures at that 
time showed only OP flora and blood cultures were neagative.  
When he was re-intubated, he had increaed respiratory secretions 
and was started again on Zosyn/Vancomycin. Sputum cultures were 
then re-sent and came back positive for SERRATIA MARCESCENS and 
ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE. Zosyn was discontinued and meropenum 
started. Pt expired on meropenum and vancomycin after goals were 
changed to comfort.
.
3) Septic shock:  PT was hypotensive through out his hospital 
stay. He had an abnormal cortisol stimulation test and was 
placed on stress dose steroids. Hes was intermitanly on levophed 
for blood pressure support.

     both bases.  There is a small-to-moderate right and small left effusion.
     Cardiac borders are obscured.  The left hilum appears quite prominent,
     unchanged.  The pulmonary findings and effusions are probably also essentially
     unchanged.  There is only minimal upper zone redistribution.

NPN 7a-7p

Events- Pt. tachypneic w/ decreasing sat's on A/C about 12p, changed to PSV, appeared more comfortable w/ decreased WOB and improving saturations.  Episodic tachpnea w/ and w/o desaturation throughout the day allievated w/ 1mg boluses of versed (X3) and sx'ing.  While on Left side, desaturated <89%.  Therefore, avoiding left side down positioning.  Given lasix for ? vol. overload as evidence by low u/o, high CVP and frequent PACs- good u/o throughout the day.  Started insulin gtt for goal BS 80-110.  

Brief Review of Systems-

Please refer to flowsheet for detailed objective data

Neuro-  Daily wake up done at 8a, sedation completely off from 8a-12p. Versed 1mg/hr w/ 1mg bolus restarted at 12p d/t increased WOB w/ slight agitation noted.  While off sedation, pt. making purposeful movements with all four extremeties, spontenously opening eyes but not engaged in any way.  Pt. appearing quite lethargic and delirious.  Plan-  would bolus prn w/ versed in addition to 1mg/hr gtt, keeping fentanyl off, daily wake up again in the am. 

Resp-  Currently on PSV 20/ PEEP 8 50%. Desaturations and tachpnea continuing to be the barrier to further weaning and RSBI/ SBT.  Hypoxic on ABG this am, sat's hovering around 89-90%.  Thus, fio2 increased 60% and PEEP to 8. Thought to be d/t volume overload and pneumonia.  Now, tolerating fio2 of 50%.  Sx'ing q3-4 for thick, blood tinged secretions.  Plan-  added vanco to zosyn regimen, potential RSBI in the am, cont on PSV as tolerated overnoc.

CV-  Frequent PACs throughout the day, improved now post lasix.  Conts on vasopressin until midnight (per attending).  Off levophed since midnight last night, BP much improved.  PLT dropping, heparin products d/c'd.  Plan-  goal CVP 15-18, u.o 30c/hr, MAP >60, cont diuresis as tolerated.  Would recheck pm lytes if give more lasix.  Heparin antibody testing pending.  

GI-  TF nearing goal of 85cc/hr w/ residuals climbing throughout the day, thus not advanced past current rate of 75cc/hr.  ABD benign.  No stool.  Plan- cont to advance towards goal as tolerated. 

Endo-  Insulin gtt started as BS range around 150 for 24 hours.  Started at 1.0 and currently at 2.5u/hr w/ BS on downward trend.  Goal BS 80-110.  

GU-  U/O marginal this am, given 20mg of lasix w/ much improvment.  Tapering off again for 1700.  Plan-  consider second dose of lasix if BP tolerates.  CVP >15 currently.  

ID-  Afebrile.  Vanco added for pna.  Secretions purulent.  Conts on zo-syn.  

Social-  All children in today requesting daily wake up be done tom'row when wife comes in... discussed at length the current state of pt and our future plan of care, appear satisfied w/ info and hopeful.  House staff also met w/ dtrs.

NPN 7a-7p  

Events-  Pt. tolerating PSV throughout the day, decreased on rounds to PSV of 15, decreased fio2 this evening to 40%.  Unable to turn vasopressin off d/t decreasing MAPs.  Off sedatives since noon for daily wake up.  Given lasix x 1.

Brief review of systems-

please see flowsheet for detailed objective data...

Neuro-  Received on 2mg of versed/hr.  Turned off at 12p for daily wake up.  Has appeared increasingly more awake as evidence by opening eyes, coughing, tachypnea, leaning towards ETT.  However, has required bolus of 1mg X 2 w/ repositioning.  Would expect pt. to be more wakeful over the next few hours.  Plan-  use bolus sedative method as appropriate to achieve optimal level of ventilation and sedation.

Resp-  Currently on PSV 15, PEEP 8 40% w/ RR of 30-35 TV 300-350 will increase to PSV 20 d/t tachypnea.  Sat's remaining >95% today showing improvment in oxygenation overall today.  Also tolerating turning much better including on left side for CPT and postural drainage.  Plan- cont on PSV as tol, consider resting A/C, follow sats closely, CXR in am, continue vanco, zosyn for pna, aggressive pulm toilet.

CV-  HR continues to be very variable from 40-120's Sinus Rhythm w/ PACs noted.  12 lead EKG done to show team and confirm sinus rhythm.  BP stable, not allowing cessation of vasopression, MAPs falling <60.  Skin becoming much more edemedous despite lasix dosing at high risk for breakdown on extremeties and weeping.  Plan-  reattempt cessation of vasopressin this evening or tom'row, cont lasix (another dose ordered for this evening), cont to monitor rhythm changes, goal CVP <18, goal MAP >60.  

GI-  ABD soft, TF at goal, passing stool X 3 in moderate amounts, thick, brown.  Mushroom catheter attempted for stool containment.  However, stool is too thick.  Colace held this am.  Plan-  maintain TF at goal rate.  

Endo-  conts on insulin gtt w/ goal BS 80-110.  Currently infusing at 3u/hr.  

GU-  Lasix given at 12p w/ good output following for 5 hours, now dropping off this last hour.  KCL 40 meQ given for K+ of 3.3 checked at 4p.  Another dose of lasix ordered as mentioned for this evening.  

ID-  Afebrile w/ slight hypothermia.  Conts on synthroid.  Conts on IVABX as mentioned.  Pt. appears to be recovering from severe sepsis.  However, vasopressin dependent at this time.  Plan- cont current plan of care for treatment of pna/ supportive sepsis therapies.

Social-  Wife accompanied by dtr and son in today, all updated on plan of care by nursing.  Other dtr and grandchildren due in tonoc.

     HISTORY:  Question change in infiltrate, volume overload.
     
     CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
     
     An ET tube is present, in satisfactory position approximately 3.4 cm above the
     carina.  A left subclavian central line is present, tip over proximal SVC.  An
     NG tube is present, tip is widely coiled.  While the tip may lie in the fundus
     of a hernia or elevated hemidiaphragm, I cannot confirm that the tip lies
     beneath the diaphragm.  Clinical correlation is requested.  This is unchanged
     compared with multiple prior studies.
     
     There is cardiomegaly, with a prominent aortic knob and possibly also a
     prominent main pulmonary artery. There is upper zone redistribution and
     diffuse vascular blurring.  There are small-to-moderate bilateral effusions
     with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
     
     Compared with [**3157-12-7**], the findings are essentially unchanged, but the degree
     of CHF may be slightly worse.

     wall on the right.  There is persistent pulmonary vascular congestion and mild
     pulmonary edema.  Airspace disease within the right lung base is poorly

     HISTORY:  84-year-old man with shortness of breath, pneumonia, and is
     intubated.  Patient with worsening respiratory status.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the previous study from [**3157-12-13**],
     and [**3157-12-14**].
     
     There is an endotracheal tube which is appropriately sited.  There is a
     nasogastric tube with a single coil within the region of the gastroesophageal
     junction, unchanged.  There is a left central venous catheter whose distal tip
     is perpendicular to the SVC wall, also unchanged.
     
     There is stable cardiomegaly and large bilateral pleural effusions.  The
     pleural effusion on the right side has increased slightly and is tracking
     along the right lateral chest wall.  There is prominence of the pulmonary
     vasculature markings with more confluent opacities in the right upper lobe.
     This is most consistent with pulmonary edema.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Lines and tubes are in unchanged position and as described above.  The
     nasogastric tube has a single loop in the upper stomach/gastroesophageal
     junction.

Team spoke to him and his family about what their wishes would be for pt if we can extubate him and family has gone home to discuss possible need for trach. This would mean pt would need to go to [**Hospital1 89**] because their 24hr caretakers at home are not skilled with the kind of care he would need after a trach. They are talking at home as a family and spoke to the pt about it and he is thinking about it. Pt can have small doses of versed if needed but I have held off today due to hypotension.

this is an 84 y.o. man adm [**12-4**] with sepsis, resp failure, hypotension, tx'd with ivf, pressors, and abx for pna, slow to wean from vent, with high rsbi in 180s but fully awake, anxious mouthing to have ett removed with stable 02 sats, hr and bp. rr has been climbing up as high as 50 over the last few days as pt becoming very anxious to have ett out. rr decreasing to the 30s at rest. micu team decided on rounds pt ready for extubation and dtr [**Name (NI) **] aware and in agreement that if pt needs to be reintubated an ett will be reinserted until trach placement done. pt was extubated at 11:30am. pre abg: 7.43/50/64. pt's sat dropped to 87% on 100% cool neb face tent. pt switched to 80% high flow 02 with repeat abg: 7.23/69/156 with sats 89-91%. 02 was decreased to 60% with repeat abg: 7.28/44/77. sats improved over the next few hrs up to as high as 98% with pt's breathing rate down to the 20s instead of the high 30s with minimal use of accessory muscles. 

neuro: very alert today able to mouth words to communicate although very hard to understand what he is saying. too weak with too much edema in hands to communicate via sign. asl interpreters were up prior to extubation to communicate to pt that he would be extubated. pt appeared to understand but difficult to understand alot of his mouthing words. perrla 3mm brisk. mae wiggling toes and lifting up arms. attempting to pull off ett and mask after extubation, thus bilat wrist restraints maintained. 

cv: hr ranging 80s-113 sr/st with no ectopy noted. bp ranging 90s-130s/50s-70s. with captopril held for sbp < 95 in am. unable to take po meds at this time in pm post extubation. still with sig. 3+ generalized edema in ext and scrotal area. ext. and scrotum elevated with scrotal area separated from groin area as + fungal rash around groin area. +difficult to palpate pp. 

resp: see above. continues on high flow 02 at 60% with sats in mid 90s. with rr in 20s appearing comfortable. encouraged to cough and given cpt with turns. was able to cough up small amt white thick sputum x1. now with weak nonproductive cough.

     UPRIGHT AP PORTABLE CHEST AT 11:10:  Compared with the study of approximately
     one hour prior, the feeding tube has been advanced and coils distally.  It
     probably lies within the known large hiatal hernia.  The relationship to the
     diaphragm is uncertain since the diaphragmatic contours remain obscured by

     INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, pneumonia, assess PICC placement.
     
     Additional history from the PICC nurse is a right PICC was inserted yesterday,
     the wire removed, assessing for reposition.
     
     AP portable was compared to [**3157-12-21**] at 19:01.  Tip of a left-sided catheter
     projects over the SVC that is unchanged.  No PICC is identified on today's
     study or yesterday's study.  Bilateral parenchymal opacities secondary to
     pulmonary edema have worsened in the interval.  Superimposed airspace
     consolidations are also likely.  Bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No PICC identified.  Worsening pulmonary edema.

     assessment, unable to evaluate on previous chest x-ray.
     
     Two views of the AP chest were reviewed with emphasis on the right chest.
     Again no PICC catheter can be demonstrated on the right.  The lateral chest
     wall is visible and no catheter is visible within the soft tissues of the
     chest either.  Again the left subclavian catheter tip projects over the SVC.
     Given lack the appearance of the PICC on chest x-ray, it was adviced that a
     new PICC may need to be placed in order to assure its proper position as the
     current PICC if present within the chest is not radio opaque.

     AP CHEST, 6:42 A.M., [**12-23**].
     
     HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and pneumonia.  PICC line placed.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to chest films since December, most recently
     [**12-21**] and 8th:
     
     Asymmetric distribution of worsening consolidation over the past several days
     accompanied by increasing pleural effusions suggests that the major pulmonary
     abnormality is edema, which would obscure any pneumonia.  Heart is large, but
     probably unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  Tip of left subclavian line
     projects over the SVC.

     INDICATION:  Endotracheal tube placement.
     
     There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, terminating
     approximately 4 cm above the carina.  Central venous catheter is unchanged in
     position.  There has been interval worsening of the bilateral air space
     pattern most likely due to pulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural effusions have
     also increased in the interval.

ROS:
NEURO: Pt appeared uncomfortable at start of shift, attempting to sit up, gagging on ETT. Sedation increased to Fentanyl 100mch/hr and Versed 3mg/hr with excellent effect. Pt able to tolerate interventions with no boluses required. Moving UE's, not moving LE's. Not following commands, though is deaf. Pupils pinpoint, NR (? surgical). 
RESP: Multiple vent changes made to correct alkalosis and relative hypoxia. Oxygenation has improved this AM. Most recent ABG 7.42/61/158 on CMV .6/450/10/8; FiO2 decreased to 50% and he is maintaining sats of 98-100%. Tolerating turning to R better than yesterday. LS coarse t/o; decreased need for suctioning overnight; secretions are thick and bloody. 
C-V: Trial off esmolol resulted in run of afib after about 1 hour, with associated dramatic decrease in BP. Esmolol resumed at previous rate after re-bolusing, with no further afib noted. HR 80's off esmolol, now 50's. CVP 12-16. Unable to wean off levophed even while esmolol was off; titrating to SBP >100, MAP >65. Pt currently recieving KPhos for Phos of 1.6 last evening; repeat level this AM 2.8 midway through infusion. Free water boluses for hypernatremia; other lytes are WNL.
GI: After several attempts by RN and MD, an OGT was placed and confirmed by CXR. TF's initiated at MN, well-tolerated thus far. Belly benign, minimal brown liquid stool.
GU: Very poor UO late evening; no improvement with trial of increasing SBP to ~120. CXR showed CHF, therefore he was given 20mg Lasix with modest results of ~100cc/hr. BUN/creat WNL.
ID: Afebrile, WBC 4.9 (3.5). Sputum from [**12-23**] growing 4+ GNR's. Pt is off all abx.

SOCIAL: Pt's dtr and son-in-law called for update late evening. They stated that they were aware of the events of the day, but they demonstrated poor knowledge/understanding of what had taken place, as well as how ETT/OGT are different from trach/PEG (they were under the impression that he had the trach and PEG done. Explanation and teaching provided, with family stating they were clearer afterwards. 

A: remains dependent on esmolol and levo

P: consider lightening sedation and trial of PSV; readdress esmolol, ? change to oral beta blocker; wean levo as able; diurese as indicated; follow lytes and replete prn; advance TF's as tolerated towards goal of 50cc/hr; follow sugars closely; assess for any evidence of bleeding; follow for evidence of infection; continue skin care; anticipate trach/PEG/PICC; continue to inform and support family.
