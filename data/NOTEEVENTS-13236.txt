CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post assault.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 83-year-old
gentleman involved in an altercation with another patient in
an Alzheimer's Unit.  Patient had questionable loss of
consciousness.  The patient had been acting more confused
than his baseline following the altercation.  Apparently, the
patient was pushed up against a fish tank and then thrown to
ground during the altercation.  The patient was originally
taken to the [**Hospital 276**] Hospital, where films revealed a
subarachnoid hemorrhage and a subdural hemorrhage.  There is
also question of a right hip fracture.

heart rate 100, respiratory rate 18, and O2 saturation is 100
percent on nonrebreather.  His white cell count 17,
hematocrit 31, platelets 281, creatinine 1.9.  GCS 14.
HEENT:  Pupils were equal and reactive.  Extraocular muscles
are intact.  Tympanic membranes are clear.  Oropharynx was
clear.  Cardiovascular:  Atrial fibrillation, irregular.
Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Chest:  No
deformities.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended,
positive bowel sounds.  Pelvis is stable.  Back:  C spine and
TLS no deformities or step-offs.  Rectal:  Guaiac negative,
good rectal tone.  Upper extremities:  No deformities.  Lower
extremities:  No deformities and decreased movement of the
right lower extremity.

RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray:  Cardiomegaly.

Pelvis:  Questionable right femur fracture.

C spine:  C1 and C2 subluxation.

CT of the head showing a left temporal subarachnoid and
subdural hemorrhage, a right frontal contusion, right
temporal contusion.

TLS:  Questionable L1 fracture.

Right hip:  Questionable right femur fracture.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Trauma
Intensive Care Service.  A Neurosurgery consult was called.
Their recommendations included starting Dilantin, continuing
with blood pressures less than 140, and repeat CT scan of the
head in the morning.  Orthopedics was also consulted due to
the patient's right femur fracture.  Their recommendations
included an ORIF when the patient was stable.

During the patient's hospitalization stay, CT scan and MRI
showed blossoming of the intracerebral injuries.  The
patient's mental status deteriorated.  Neurosurgery's
recommendations were that time would be needed to clarify his
prognosis.  They also stated that his prognosis was poor.
The patient's neurologic status during that time also
deteriorated to the point, where he was unable to move his
lower extremities and had slight motor in his right upper
extremity.

Multiple family discussions were held during the
hospitalization, and it was decided on the [**4-8**]
after an extensive conversation with the patient's son and
family, that he would be made CMO.  Following the withdraw of
care, the patient initially went into a respiratory arrest
followed by a cardiac arrest.  The family was informed and
the medical examiner was called and accepted the case.

     HISTORY:  Altercation at nursing home.  Cerebral hemorrhage.  Assess
     progression.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3020-2-1**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is slight increase in the intraventricular component of
     hemorrhage with larger hematocrit levels noted in the posterior horns of the
     lateral ventricles.  There is more than expected density along the tentorium,
     left greater than right, raising the possibility of small subdural hemorrhages
     at this location.  Small subdural hemorrhage in the left occipitoparietal
     region is unchanged, and extraaxial subarachnoid hemorrhage over the left
     convexity and, to a lesser extent, right convexity may have increased slightly
     in the interval.  Contusions in the temporal lobe on the left and frontal lobe
     on the right, in addition to inferior temporal lobes, are roughly unchanged. A
     small amount of blood is present in the interpeduncular cistern again. There
     is hypodensity in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, which is
     unchanged and probably represents chronic microvascular infarction. There is
     no shift of normally midline structures or significant mass effect related to
     the aforementioned hemorrhages, and the patient's ventricular size is
     unchanged.  There is prominent CSF space anteriorly over the frontal lobes,
     which is approximately equivalent since the prior study and may reflect
     underlying brain atrophy or could represent small bilateral subdural hygromas.
     
     The appearance of the bones is unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Slight progression of intracranial hemorrhage with subdural
     hematoma along the tentorium becoming evident, and with slightly increased
     amounts of intraventricular and subarachnoid blood.

     vertical alignment of the component vertebrae appears unremarkable.  There are
     no other subluxations. There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling.  There
     is disc narrowing and osteophytic changes in the cervical spine.  There is no
     definite evidence of fracture.  CT does not provide intrathecal detail.  The
     thyroid is unusually hypodense which could be seen in thyroiditis.  However
     there are no discrete nodules.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Right hip pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MR examination of the hips was performed utilizing the following
     sequences:  Axial and coronal T1 weighted images, axial T2 weighted inversion
     recovery images, and sagittal T2 weighted images with fat saturation.
     
     Comparison is made to radiographs of the right femur obtained earlier the same
     day.
     
      MR OF THE HIPS WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is linear intermediate signal on T1
     weighted images traversing the intertrochanteric region and extending distally
     and out through the right lateral metadiaphyseal cortex of the proximal right
     femur, representing an intertrochanteric fracture with infratrochanteric
     extension.  The fracture line does not seem to involve the femoral neck.
     
     The fracture is nondisplaced.  Both femoral heads maintain a normal smooth
     contour without evidence of collapse.
     
     A small region of intermediate signal is seen in the subcapital left femoral
     neck -- this is of uncertain etiology, but is not typical for fracture.
     
     There is abnormal high signal on T2 weighted sequences involving the muscle
     groups and fascial planes about the proximal right femur, circumferentially,
     thought to represent edema secondary to fracture.
     
     A small amount of increased signal adjacent and surrounding the proximal left
     common femoral vessels is of uncertain clinical significance.
     
     There is a Foley catheter present within the urinary bladder.  Bladder wall
     thickening, trabeculation, and several bladder diverticula are noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Nondisplaced intertrochanteric fracture of the right femur with inferior
     lateral sutrochanteric extension.
     
     Small focus in the left subcapital femur and Tiny amount of edema adjacent to
     the left common femoral vessels, of uncertain clinical significance.
     
     These findings were reported to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 14010**] [**Name (STitle) 2430**] on [**3020-2-2**] at 11 o'clock A.M.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Multiple head injuries with possible subluxation of C1-C2.
     Radiographs also demonstrated a compression fracture of L1.  The patient is
     status post assault.
     
     The following dictation includes dictations for both the cervical and lumbar
     spine.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast MRI of the cervical spine.
     
     FINDINGS:  Please refer to the dictation of a recent CT of the brain for
     description of intracranial hemorrhage.
     
     There is no spinal cord signal abnormality.  At C2-3 and C3-4, the spinal
     canal and neural foramina are widely patent.
     
     At C4-5, there is a small posterior disc protrusion with mild spinal stenosis.
     The neural foramina are widely patent.
     
     At C5-6, there is a mild posterior disc protrusion with mild spinal stenosis,
     but no neural foraminal narrowing.
     
     At C6-7, there is a broad based disc osteophyte complex with mild spinal canal
     stenosis and mild narrowing of the left neural foramen.  At C7-T1, the spinal
     canal and neural foramina are widely patent.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Mild multilevel cervical spondylosis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast multiplanar MRI of the lumbar spine.
     
     FINDINGS:  As demonstrated on radiographs of [**3020-2-1**], there is a severe
     compression deformity of the L1 vertebral body.  There is minimal retropulsion
     of L1 with minimal narrowing of the spinal canal.  The distal spinal cord
     appears normal and the conus is in normal position, terminating at
     approximately the L1-2 level.  The remainder of the lumbar spine is within
     normal limits.  There is a 4.5 cm simple right renal cyst.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1.  Severe compression deformity of the L1 vertebral body with
     minimal retropulsion and minimal narrowing of the spinal canal.
     2.  4.5 cm simple right renal cyst.

     INDICATION:  S/P subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Assess for aspiration pneumonia on
     tube feeds.
     
     FINDINGS:  Compared with [**3020-2-2**], there is now increased patchy
     infiltrate present at the left base and also involving more of the superior
     portions of the left lower lobe.  The remainder of the lung fields are grossly
     clear.
     
     The tip of the NGT is in the proximal stomach.  Its most proximal side-hole is
     difficult to precisely localize on this exposure, but appears near the level
     of the GE junction as previously, and could be advanced.

     INDICATIONS:  Subarachnoid hemorrhage, status post NG tube placement. 
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST: Comparison is made to the study from [**3020-2-3**].
     
     FINDINGS: The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. There has
     been interval placement of a nasogastric tube with the side port superior to
     the gastroesophageal junction, and should be advanced approximately 5 cm.
     There is stable cardiomegaly. There is interval improvement in the bilateral
     perihilar haziness and vascular engorgement consistent with interval
     improvement in mild congestive heart failure. Patchy opacities are present at
     both lung bases which may represent atelectasis versus aspiration.  No
     pneumothorax is identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Nasogastric tube in suboptimal position with side port above the
     gastroesophageal junction. The nasogastric tube should be advanced
     approximately 5 cm.
     2.  Interval improvement of mild CHF.
     3.  Patchy opacities within both bases may represent atelectasis versus
     aspiration pneumonia.

     AP SEMI-UPRIGHT VIEW OF CHEST:  The patient is status post median sternotomy
     and CABG.  The nasogastric tube remains just below the left hemidiaphragm, and
     it should be advanced.  There is a retrocardiac opacity, which may represent
     aspiration pneumonitis.  There is diffuse haziness over the right lung base,
     representing a right pleural effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe opacity, likely aspiration.

     FINDINGS:  A left CVL is seen with the tip at the juncture of the SVC and
     right atrium - no pneumothorax.  Prominent density projects over the right
     apex which is quite different compared to the prior study.  This could be a
     developing pneumonia but with some motion artifact the possibility that this
     is not real exists.  Otherwise the heart, lungs and mediastinum are not
     significantly changed.  There is no pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Right CVL placement with no PTX.
     
     Increased opacity over right apex - possible pneumonia.  Was this a difficult
     line to establish?  If so, the possibility of hematoma should be considered.
