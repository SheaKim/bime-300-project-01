Allergies: 
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2037**] 
Chief Complaint:
hypotension, altered mental status
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP, and biliary stent placement by IR
 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 8501**] is an 82 year old woman with pancreatic Ca, gastric 
outlet obstruction and questionable biliary obstruction, s/p 
plastic stent in CBD placed by GI several months ago. She was 
transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for ERCP today with bacteremia and 
septic picture.  
She had ERCP today - GI could not cannulate ampula due to mass, 
placed  duodenal stent. IR wants to confirm biliary obstruction 
+ assess the anatomy before potential PTC tomorrow.  She is 
admitted to the FICU for hypotension and altered mental status.
.
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 390**] from a nursing home 
on [**3466-3-25**] with intractable nausea and vomiting and coffee 
ground emesis.
She was to have ERCP as above today to look at possible 
dudodenal obstruction with potential palliative stenting.
.
During the procedure GI doctors made aware by physicians at 
[**Hospital3 **] that patient had blood cultures growing GNR's.
.
On seeing the patient, she is unable to provide much history.
She has received about 2 liters of normal saline for blood 
pressure in 80's to 90's.  Throughout ERCP blood pressure had 
been in this range.

 
Past Medical History:
1. Metastatic pancreatic carcinoma diagnosed in September of 
2005-CT scan at [**Hospital3 **] done weeks ago showed mets to liver, 
lungs, and obstruction of portal, splenic veins
2. GI bleeding--recent, [**3-15**] at [**Hospital3 **], EGD revealed 
erosive esophagitis and dudoenal inflammation raising concern 
for duodenal outlet obstruction. 
3. diabetes mellitus
4. formerly hypertension
5. Orthostatic hypotension
 
Social History:
Resides in skilled nursing facility. No smoking, occasional 
alcohol, no drug use.

2. Small right pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis.
3. Multiple small nodular opacities in both lungs, suspicious 
for metastasis. CT may be helpful for further evaluation.
.
[**3466-3-28**] CT abd/pelvis: 1. Extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation 
measuring 9 mm in diameter. Pneumobilia.
2. Large pancreatic mass with hepatic, splenic, and likely 
osseous metastases. Common bile duct and duodenal stent.
.
[**3466-3-28**] ERCP: Three spot fluoroscopic images were obtained 
without a radiologist present. The initial scout image 
demonstrates a plastic biliary stent overlying the right upper 
quadrant as well as surgical clips at the level of the cystic 
duct and gallbladder. A guide wire is seen within the duodenum. 
The final image demonstrates an enteral Wallstent traversing the 
duodenum with proximal end within the antrum.
.
[**3466-3-29**] PTBD: 1. Percutaneous cholangiogram demonstrated mildly 
distended intrahepatic biliary ducts and severely distended 
proximal common bile duct with a large filling defect occupying 
most of the common bile duct and extending to the ampulla. The 
in situ plastic stent previously placed by gastroenterology was 
demonstrated within the filling defect in the common bile duct. 
A plastic stent was partially obstructed.
2. 10 mm by 94 mm Wallstent was placed across the narrow common 
bile duct extending from the bifurcation of the common bile duct 
to the duodenum. Post deployment balloon dilatation of the stent 
with mm balloon catheter was performed.
3. An external internal biliary drain was left in place 
extending from the peripheral branch of the right intrahepatic 
biliary duct into the duodenum. The biliary drain was capped for 
internal drainage.
.
EKG: no acute changes

 
Brief Hospital Course:
# Pancreatic cancer: Ms. [**Known patient lastname 8501**] has extensive metastatic 
pancreatic cancer ith gastric outlet obstruction, duodenal 
obstruction and possible biliary obstruction. She is now s/p 
stent placement by IR, with drain in place. It drained to her GI 
tract. The IR team felt that at some point in the coming weeks, 
her internal stents will become blocked from her disease so they 
left the external drain in-place.  It can remained plugged until 
she develops itching or any signs that the stents are clogged.  
She should have LFT's checked twice a week and if starting to 
rise, her drain should be unplugged.

# Hypotension:  This was likely secondary to cholangitis/sepsis: 
with rising LFTs's, tbili, and she has a known biliary 
obstruction from pancreatic cancer. Her blood cultures from the 
OSH grew pan-sensitive E Coli. She was initially treated with 
Zosyn, and admitted to the FICU after hypotension in the ERCP 
suite. During that procedure, one stent was placed, but was not 
sufficient to remove the obstruction. Overnight she was treated 
with IV fluids for hypotension after a central line was placed. 
She was also briefly on levophed to maintain a MAP > 55. THe 
following day she had a second stent placement, by IR, and has 
an external/internal drain in place, draining into the GI tract. 
After the cultures returned as pan-sensitive E Coli, she was 
switched from Zosyn to Levaquin, started [**3466-3-29**]. Surveillance 
blood cultures were drawn [**3-28**], [**3-29**], and [**3-30**], and are all 
NGTD. Her LFTs were followed, and are trending down. She will 
complete a 14 day course of the levoquin.  The day of discharge 
([**3466-4-3**]) was day #[**7-13**].

# Afib: Intially during her stay Ms. [**Known patient lastname 8501**] was going in and out 
of Afib. She has no known h/o Afib. However, her EKGs showed 
irregular rhythm at times, and appeared to have P waves at times 
as well. She cannot be anticoagulated given recent GIB. She was 
started a low dose beta blocker for HR control

# Recent GI bleeding: Ms [**Known patient lastname 8501**] had recent GIB at OSH, which now 
appears to be stabilized. We maintained a type and screen, 
treated her with IV ppi, and followed Q12hr hct. She had a 
hematocrit drop following her procedure fomr 31 to 27, but then 
stabalized.  She is being discharged with a hct of 33.

# Diabetes: She was on an insulin sliding scale.

# coaulopathy: secondary to sepsis vs. liver failure vs. dic. 
DIC labs negative. Followed INR, gave FFP for her IR procedure.

# Code:DNR/DNI--had extensive discussions with [**Doctor First Name 1300**] and [**Doctor First Name 3927**] 
as well as sister [**Name (NI) **].  They serve as next of [**Doctor First Name **] and health 
care proxies.  

# Communication: [**Doctor First Name **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8502**] is sister, Niece.

     INDICATION:  82-year-old woman with pancreatic carcinoma and gastric outlet
     obstruction with questionable biliary obstruction status post plastic stent in
     the common bile duct several months ago, now septic.
     
     COMPARISON:  ERCP from [**3465-9-1**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contrast enhanced CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was
     reviewed.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  Multiple small 3- to 5-mm pulmonary nodules are
     identified in both lungs, no comparison is available.  Ill-defined patchy
     ground-glass opacities are also present in both lungs.  A very small right
     pleural effusion is present.  There is evidence for at least one metastatic
     lesion in the liver that measures 7 mm in the right lobe.  A 1.3 cm cyst is
     present within the left lobe.  Near the dome of the liver is another area of
     possible metastatic standing, moderate ascites is present around the liver.
     Intrahepatic bile ducts are dilated measuring up to 9 mm in diameter.
     Pneumobilia is also present.  Common bile ducts may dilate further just
     superior to the common bile duct stent, though this is somewhat limited given
     artifact from the stent and dense contrast in the left colon from a previous
     contrast study.  Duodenal stent identified as it courses through a large
     pancreatic mass measuring over 12 cm in diameter. A 3-cm hypodense lesion
     likely metastasis is present within the spleen. The kidneys enhance and
     excrete normally. Again, evaluation of the mid abdomen is compromised
     secondary to marked artifact from condensed previous contrast in the left
     colon. Anasarca of the soft tissues is noted.  Small bowel loops are normal
     caliber.

     INDICATION:  82-year-old woman with pancreatic carcinoma and gastric outlet
     obstruction with questionable biliary obstruction status post plastic stent in
     the common bile duct several months ago, now septic.
     
     COMPARISON:  ERCP from [**3465-9-1**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contrast enhanced CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was
     reviewed.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  Multiple small 3- to 5-mm pulmonary nodules are
     identified in both lungs, no comparison is available.  Ill-defined patchy
     ground-glass opacities are also present in both lungs.  A very small right
     pleural effusion is present.  There is evidence for at least one metastatic
     lesion in the liver that measures 7 mm in the right lobe.  A 1.3 cm cyst is
     present within the left lobe.  Near the dome of the liver is another area of
     possible metastatic standing, moderate ascites is present around the liver.
     Intrahepatic bile ducts are dilated measuring up to 9 mm in diameter.
     Pneumobilia is also present.  Common bile ducts may dilate further just
     superior to the common bile duct stent, though this is somewhat limited given
     artifact from the stent and dense contrast in the left colon from a previous
     contrast study.  Duodenal stent identified as it courses through a large
     pancreatic mass measuring over 12 cm in diameter. A 3-cm hypodense lesion
     likely metastasis is present within the spleen. The kidneys enhance and
     excrete normally. Again, evaluation of the mid abdomen is compromised
     secondary to marked artifact from condensed previous contrast in the left
     colon. Anasarca of the soft tissues is noted.  Small bowel loops are normal
     caliber.

     HISTORY:  Pancreatic cancer.  Biliary obstruction.  Cholangitis.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3070**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 397**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 397**] was present
     throughout the procedure and supervising.
     
     FINDINGS/TECHNIQUE:  The patient was appropriately consented, placed supine on
     the angiographic table, and prepped.  General anesthesia was established by
     the anesthesia team.  1% lidocaine was also administered and a 21-gauge Chiba
     needle was advanced into the liver parenchyma.  Multiple passes were made
     until cannulation of the left intrahepatic duct was achieved.  Contrast was
     then injected, and a cholangiogram was performed.  The cholangiogram
     demonstrated mild dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary tree with moderate-
     to-severe dilatation of proximal common bile duct. The distal CBD was not
     opacified. An additional 21- gauge Chiba needle was advanced under
     fluoroscopic guidance into one of the opacified peripheral branches of the
     right intrahepatic bile duct. A successful cannulation of the duct was
     confirmed when a 0.018 Glidewire was advanced into the bile duct. An inner
     dilator of the Accustick system was then advanced over the Glidewire and the
     Glidewire was exchanged for a stiff 0.018 mandril wire, which was placed into
     the common bile duct. The inner dilator of the Accustick system was removed
     and then the outer sheath of the Accustick system was advanced into the common
     bile duct as the metallic stylet was removed. 0.018-guidewire was removed, and
     a cholangiogram was again performed injecting large amount of contrast slowly
     via the Accustick introducer. Cholangiogram demonstrated again marked
     dilatation of the proximal common bile duct with an abrupt large filling
     defect showing an apple core appearance and surrounding the in situ plastic
     stent previously placed by the gastroenterologist. A small amount of contrast
     passed via the metallic stent into the duodenum. A Wallstent was visualized in
                                                                 (Over)

     the duodenum, its distal extent crossing the ampulla where the distal tip of
     the plastic stent was located. A Glidewire 0.035 was then introduced into the
     Accustick introducer and advanced through the common bile duct into the
     duodenum.  The Accustick introducer was exchanged for 7-French bright tip
     angiographic introducer sheath and a curved guiding catheter 4- French was
     advanced over the wire via the angiographic introducer sheath into the
     duodenum.  The Glidewire was exchanged for a super stiff exchange length
     Amplatz wire, and the guiding catheter was removed.  A 10 mm by 94 mm
     Wallstent deployment device was then advanced over the wire and positioned at
     the level of the common bile duct stenosis.  The stent was deployed extending
     with its distal tip into the duodenum and with its proximal tip close to the
     bifurcation of the common bile duct.  The stent deployment device was then
     exchanged for a 8 mm x 4 cm angiographic balloon angioplasty catheter with
     subsequent balloon dilatation of the deployed stent.  The balloon angiographic
     catheter was removed and contrast was injected via the 7-French introducer
     sheath confirming patency of the newly deployed Wallstent.  The angiographic
     introducer sheath was then exchanged over the wire for a 8-French biliary
     drain forming its end pigtail in the duodenum.  The external internal biliary
     drain was secured to the skin with 0 silk stitch and StatLock device.  Sterile
     dressing was applied.  The catheter was capped.
     
     The patient was extubated on the table by the anesthesia team and transported
     to the ICU in the same condition as before the procedure.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Percutaneous cholangiogram demonstrated mildly distended intrahepatic
     biliary ducts and severely distended proximal common bile duct with a large
     filling defect occupying most of the common bile duct and extending to the
     ampulla.  The in situ plastic stent previously placed by gastroenterology was
     demonstrated within the filling defect in the common bile duct.  A plastic
     stent was partially obstructed.
     
     2.  10 mm by 94 mm Wallstent was placed across the stenotic common bile duct
     extending from the bifurcation of the common bile duct to the duodenum.  Post
     deployment balloon dilatation of the stent with 8 mm balloon catheter was
     performed.
     
     3.  An external internal biliary drain was left in place extending from the
     peripheral branch of the right intrahepatic biliary duct into the duodenum.
     The biliary drain was capped for internal drainage.

     the plastic stent was located. A Glidewire 0.035 was then introduced into the
     Accustick introducer and advanced through the common bile duct into the
     duodenum.  The Accustick introducer was exchanged for 7-French bright tip
     angiographic introducer sheath and a curved guiding catheter 4- French was
     advanced over the wire via the angiographic introducer sheath into the
     duodenum.  The Glidewire was exchanged for a super stiff exchange length
     Amplatz wire, and the guiding catheter was removed.  A 10 mm by 94 mm
     Wallstent deployment device was then advanced over the wire and positioned at
     the level of the common bile duct stenosis.  The stent was deployed extending
     with its distal tip into the duodenum and with its proximal tip close to the
     bifurcation of the common bile duct.  The stent deployment device was then
     exchanged for a 8 mm x 4 cm angiographic balloon angioplasty catheter with
     subsequent balloon dilatation of the deployed stent.  The balloon angiographic
     catheter was removed and contrast was injected via the 7-French introducer
     sheath confirming patency of the newly deployed Wallstent.  The angiographic
     introducer sheath was then exchanged over the wire for a 8-French biliary
     drain forming its end pigtail in the duodenum.  The external internal biliary
     drain was secured to the skin with 0 silk stitch and StatLock device.  Sterile
     dressing was applied.  The catheter was capped.
     
     The patient was extubated on the table by the anesthesia team and transported
     to the ICU in the same condition as before the procedure.
     
     IMPRESSION:

     ampulla.  The in situ plastic stent previously placed by gastroenterology was
     demonstrated within the filling defect in the common bile duct.  A plastic
     stent was partially obstructed.
     
     2.  10 mm by 94 mm Wallstent was placed across the stenotic common bile duct
     extending from the bifurcation of the common bile duct to the duodenum.  Post

     HISTORY:  Pancreatic cancer.  Biliary obstruction.  Cholangitis.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3070**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 397**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 397**] was present
     throughout the procedure and supervising.
     
     FINDINGS/TECHNIQUE:  The patient was appropriately consented, placed supine on
     the angiographic table, and prepped.  General anesthesia was established by
     the anesthesia team.  1% lidocaine was also administered and a 21-gauge Chiba
     needle was advanced into the liver parenchyma.  Multiple passes were made
     until cannulation of the left intrahepatic duct was achieved.  Contrast was
     then injected, and a cholangiogram was performed.  The cholangiogram
     demonstrated mild dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary tree with moderate-
     to-severe dilatation of proximal common bile duct. The distal CBD was not
     opacified. An additional 21- gauge Chiba needle was advanced under
     fluoroscopic guidance into one of the opacified peripheral branches of the
     right intrahepatic bile duct. A successful cannulation of the duct was
     confirmed when a 0.018 Glidewire was advanced into the bile duct. An inner
     dilator of the Accustick system was then advanced over the Glidewire and the
     Glidewire was exchanged for a stiff 0.018 mandril wire, which was placed into
     the common bile duct. The inner dilator of the Accustick system was removed
     and then the outer sheath of the Accustick system was advanced into the common
     bile duct as the metallic stylet was removed. 0.018-guidewire was removed, and
     a cholangiogram was again performed injecting large amount of contrast slowly
     via the Accustick introducer. Cholangiogram demonstrated again marked
     dilatation of the proximal common bile duct with an abrupt large filling
     defect showing an apple core appearance and surrounding the in situ plastic
     stent previously placed by the gastroenterologist. A small amount of contrast
     passed via the metallic stent into the duodenum. A Wallstent was visualized in
                                                                 (Over)

     the anesthesia team.  1% lidocaine was also administered and a 21-gauge Chiba
     needle was advanced into the liver parenchyma.  Multiple passes were made
     until cannulation of the left intrahepatic duct was achieved.  Contrast was
     then injected, and a cholangiogram was performed.  The cholangiogram
     demonstrated mild dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary tree with moderate-
     to-severe dilatation of proximal common bile duct. The distal CBD was not
     opacified. An additional 21- gauge Chiba needle was advanced under
     fluoroscopic guidance into one of the opacified peripheral branches of the
     right intrahepatic bile duct. A successful cannulation of the duct was
     confirmed when a 0.018 Glidewire was advanced into the bile duct. An inner
     dilator of the Accustick system was then advanced over the Glidewire and the
     Glidewire was exchanged for a stiff 0.018 mandril wire, which was placed into
     the common bile duct. The inner dilator of the Accustick system was removed
     and then the outer sheath of the Accustick system was advanced into the common
     bile duct as the metallic stylet was removed. 0.018-guidewire was removed, and
     a cholangiogram was again performed injecting large amount of contrast slowly
     via the Accustick introducer. Cholangiogram demonstrated again marked
     dilatation of the proximal common bile duct with an abrupt large filling
     defect showing an apple core appearance and surrounding the in situ plastic
     stent previously placed by the gastroenterologist. A small amount of contrast
     passed via the metallic stent into the duodenum. A Wallstent was visualized in
                                                                 (Over)

     the plastic stent was located. A Glidewire 0.035 was then introduced into the
     Accustick introducer and advanced through the common bile duct into the
     duodenum.  The Accustick introducer was exchanged for 7-French bright tip
     angiographic introducer sheath and a curved guiding catheter 4- French was
     advanced over the wire via the angiographic introducer sheath into the
     duodenum.  The Glidewire was exchanged for a super stiff exchange length
     Amplatz wire, and the guiding catheter was removed.  A 10 mm by 94 mm
     Wallstent deployment device was then advanced over the wire and positioned at
     the level of the common bile duct stenosis.  The stent was deployed extending
     with its distal tip into the duodenum and with its proximal tip close to the
     bifurcation of the common bile duct.  The stent deployment device was then
     exchanged for a 8 mm x 4 cm angiographic balloon angioplasty catheter with
     subsequent balloon dilatation of the deployed stent.  The balloon angiographic
     catheter was removed and contrast was injected via the 7-French introducer
     sheath confirming patency of the newly deployed Wallstent.  The angiographic
     introducer sheath was then exchanged over the wire for a 8-French biliary
     drain forming its end pigtail in the duodenum.  The external internal biliary
     drain was secured to the skin with 0 silk stitch and StatLock device.  Sterile
     dressing was applied.  The catheter was capped.
     
     The patient was extubated on the table by the anesthesia team and transported
     to the ICU in the same condition as before the procedure.

     biliary ducts and severely distended proximal common bile duct with a large

     demonstrated within the filling defect in the common bile duct.  A plastic
     stent was partially obstructed.
     
     2.  10 mm by 94 mm Wallstent was placed across the stenotic common bile duct
     extending from the bifurcation of the common bile duct to the duodenum.  Post

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      82 year old woman with pancreatic cancer, biliary and gastric obstruction, gram 
      negative bacteremia
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      drainage for biliary sepsis                                                     
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     HISTORY:  Pancreatic cancer.  Biliary obstruction.  Cholangitis.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3070**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 397**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 397**] was present
     throughout the procedure and supervising.
     
     FINDINGS/TECHNIQUE:  The patient was appropriately consented, placed supine on
     the angiographic table, and prepped.  General anesthesia was established by
     the anesthesia team.  1% lidocaine was also administered and a 21-gauge Chiba
     needle was advanced into the liver parenchyma.  Multiple passes were made
     until cannulation of the left intrahepatic duct was achieved.  Contrast was
     then injected, and a cholangiogram was performed.  The cholangiogram
     demonstrated mild dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary tree with moderate-
     to-severe dilatation of proximal common bile duct. The distal CBD was not
     opacified. An additional 21- gauge Chiba needle was advanced under
     fluoroscopic guidance into one of the opacified peripheral branches of the
     right intrahepatic bile duct. A successful cannulation of the duct was
     confirmed when a 0.018 Glidewire was advanced into the bile duct. An inner
     dilator of the Accustick system was then advanced over the Glidewire and the
     Glidewire was exchanged for a stiff 0.018 mandril wire, which was placed into
     the common bile duct. The inner dilator of the Accustick system was removed
     and then the outer sheath of the Accustick system was advanced into the common
     bile duct as the metallic stylet was removed. 0.018-guidewire was removed, and
     a cholangiogram was again performed injecting large amount of contrast slowly
     via the Accustick introducer. Cholangiogram demonstrated again marked
     dilatation of the proximal common bile duct with an abrupt large filling
     defect showing an apple core appearance and surrounding the in situ plastic
     stent previously placed by the gastroenterologist. A small amount of contrast
     passed via the metallic stent into the duodenum. A Wallstent was visualized in
                                                                 (Over)

     the duodenum, its distal extent crossing the ampulla where the distal tip of
     the plastic stent was located. A Glidewire 0.035 was then introduced into the
     Accustick introducer and advanced through the common bile duct into the
     duodenum.  The Accustick introducer was exchanged for 7-French bright tip
     angiographic introducer sheath and a curved guiding catheter 4- French was
     advanced over the wire via the angiographic introducer sheath into the
     duodenum.  The Glidewire was exchanged for a super stiff exchange length
     Amplatz wire, and the guiding catheter was removed.  A 10 mm by 94 mm
     Wallstent deployment device was then advanced over the wire and positioned at
     the level of the common bile duct stenosis.  The stent was deployed extending
     with its distal tip into the duodenum and with its proximal tip close to the
     bifurcation of the common bile duct.  The stent deployment device was then
     exchanged for a 8 mm x 4 cm angiographic balloon angioplasty catheter with
     subsequent balloon dilatation of the deployed stent.  The balloon angiographic
     catheter was removed and contrast was injected via the 7-French introducer
     sheath confirming patency of the newly deployed Wallstent.  The angiographic
     introducer sheath was then exchanged over the wire for a 8-French biliary
     drain forming its end pigtail in the duodenum.  The external internal biliary
     drain was secured to the skin with 0 silk stitch and StatLock device.  Sterile
     dressing was applied.  The catheter was capped.
     
     The patient was extubated on the table by the anesthesia team and transported
     to the ICU in the same condition as before the procedure.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Percutaneous cholangiogram demonstrated mildly distended intrahepatic
     biliary ducts and severely distended proximal common bile duct with a large
     filling defect occupying most of the common bile duct and extending to the
     ampulla.  The in situ plastic stent previously placed by gastroenterology was
     demonstrated within the filling defect in the common bile duct.  A plastic
     stent was partially obstructed.
     
     2.  10 mm by 94 mm Wallstent was placed across the stenotic common bile duct
     extending from the bifurcation of the common bile duct to the duodenum.  Post
     deployment balloon dilatation of the stent with 8 mm balloon catheter was
     performed.
     
     3.  An external internal biliary drain was left in place extending from the
     peripheral branch of the right intrahepatic biliary duct into the duodenum.
     The biliary drain was capped for internal drainage.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      82 year old woman with pancreatic cancer and cholangitis                        
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please remove ext/int drain

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  82-year-old woman with pancreatic cancer and cholangitis.  The
     patient had a right-sided percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD)
     and placement of a metallic common bile duct (CBD) stent last week.  The
     patient's bilirubin has normalized to the level of 1.1. The patient has a
     white blood cell count of 8.4 and has been afebrile.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 914**] [**Name (STitle) 915**] and [**Doctor First Name 132**] [**Doctor Last Name 107**] d'Othee with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 107**]
     [**Name (STitle) 108**], the attending radiologist, present and supervising during the
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  Following written informed consent, the patient was
     positioned supine on the angiography table.  A preprocedure timeout was
     performed to confirm patient, procedure and site.  Standard sterile prep and
     drape of the right side of the abdomen and in situ biliary drainage catheter.
     The retaining suture was cut and the catheter was cut to release the locking
     loop. A 0.035-inch guidewire was advanced through the catheter into the
     duodenum using fluoroscopic guidance.  The in situ catheter was removed.  A 7-
     French [**Last Name (un) 3306**]-tip vascular sheath was placed over the guidewire into the
     intrahepatic biliary tree.  Cholangiography was performed through the sheath
     demonstrating nondilated intrahepatic bile ducts with mild central biliary
     ductal dilation. The superior aspect of the common duct is dilated.  The in
     situ plastic CBD stent is opacified throughout its length with contrast and
     appears patent. There has been partial in-stent restenosis of metallic CBD
     stent.  There is some flow of contrast from the intrahepatic biliary tree
     through the metallic stent into the bowel.  Overall, there is drainage of the
     intrahepatic biliary tree into the bowel.
     
     However, based on the findings of the diagnostic cholangiogram, it was
     determined that it likely was not prudent to remove the internal-external
     biliary drainage catheter at this time.  Prior to removal of the internal-
     external biliary drainage catheter a repeat angioplasty of the common bile
     duct and extension of the common duct stent more superiorly could be of use.
     This case will be discussed with the Clinical Service.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     Given the findings of the diagnostic cholangiogram, a new 8-French internal-
     external biliary drainage catheter was placed over the guidewire and the
     guidewire was removed. The locking loop was formed in the duodenum.  The most
     superior sidehole was positioned within the intrahepatic biliary tree.  The
     catheter was sutured in place with an 0 silk suture and fixated with a
     StatLock device. A sterile dressing was applied.  The catheter was capped as
     there was appropriate internal drainage.  If the patient experiences any signs
     of cholangitis, jaundice or increasing bilirubin, then the catheter can be
     uncapped and attached to straight bag drainage.
     
     IMPRESSION:  The intrahepatic biliary tree does drain to the bowel through the
     in situ stents.  The plastic common bile duct stent appears patent.  The
     metallic stent has partial in-stent restenosis.  Based on the findings of the
     diagnostic cholangiogram it was determined that removal of the internal-
     external biliary drainage catheter is likely not prudent at this time.

     The retaining suture was cut and the catheter was cut to release the locking
     loop. A 0.035-inch guidewire was advanced through the catheter into the
     duodenum using fluoroscopic guidance.  The in situ catheter was removed.  A 7-
     French [**Last Name (un) 3306**]-tip vascular sheath was placed over the guidewire into the
     intrahepatic biliary tree.  Cholangiography was performed through the sheath
     demonstrating nondilated intrahepatic bile ducts with mild central biliary
     ductal dilation. The superior aspect of the common duct is dilated.  The in
     situ plastic CBD stent is opacified throughout its length with contrast and
     appears patent. There has been partial in-stent restenosis of metallic CBD
     stent.  There is some flow of contrast from the intrahepatic biliary tree
     through the metallic stent into the bowel.  Overall, there is drainage of the
     intrahepatic biliary tree into the bowel.
     
     However, based on the findings of the diagnostic cholangiogram, it was
     determined that it likely was not prudent to remove the internal-external
     biliary drainage catheter at this time.  Prior to removal of the internal-
     external biliary drainage catheter a repeat angioplasty of the common bile
     duct and extension of the common duct stent more superiorly could be of use.
     This case will be discussed with the Clinical Service.

     Given the findings of the diagnostic cholangiogram, a new 8-French internal-
     external biliary drainage catheter was placed over the guidewire and the
     guidewire was removed. The locking loop was formed in the duodenum.  The most
     superior sidehole was positioned within the intrahepatic biliary tree.  The
     catheter was sutured in place with an 0 silk suture and fixated with a
     StatLock device. A sterile dressing was applied.  The catheter was capped as
     there was appropriate internal drainage.  If the patient experiences any signs
     of cholangitis, jaundice or increasing bilirubin, then the catheter can be
     uncapped and attached to straight bag drainage.
     
     IMPRESSION:  The intrahepatic biliary tree does drain to the bowel through the
     in situ stents.  The plastic common bile duct stent appears patent.  The
     metallic stent has partial in-stent restenosis.  Based on the findings of the

     duodenum using fluoroscopic guidance.  The in situ catheter was removed.  A 7-
     French [**Last Name (un) 3306**]-tip vascular sheath was placed over the guidewire into the
     intrahepatic biliary tree.  Cholangiography was performed through the sheath
     demonstrating nondilated intrahepatic bile ducts with mild central biliary
     ductal dilation. The superior aspect of the common duct is dilated.  The in
     situ plastic CBD stent is opacified throughout its length with contrast and
     appears patent. There has been partial in-stent restenosis of metallic CBD
     stent.  There is some flow of contrast from the intrahepatic biliary tree
     through the metallic stent into the bowel.  Overall, there is drainage of the
     intrahepatic biliary tree into the bowel.
     
     However, based on the findings of the diagnostic cholangiogram, it was
     determined that it likely was not prudent to remove the internal-external
     biliary drainage catheter at this time.  Prior to removal of the internal-
     external biliary drainage catheter a repeat angioplasty of the common bile
     duct and extension of the common duct stent more superiorly could be of use.
     This case will be discussed with the Clinical Service.

     Given the findings of the diagnostic cholangiogram, a new 8-French internal-
     external biliary drainage catheter was placed over the guidewire and the
     guidewire was removed. The locking loop was formed in the duodenum.  The most
     superior sidehole was positioned within the intrahepatic biliary tree.  The
     catheter was sutured in place with an 0 silk suture and fixated with a
     StatLock device. A sterile dressing was applied.  The catheter was capped as
     there was appropriate internal drainage.  If the patient experiences any signs
     of cholangitis, jaundice or increasing bilirubin, then the catheter can be
     uncapped and attached to straight bag drainage.
     
     IMPRESSION:  The intrahepatic biliary tree does drain to the bowel through the
     in situ stents.  The plastic common bile duct stent appears patent.  The
     metallic stent has partial in-stent restenosis.  Based on the findings of the
     diagnostic cholangiogram it was determined that removal of the internal-
     external biliary drainage catheter is likely not prudent at this time.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  82-year-old woman with pancreatic cancer and cholangitis.  The
     patient had a right-sided percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD)
     and placement of a metallic common bile duct (CBD) stent last week.  The
     patient's bilirubin has normalized to the level of 1.1. The patient has a
     white blood cell count of 8.4 and has been afebrile.

     [**Name (STitle) 108**], the attending radiologist, present and supervising during the
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  Following written informed consent, the patient was
     positioned supine on the angiography table.  A preprocedure timeout was
     performed to confirm patient, procedure and site.  Standard sterile prep and
     drape of the right side of the abdomen and in situ biliary drainage catheter.
     The retaining suture was cut and the catheter was cut to release the locking
     loop. A 0.035-inch guidewire was advanced through the catheter into the
     duodenum using fluoroscopic guidance.  The in situ catheter was removed.  A 7-
