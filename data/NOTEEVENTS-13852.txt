Admission Date:  [**2699-1-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2699-1-20**]

Date of Birth:   [**2617-7-14**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This patient was transferred from an
outside hospital for cardiac catheterization, where his chief
complaint had been shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 9727**] is an 81-year-old
white male with a past medical history significant for
hypertension, benign prostatic hypertrophy, and a remote
tobacco history, who was in generally good health with no
known coronary artery disease, and presented to an outside
hospital with acute shortness of breath the night prior to
admission while sitting and watching television.  He stated
that his shortness of breath worsened with ambulation and
other activity.  He denied having any associated chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, palpitations, or diaphoresis.  He was taken
to the Emergency Department of the outside hospital, where an
EKG done showed poor R wave progression in leads V1 through
V3.  Cardiac enzymes were cycled and showed a troponin of
39.21, and a CK of 246.  At this time he was transferred to
the coronary care unit at the outside hospital, where a chest
x-ray was found to be consistent with congestive heart
failure.  The patient received a 40 mg intravenous dose of
Lasix, and responded with a 1,200 cc diuresis.  He was
started on heparin, aspirin, a beta blocker and an ACE
inhibitor.  The heparin was however discontinued secondary to
some mild hematuria.  He continued to remain symptom free,
and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 391**] for cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Hypertension.  2. Gout.  3.
Hypercholesterolemia.  4. Remote history of kidney stones.
5. Benign prostatic hypertrophy with normal biopsy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1. Univasc 15 mg p.o. q.d.  2.
Allopurinol 300 mg p.o. q.d.  3. Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Hydrochlorothiazide.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies..

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 9727**] has a 20-pack-year smoking
history, but quit smoking approximately 20 years before.  He
denies any alcohol or other illicit drug use.  He lives with
his son in [**Name2 (NI) 4080**] and is a retired employee of [**Company **]
[**Male First Name (un) 9214**] Company.

FAMILY HISTORY:  His mother and sister both passed away in
their 70s secondary to coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission Mr. [**Known patient lastname 9727**] was a pleasant
elderly man in no acute distress.  He was found to have a
temperature of 98.1 degrees, heart rate of 78 and sinus
rhythm, blood pressure 178/90, respiratory rate 18 and an
oxygen saturation on room air of 95%.  His pupils were
equally reactive to light and accommodation and his
extraocular movements were intact.  His neck was supple with
jugular venous distension at approximately 8 cm, 2+ palpable
carotid pulses with no bruits.  His cardiac examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2, as
well as a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.  He did not have any
S3, S4 or rubs.  His lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  His abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended
with no hepatosplenomegaly or other palpable masses.  His
extremities were warm and dry, with minimal bilateral pedal
edema.  He had 2+ palpable pedal pulses.  Neurologically he
was alert and oriented  to person, place and time, with 5/5
strength and sensation in both upper and lower extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission his complete blood count was
significant for a white blood cell count of 9.9, hematocrit
44 and a platelet count of 188.  Chem-7 showed a sodium of
136, potassium 3.9, chloride 99 and a bicarbonate of 29, BUN
and creatinine of 46 and 1.8, and a blood glucose of 154.
His prostate specific antigen at the time of admission was
18.  At the outside hospital he was found to have successive
troponins of 39.2 and 47.1 as well as a CK of 246.  His
initial PT and PTT were 12.2 and 31.8, and at the time that
his heparin was stopped due to hematuria his PTT was 91.5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 9727**] was accepted as a transfer from
[**Hospital3 708**], and admitted to the cardiac catheterization
laboratory.  While there, he was found to have a left
ventricular ejection fraction estimated to be 20-25%.  He was
also found to have distal 40% occlusion of his left main
coronary artery, subtotal occlusion of the left anterior
descending artery, proximal 70% focal disease as well as
distal occlusion of the left circumflex artery, and a
proximal 70% occlusion of the obtuse marginal artery.  The
patient tolerated his catheterization well, and was
subsequently transferred to the floor in stable condition.

On hospital day two, through various discussions with his
family and the cardiac surgery service, the patient decided
to proceed with coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.

On hospital day two the patient was restarted on heparin at
which time he redeveloped hematuria.  The urology service was
subsequently consulted to further evaluate this issue.  He
underwent flexible cystoscopy which revealed a likely
prostatic source to his gross hematuria.  The heparin drip
was restarted and a three-way Foley catheter was placed so
that he could have continuous bladder irrigation to keep his
urine clear.  Follow up was arranged with the urology service
as an outpatient in the future once his cardiac issues have
been resolved.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 9727**] was taken to the operating room on [**2699-1-13**] where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 3.
Please refer to the dictated operative note for full details
of his procedure.  The patient tolerated the procedure well,
and was transferred in stable condition to the cardiac
surgery recovery unit.  At the time of transfer, he was found
to have a mean arterial pressure of 72, being A-paced at 80
beats per minute.  He was on a milrinone drip at 0.25 mcg per
kg per minute as well as a propofol drip at 10 mcg per kg per
minute.  Following arrival in the CSRU, the patient
subsequently required a small dose of Levophed to maintain a
mean arterial pressure in the 60s.  He also received two
units of packed red blood cells for an hematocrit of 24.6,
and was found to have a post transfusion hematocrit of 25.6.

On postoperative day one the patient was reversed, weaned
from the ventilator, and successfully extubated.  He was
weaned off of his milrinone and Levophed drips, continuing
only on an insulin drip at approximately two units per hour.
He continued at this time to have continuous bladder
irrigation through his three-way Foley catheter.

In the days following extubation, the patient did require
intermittent milrinone to maintain his cardiac index.  At
this time diuresis was also started with Lasix with excellent
response.  Levofloxacin was also started for treatment of a
urinary tract infection.

On postoperative day four, the patient was weaned off
milrinone altogether, received one unit of blood for an
hematocrit of 27%, and captopril was slowly titrated up.  At
this time, he was deemed stable and ready for transfer to the
floor.  Continuous bladder irrigation had been stopped, and
urine draining into the Foley catheter was tea colored.

On transfer to the floor, the patient initially had a large
oxygen requirement, requiring six liters of nasal cannula
oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations above 95%.  This was
slowly weaned, as he improved, and diuresis continued.  He
continued to improve as well in terms of functional mobility
in his therapy sessions with the physical therapy service.

His Foley catheter was discontinued on [**1-19**] which was
postoperative day six, and the patient was initially able to
void, though in small amounts.  By lateral that night, the
patient became uncomfortable and was subsequently unable to
void.  A three-way Foley catheter was replaced, and 800 cc of
clear yellow urine as well as one large blood clot drained
into the Foley catheter.

On postoperative day seven, it was felt that the patient was
stable and ready for discharge from a cardiopulmonary
standpoint.  It was felt at this time that he would benefit
from a short stay at an extended care rehabilitation
facility.  It was also deemed necessary at this time that the
Foley catheter, which was placed on the night prior to
discharge remain in place for approximately 1-2 weeks with
outpatient urology follow up.

Physical examination on discharge:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 9727**] was found to
have a temperature of 99.1 degrees with a heart rate of 78 in
sinus rhythm and a blood pressure of 120/56.  He had an
oxygen saturation on room air of approximately 92%, but
continued to require some nasal cannula oxygen for activity.
He continued to diurese well at this time.  His neck was
supple with no abnormalities.  On cardiac examination he had
a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 and a grade
2/6 systolic ejection murmur.  His lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  His sternal incision was healing
nicely with no erythema or drainage, and his sternum was
stable.  His abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, with
no organomegaly or other probable masses.  He had a three-way
Foley catheter in place with a small amount of fresh blood
around the penile meatus.  His extremities were warm and well
perfused with minimal lower extremity edema.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. x 7 days.
3. Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. x 7 days.
4. Captopril 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.
5. Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6. Zantac 150 mg p.o. q. day.
7. Trazodone 100 mg p.o. q.h.s. for [**Doctor Last Name 292**].
8. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q. 4 hours as needed for pain or
discomfort.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass
grafting x 3.
2. Hypertension.
3. Gout.
4. Hypercholesterolemia.
5. Benign prostatic hypertrophy with hematuria, and failure
to void following surgery.

The patient is being discharged with a three-way Foley
catheter in place.  His activity should be as tolerated,
though he requires continued sessions with physical therapy
to increase strength, mobility and endurance.  During this
time he should slowly be weaned from his nasal cannula oxygen
requirement with activity.  His diet should be a cardiac
heart healthy diet.

FOLLOW UP:  He will follow up with his cardiologist in
approximately one to two weeks, with the wound clinic in
approximately two weeks.  He should also follow up with Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1142**] in approximately four weeks' time.  Follow up
should also be with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of the Urology Department at
[**Hospital1 10**] in approximately one to
two weeks' time, phone #[**Telephone/Fax (1) 9728**].

     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      81 year old man with hematuria of unclear etiology.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      81M with hematuria, acute myocardial infarction, pre-op now for coronary bypass
      surgery.  Needs CT-Abd+pelvis with delayed images and 3mm cuts.  We are looking
      for a tumor (esp. bladder/ureter tumor) as cause of the hematuria.
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Hematuria, evaluate for bladder/ureter tumor.
     
     Reference is made to the patient's renal ultrasound from [**2699-1-10**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis from the lung bases through
     the pubic symphysis were aquired helically before and after the administration
     of 150 cc of Optiray contrast, used secondary to the patient's history of
     debility.   There were no adverse reactions to contrast administration.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Multiple calcified pleural plaques are present.
     Study is limited by patient motion.  No liver lesions are identified.  The
     spleen, adrenal glands, pancreas, gallbladder, stomach, and intraabdominal
     loops of bowel are within normal limits.  Several small, nonpathologically
     enlarged paraaortic lymph nodes are seen.  There is no ascites.  Both kidneys
     enhance symmetrically without evidence of obstruction.  Multiple simple renal
     cysts are present bilaterally.  No filling defects are present within either
     renal collecting system or ureter.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The distal ureters and bladder are unremarkable.
     The prostate is large, and slightly heterogeneous in enhancement.  Allowing
     for limitations due to patient movement, the distal large bowel and rectum are
     unremarkable.  There is no free fluid in the pelvis and no significant pelvic
     or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
     
     No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) No evdience of bladder or ureteral cancer.
     
     2) Multiple simple renal cysts bilaterally.
     
     These results were discussed with the clinical house staff at the time of
     interpretation.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CHEST AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW
     
     INDICATION:  Immediately out of O.R., S/P bypass surgery, not ventilating
     well.
     
     Evaluate for pulmonary status.
     
     FINDINGS:  Two exposures were made to cover entire thorax completely.  The
     patient is now S/P sternotomy and intubated the ETT with its tip some 4 cm
     above the carina.  An NG tube is present seen to reach far below the
     diaphragm.  A right jugular approach central venous line carries a Swan-Ganz
     catheter the tip of which reaches the level of the pulmonary valve.  Right-
     sided chest tube terminating just above the diaphragm and an additional
     mediastinal tube terminating at the level of the carina.  There is no evidence
     of pneumothorax.  Comparison is made with the previous pre-operative chest
     examination of [**2699-1-10**].  The previously described pleural plaques and rather
     sizable linear calcifications in the left diaphragm are unchanged in position
     with extension.  Pulmonary vasculature however has undergone interval changes
     characterized by marked perivascular haze bilaterally and in addition a small
     nodular confluenting densities in both lungs consistent with beginning
     pulmonary edema.  This somewhat atypical appearance can be explained by the
     patient's history of COPD.  Significant pleural effusions on this single AP
     view.
     
     No local infiltrates of pneumonia or aspiration type are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  No pneumothorax.
     
     2)  Pulmonary catheter in borderline position, suggests advancement by a few
     cm.
     
     3)  Increased perivascular haze in both lungs indicative of CHF or volume
     overload.  No conclusive evidence for local parenchymal infiltrates.

     FINDINGS: There is no intra or extraaxial hemorrhage. There is no mass effect
     or shift of normally midline structures. There is prominence of the
     ventricles, cisterns and sulci, which is likely secondary to age related
     involution. No large vascular territorial infarcts are identified. There is a
     small left cerebellar lacune.   There are dense callcifications of the
     carotid siphons.
     The visualized osseous structures and paranasal sinuses are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION: No infarct identified. If there is strong clinical suspicion for
     infarct, MRI with diffusion weighted imaging should be considered.

     three T fasteners were introduced in the stomach.  Position was confirmed
     after injection of approximately 30 cc of Optiray.  Using fluoroscopic
     guidance a 19 gauge needle was  introduced in the stomach.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 528**] wire was
     advanced to the stomach using fluoroscopic guidance.  A 5 french sheath was
     placed over the wire. A SOS Omni catheter was advanced over the wire and into
     the duodenum.  The wire was advanced to the proximal jejunum as well as the
     catheter.
     
     The [**Last Name (un) 528**] wire was removed and replaced with an Amplatz wire.
     
     The catheter and sheath were removed and a 12 french dilator was advanced to

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      81 year old man s/p CABG in 1/03, CHF, developed dysphagia while in rehab; now 
      NPO after failed video swallow test; needs PEG for nutrition and PO meds; pt 
      will be on NGT suction overnight tonight starting at midnight
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please place PEG                                                                
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: Status post CABG, failed video swallow test, needs GJ tube for
     nutrition.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4074**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 553**] [**Name (STitle) 250**], who was present and
     supervising during the entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE: The upper abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile
     fashion.  The stomach was distended with air.  Using fluoroscopic guidance
     three T fasteners were introduced in the stomach.  Position was confirmed
     after injection of approximately 30 cc of Optiray.  Using fluoroscopic
     guidance a 19 gauge needle was  introduced in the stomach.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 528**] wire was
     advanced to the stomach using fluoroscopic guidance.  A 5 french sheath was
     placed over the wire. A SOS Omni catheter was advanced over the wire and into
     the duodenum.  The wire was advanced to the proximal jejunum as well as the
     catheter.
     
     The [**Last Name (un) 528**] wire was removed and replaced with an Amplatz wire.
     
     The catheter and sheath were removed and a 12 french dilator was advanced to
     the stomach.  A 14 french sheat was placed in the stomach and a 14 french
     [**Doctor Last Name 939**] GJ tube was advanced over the wire, the tip in the jejunum.  The
     pigtail was coiled in the stomach.  Post procedure x-ray confirms the
     positioning of the catheter in the proximal jejunum.  The catheter was secured
     with a flexi-track.  Three sutures were performed at the insertion site.
     Medications include 75 mcg of fentanyl, 1.5 mg Versed and 1 g of _____.
     Catheter is ready for immediate use.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 14 french [**Doctor Last Name 939**] GJ tube placed with tip
     in the jejunum.  Catheter ready for use.
                                                                 (Over)

     The heart again shows slight left ventricular enlargement and there is
     evidence of CABG surgery.  The pulmonary vessels are normal and there is no
     evidence to indicate cardiac failure at this time. Multuple scattered pleural
     calcifications are again noted on both sides as well as above the diaphragm.
     No new pulmonary infiltrates or effusions are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Stable cardiopulmonary appearances.  No acute infiltrates or
     failure.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
       81 year old man s/p recent CABG with BPH, here from rehab for dysphagia (had  
      failed barium swallow), now dx with [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 4076**] [**Last Name (un) 247**] on therapy.  Please 
      re-evaluate.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      r/o aspiration, ability to swallow                                              
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dysphagia secondary to [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 247**], now on therapy.
     This is a re-evaluation.
     
     The study was performed in conjunction with the Speech/Swallow therapist, who
     provided oral boluses of variuous consistencies for swallow.
     
     FINDINGS:  The oral phase was notable for minimal premature spill.  There is
     mild delay of initiation of swallow.  A lack of epiglottic deflection was
     noted, particularly with thin consistencies with spill past the epiglottis to
     the pyriform sinuses.  Persistent vallecular residue was seen and with
     pudding, there was trace penetration of vallecular residue.  The vallecular
     residue of the thicker consistencies was noted to clear with thin liquids.  No
     aspiration was witnessed.  The patient attempted to swallow a tablet, which
     became trapped in the vallecula and the patient was unable to swallow and
     eventually coughed the pill back up.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Overall improvement since the prior study with persistence of delayed
     initiation of swallow and decreased epiglottic deflection with thinner
     consistencies.  Vallecular residue with trace penetration of the larynx was
     seen.

     FINDINGS: Single AP supine view. Comparison study taken 4 hours earlier. A new
     right IJ central line has been inserted. Its tip is well positioned in the mid
     SVC. There is now a large right pneumothorax, estimated to be approximately
     60% by volume. This is associated with some shift of the heart and mediastinum
     to the right. The right hemidiaphragm is also lowered slightly. Elsewhere, the
     appearances are unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION: A large right pneumothorax is demonstrated, complicating the
     placement of the left IJ central line.

     all remain in satisfactory positions.  The extent of the surgical emphysema
     over the right chest wall is unchanged.  The patchy pleural calcified plaques
     are again noted and unchanged.  The heart shows LV enlargement, and there is
     evidence of prior CABG procedure.  These findings are essentially unchanged
     since the earlier study.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No significant changes since prior study.  There is no evidence
     of definite pneumonic consolidation or pneumothorax.

     AP SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is a moderate-sized pneumothorax at the
     right base on the supine chest radiograph.  Compared to the prior study, this
     is slightly improved.  There is a chest tube at the right base.  Again seen is
     significant subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall, presumably related
     to the chest tube insertion.  There is a right IJ line whose tip is at the
     distal SVC.  An ETT is identified in satisfactory position.  There is
     continued collapse/consolidation of the left lower lobe.  There are
     calcifications within the aorta.
     
     There are surgical clips in the mediastinum, however, mediastinal sternal
     wires seen on prior chest radiograph up to [**2699-2-14**] have been removed

     CLINICAL INDICATION: 81-year-old male with recent CABG, now with an
     erythematous and unstable sternum. Evaluate for fluid collection within the
     mediastinum.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to
     the pubic symphysis without intravenous contrast.
     
     COMPARISON: CT from [**2699-1-11**].
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is moderate sized soft tissue
     collection within the mediastinum which contains a small focus of gas. There
     is suggestion of bony resorption adjacent to this collection. Of note, the
     sternum does not appear to be well apposed, a finding concerning for sternal
     dehiscence. This mediastinal collection could represent mediastinitis given
     the patient's clinical history. However, these findings could also be
     attributed to postoperative changes. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are
     present. There is a small right pneumothorax. A right-sided chest tube is in
     place and is associated with subcutaneous air. There is mild pericardial
     thickening, likely secondary to recent surgical intervention.
     
     CT OF THE ADBOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: A PEG tube is in place within the
     stomach. Allowing for the limitations of a noncontrast study, the liver,
     spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys appear grossly
     normal. Two simple cysts are present within each kidney bilaterally. The
     stomach and opacified loops of large and small bowel are unremarkable. No
     abnormal fluid collections are present within the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Pelvic loops of bowel appear grossly
     normal. The liver and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is enlargement of
     the prostate gland. No free fluid is present within the pelvis.
     
     BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION: Soft tissue collection within the mediastinum adjacent to the
     sternum associated with poor apposition of the sternal bones and questionable
     bony resorption. In the appropriate clinical setting, these findings could
     suggest mediastinitis with sternal dehiscence.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INDICATION: 81-year-old male with recent CABG, now with an
     erythematous and unstable sternum. Evaluate for fluid collection within the
     mediastinum.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to
     the pubic symphysis without intravenous contrast.
     
     COMPARISON: CT from [**2699-1-11**].
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is moderate sized soft tissue
     collection within the mediastinum which contains a small focus of gas. There
     is suggestion of bony resorption adjacent to this collection. Of note, the
     sternum does not appear to be well apposed, a finding concerning for sternal
     dehiscence. This mediastinal collection could represent mediastinitis given
     the patient's clinical history. However, these findings could also be
     attributed to postoperative changes. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are
     present. There is a small right pneumothorax. A right-sided chest tube is in
     place and is associated with subcutaneous air. There is mild pericardial
     thickening, likely secondary to recent surgical intervention.
     
     CT OF THE ADBOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: A PEG tube is in place within the
     stomach. Allowing for the limitations of a noncontrast study, the liver,
     spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys appear grossly
     normal. Two simple cysts are present within each kidney bilaterally. The
     stomach and opacified loops of large and small bowel are unremarkable. No
     abnormal fluid collections are present within the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Pelvic loops of bowel appear grossly
     normal. The liver and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is enlargement of
     the prostate gland. No free fluid is present within the pelvis.
     
     BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION: Soft tissue collection within the mediastinum adjacent to the
     sternum associated with poor apposition of the sternal bones and questionable
     bony resorption. In the appropriate clinical setting, these findings could
     suggest mediastinitis with sternal dehiscence.

     TECHNIQUE:   Contiguous axial images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to
     the femoral heads without intravenous contrast.
     
     Comparison is made with a prior CT from [**2699-2-15**], as well as multiple

     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The endotracheal tube is in appropriate
     position.  Multiple surgical clips and skin staples are identified from recent
     CABG.  There is a JP drain within the left anterior chest wall.  This drain is
     within a large heterogenous collection that also contains bubbles of air. This
     likely represents a hematoma.  There is also a lesser extent of hematoma in
     the right anterior chest wall.  This is a new finding from the prior CT and
     likely related to the patient's pectoral flaps.  There is also extensive
     subcutaneous emphysema, more so on the right than on the left.  This also
     appears to be increased from the prior CT.  There is also increased
     attenuation in the previously identified substernal collection.  There are
     numerous, mildly prominent nodes in the mediastinum which may be reactive in
     nature.  There is a right-sided chest tube which extends towards the right
     lung base.  There is also a new left-sided chest tube which extends towards
     the apex.  Heavy vascular calcifications are again noted.  There is a fragment
     in appearance of the sternum, and the sternal wires have been removed.
     
     Lung windows demonstrate a small pneumothorax in the anterior and apical
     regions.  There is also a tiny left pneumothorax seen anteriorly and at the

     COMPARISON:  [**2699-2-23**] at 18:42.
     
     Compared to the study of two hours prior, there has been interval placement of
     a new left-sided chest tube with its tip in the left upper lung zone. The
     patient had a CT scan on [**2699-2-23**] at 21:15.  The left basilar pneumothorax seen
     on the CT is not seen on this chest x-ray. The right chest tube is in stable
     position in the right lower lung zone.  The previously seen right apical
     pneumothorax is again seen with no change.  There is extensive subcutaneous
     emphysema on the right, unchanged from the prior study.  Again seen are two
     left-sided chest drains, unchanged in position.  There is an ET tube in stable
     position. There is a left subclavian line whose tip is in the mid SVC.  Again
     seen are pleural plaques and bilateral pulmonary opacities, unchanged from the
     prior study.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Interval placement of a left-sided chest tube. The left basilar
     pneumothorax seen on recent CT is not seen on this chest x-ray.
     
     2. Persistent right apical pneumothorax, no change.
     
     3. Stable position of ET tube and left subclavian line.

     Question pneumothorax/hemothorax.
     
     TECHNIQUE:   Single portable AP view of the chest is compared with 5 hours
     prior.
     
     FINDINGS:  Again seen is an endotracheal tube in suitable position 5 cm from
     the carina.  There is an unchanged position of a left-sided subclavian
     catheter in the lower SVC. There are again two left-sided [**Location (un) 4093**]-[**Location (un) 4094**] drains
     over the thorax.  There has been interval removal of a right IJ catheter.
     Again seen is a right-sided basilar chest tube. There is unchanged extensive
     right-sided subcutaneous emphysema. An area of increased lucency at the right
     apex may represent an apical pneumothorax, unchanged from prior exam. However,
     extensive subcutaneous emphysema of the right hemithorax obscures detail.
     There is a diffusely increased opacity of the left hemithorax compared to the
     prior study of five hours ago. A pleural plaque is present at the left lung
     base, and several other smaller pulmonary opacities are seen, unchanged from
     the prior study.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  ? Persistent left apical pneumothorax. Details obscured by SQ emphysema.
     2.  Stable position of endotracheal tube, left subclavian catheter, left JP
     drains, and right chest tube.
     3.  Interval removal or right IJ catheter.
     4.  Haziness of left hemithorax may reflect pleural effusion or relatively
     increased aeration of the right hemithorax due to pneumothorax.
     
     Findings discussed with covering PA at the time of interpretation.

     PORTABLE CHEST: Comparison is made to study from 2 hours earlier. The ETT and
     right IJ catheter are in stable position. A left subclavian catheter has been
     placed with the tip in the superior vena cava. The cardiac and mediastinal
     contours are normal. There is persistent subcutaneous emphysema, predominantly
     over the right hemithorax. Increased conspicuity of the right lateral margin
     of the ascending aorta suggests an anteromedial pneumothorax. There is no
     pneumothorax on the left. There is a thoracostomy tube at the right lung base.
     Calcified pleural plaques are again noted.

     CLINICAL INDICATION: 81-year-old male with mediastinitis status post
     laparotomy, now with fevers and leukocytosis.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained from the thoracic inlet
     through the pubic syphysis following the administration of 150 cc of Optiray.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The previously described mediastinal soft
     tissue mass appears smaller in size. However, it continues to be associated
     with erosion of the adjacent sternum. Several prevascular and paratracheal
     lymph nodes are evident. The lungs demonstrate moderate sized pleuaral
     effusions, right greater than left. These are associated with compression
     atelectasis of the adjacent lung parenchyma. The heart and great vessels are
     grossly normal. Note is made of extensive calcifications involving the left
     main, LAd, circumflex, and diagonal-1 coronary arteries.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas,
     and adrenal glands are grossly normal. Bilateral renal cysts are again
     demonstrated. A feeding tube is seen which enters through the stomach and
     terminates within the jejunum. No abnormal fluid collections are present
     within the abdomen. Specifically, there is no lesser sac abscess. The
     opacified loops of small and large bowel appear grossly normal.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The pelvic loops of small and large bowel
     are unremarkable. Urinary bladder and distal ureters are grossly normal. There
     is a sizeable prostate. Small amount of free fluid is present within the
     pelvis.

     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The previously described mediastinal soft
     tissue mass appears smaller in size. However, it continues to be associated
     with erosion of the adjacent sternum. Several prevascular and paratracheal
     lymph nodes are evident. The lungs demonstrate moderate sized pleuaral
     effusions, right greater than left. These are associated with compression
     atelectasis of the adjacent lung parenchyma. The heart and great vessels are
     grossly normal. Note is made of extensive calcifications involving the left
     main, LAd, circumflex, and diagonal-1 coronary arteries.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas,
     and adrenal glands are grossly normal. Bilateral renal cysts are again
     demonstrated. A feeding tube is seen which enters through the stomach and
     terminates within the jejunum. No abnormal fluid collections are present
     within the abdomen. Specifically, there is no lesser sac abscess. The
     opacified loops of small and large bowel appear grossly normal.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The pelvic loops of small and large bowel
     are unremarkable. Urinary bladder and distal ureters are grossly normal. There
     is a sizeable prostate. Small amount of free fluid is present within the
     pelvis.
     
     IMPRESSION: No evidence of abscess.

     SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST, 1 VIEW:  Comparison [**2699-3-4**].  Since the prior
     exam the patient has been intubated with ETT 4 cm above the carina.  There is
     a left subclavian line with tip in the inferior SVC.  No pneumothorax is
     noted.  There are diaphragmatic calcifications and pleural calcifications,
     consistent with prior asbestos exposure.  There are bilateral patchy alveolar
     opacities, right greater than left.  These are slightly improved at the left
     base and slightly worse in the right upper lobe, since the prior exams.  This
     pattern of interval change suggests that these are related to pulmonary edema.
     There are small bilateral pleural effusions.

     tracheostomy placement. Check position and rule out pneumothorax.
     
     FINDINGS: A single AP supine view. Comparison study dated [**2699-3-5**]. A
     tracheostomy tube has been inserted, replacing the previous endotracheal tube.
     It appears to be in good position. There is again evidence of some cardiac
     enlargement, mainly left vetricular. The right lung shows patchy pulmonary
     infiltrates, essentially unchanged. There is again evidence of
     collapse/consolidation of the left lower lobe behind the heart. A less severe
     infiltrate is noted in the left upper lobe. A pleural calcification is
     demonstrated above the left diaphragm. There is again evidence of blunting of
     the right costophrenic angle consistent with a small effusion on this side.
     
     IMPRESSION: Extensive pulmonary infiltrates in the right lung and left upper
     lobe are again noted. There is also left lower lobe collapse/consolidation.
     Persistent right pleural effusion and left pleural calcification. Satisfactory
     placement of new tracheostomy tube.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Acute tachypnea and tachycardia, rule out PE.
     
     Patient has a history of CABG with prior sternal infection.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2699-2-23**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases through the pulmonary apices after the administration of 100 cc of
     intravenous Optiray due to the fast bolus rate required for the study.
     Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.
     
     CTA OF THE CHEST:  No pulmonary emboli are identified.  There is no axillary
     adenopathy.  Small non-pathologically-enlarged lymph nodes are seen in the
     mediastinum, likely related to the patient's acute processes.  There is a
     small pericardial effusion.  Bilateral small pleural effusions are present.
     There is associated bibasilar compressive atelectasis.  There is coronary
     artery disease and atherosclerotic changes of the aorta.  On lung windows,
     there are patchy opacities in the right upper lobe posteriorly with associated
     peribronchial thickening and emphysematous changes.  This could be due to
     atelectasis vs. an early infection.  There is a nodular component to this area
     more inferiorly.  There are bilateral calcified pleural plaques.
     
     There is interval improvement of the soft-tissue stranding and fluid
     collection overlying the sternum.  There is a JP drain in place.  There is
     slight increased distraction between the sternal bones.  There is a small
     amount of residual gas within the sternal soft tissues.  A tracheostomy is in
     place.  A central venous line is seen entering from the left.  Its tip is not
     identified due to dense contrast surrounding it.  The imaged portion of the
     upper abdomen is within normal limits.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) No pulmonary emboli.
     
     2) Improved appearance to the soft-tissue infection of the sternum with
     residual gas.
     
     3) Interval slight increased retraction between the sternal fragments.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
         81 year old man s/p CABG w/ erythematous/unstable  sternum                   
           
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      acute tachypnia/tachycardia-r/o PE                                              
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Acute tachypnea and tachycardia, rule out PE.
     
     Patient has a history of CABG with prior sternal infection.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2699-2-23**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases through the pulmonary apices after the administration of 100 cc of
     intravenous Optiray due to the fast bolus rate required for the study.
     Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.
     
     CTA OF THE CHEST:  No pulmonary emboli are identified.  There is no axillary
     adenopathy.  Small non-pathologically-enlarged lymph nodes are seen in the
     mediastinum, likely related to the patient's acute processes.  There is a
     small pericardial effusion.  Bilateral small pleural effusions are present.
     There is associated bibasilar compressive atelectasis.  There is coronary
     artery disease and atherosclerotic changes of the aorta.  On lung windows,
     there are patchy opacities in the right upper lobe posteriorly with associated
     peribronchial thickening and emphysematous changes.  This could be due to
     atelectasis vs. an early infection.  There is a nodular component to this area
     more inferiorly.  There are bilateral calcified pleural plaques.
     
     There is interval improvement of the soft-tissue stranding and fluid
     collection overlying the sternum.  There is a JP drain in place.  There is
     slight increased distraction between the sternal bones.  There is a small
     amount of residual gas within the sternal soft tissues.  A tracheostomy is in
     place.  A central venous line is seen entering from the left.  Its tip is not
     identified due to dense contrast surrounding it.  The imaged portion of the
     upper abdomen is within normal limits.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) No pulmonary emboli.
     
     2) Improved appearance to the soft-tissue infection of the sternum with
     residual gas.
     
     3) Interval slight increased retraction between the sternal fragments.
                                                                 (Over)

     5) Emphysematous changes in the pulmonary apices and focal subtle
     peribronchial thickening and nodular changes which could represent atelectasis
     vs. early pneumonia.

     INDICATION: Sepsis.  Evaluate for source.
     
     COMPARISON: CT torso [**2699-3-1**]
     
     TECHNIQUE: Multiple axial images from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis
     were obtained following the administration of oral contrast.  IV contrast was
     not used due to renal failure.  Coronal reformats were obtained.
     
     ABDOMEN: There are moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions with dependent
     atelectasis.  Small amount of ascites anterior to the liver is uncahnged in
     the interval.  The liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unchanged.
     The gallbladder contains higher density material than on the previous exam
     which is of uncertain significance.  Again noted are multiple bilateral renal
     cysts.  Contrast material is still evident within the renal parenchyma and the
     collecting systems, consistent with known acute renal failure.  There is no
     fluid within the paracolic gutters.  There is no free air.  There is new wall
     thickening within the ascending colon and several loops of small bowel.  The
     bowel is normal in caliber.
     
     PELVIS: A Foley catheter is present within the bladder.  There is no free
     pelvic fluid or air.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.
     
     Coronal reformats demonstrate calcified pleural thickening on the left.
     Percutaneous feeding tube is noted extending into the jejunum.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Interval increase in density of gallbladder bile without definite vicarous
     excretion of contrast or signs of cholecystitis.
     2) Slight  bowel wall thickening which may be related to patient's known C-
     difficile colitis.
     
     Findings were discussed with the general surgery team at the time of the exam.

     COMPARISON:  [**2699-3-9**] at 21:37.
     
     FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube remains in place. There is a right Swan-Ganz with
     the tip in the right pulmonary outflow tract.  Bilateral effusions are stable.
      Accounting for technical differences, I see no definite evidence for new
     consolidation.  Cardiac silhouette appears slightly larger, but there is a
     shallower level of inspiration.
     
     There is increase in left retrocardiac density, but this could be
     projectional.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Probably no significant change, accounting for technical differences.  Left
     lower lobe air space disease could be present.

     COMPARISON:  [**2699-3-12**].
     
     PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST:  The PA catheter has been exchanged for a central
     venous line, the tip of which is difficult to visualize but appears to be in
     the proximal RA.  No pneumothorax.  There is mild cardiomegaly. There is a
     tracheostomy tube place. There are multifocal patchy opacities with increased
     haziness over both lung fields.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
     There is an area of increased opacity in the left retrocardiac region.
     Multiple calcified pleural plaques are seen, the largest along the left
     hemidiaphragm.  A feeding tube overlies the upper abdomen.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Multifocal opacities, not significantly changed since the
     previous study, and probably related to CHF.
     
     Small bilateral pleural effusions.
     
     Left retrocardiac density may be related to effusion and atelectasis.  A
     pneumonic process at the left base cannot be excluded.

     INDICATIONS:  Erythematous and unstable sternum, assess for fluid
     collections/source of infection.
     
     Comparison was made to the chest CT from [**2699-3-9**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the chest were acquired helically from the lung
     apices through the lung bases with 100 cc of Optiray contrast.  Non-ionic
     contrast was used secondary to the patient's allergy history.  There were no
     adverse reactions to contrast administration.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  Numerous mediastinal lymph nodes are
     present which do not meet size criteria for pathological enlargement by CT. No
     pathologically-enlarged axillary or hilar lymph nodes are seen.  The aorta is
     densely calcified, but is unchanged in appearance.  Bilateral pleural
     effusions are slightly larger, with an associated increase in the amount of
     bibasilar and lingular atelectasis.  Again identified are bilateral areas of
     calcified pleural plaque.  No new pneumonic consolidations are present.  The
     sternal fluid collection is essentially unchanged in size.  It demonstrates
     less internal gas.  Also noted is intraabdominal fluid around the liver and
     spleen, which demonstrates Hounsfield Units below that of blood, and which was
     not present on the prior chest CT.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Increasing bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.  No new pneumonic
     consolidations.
     
     2) Stable sternal fluid collection, with less internal air vs. prior.
     
     3) New intraabdominal fluid, likely ascites by Hounsfield Units.
     
     These results were discussed with the internal medicine housestaff at the time
     of interpretation.

     apices through the lung bases with 100 cc of Optiray contrast.  Non-ionic
     contrast was used secondary to the patient's allergy history.  There were no
     adverse reactions to contrast administration.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  Numerous mediastinal lymph nodes are
     present which do not meet size criteria for pathological enlargement by CT. No
     pathologically-enlarged axillary or hilar lymph nodes are seen.  The aorta is
     densely calcified, but is unchanged in appearance.  Bilateral pleural
     effusions are slightly larger, with an associated increase in the amount of
     bibasilar and lingular atelectasis.  Again identified are bilateral areas of
     calcified pleural plaque.  No new pneumonic consolidations are present.  The
     sternal fluid collection is essentially unchanged in size.  It demonstrates
     less internal gas.  Also noted is intraabdominal fluid around the liver and
     spleen, which demonstrates Hounsfield Units below that of blood, and which was
     not present on the prior chest CT.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Increasing bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.  No new pneumonic
     consolidations.
     
     2) Stable sternal fluid collection, with less internal air vs. prior.
     
     3) New intraabdominal fluid, likely ascites by Hounsfield Units.
     
     These results were discussed with the internal medicine housestaff at the time
     of interpretation.
     
     
                                                                 (Over)

     subclavian line terminates at the SVC-atrial junction.  The heart is enlarged.
      Small bilateral pleural effusions are probably not significantly changed,
     allowing for differences in position.  Calcific pleural plaques are noted.
     Haziness of the pulmonary vessels is consistent with CHF.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Persistent pattern of CHF.  Overall, the appearance is not
     significantly changed compared to the [**3-18**] exam.

      Rule out infiltrates.
     
     SINGLE VIEW CHEST:  Comparison is made to the prior study of [**2699-3-22**].
     The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Again noted is a
     tracheostomy tube and central venous catheter, in appropriate position.  The
     NG tube extends into the stomach.  There is increased opacity in the left
     retrocardiac region and pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There is also
     evidence for bronchiectasis bilaterally.  There is a small left pleural
     effusion. The right costophrenic angle is not included on this study. Again
     noted is diffuse haziness of the pulmonary vasculature, consistent with CHF.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Findings consistent with CHF, not significantly changed.
     2)  Persistent left retrocardiac opacity.  
     3)  Probable bronchiectasis and chronic bronchitis.

     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE: No suitable superficial veins were present at initial

     vein. Under ultrasonographic guidance a micropuncture needle is used to gain
     access to the left brachial vein. An .018 wire is advanced into the superior
     vena cava under fluoroscopic observation and the micropuncture needle is
     exchanged for a peelaway sheath. The .018 guidewire is measured and it is
     determined that 47 cm length would be appropriate. PICC catheter is trimmed to
     this length. The PICC is then advanced under fluoroscopic guidance over a .018
     guidewire and through the peelaway sheath. Subsequent chest radiograph
     demonstrates proper positioning of PICC with tip at distal superior vena cava.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Wound infection long-term antibiotics bedside PICC unable to be
     placed by IV team.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Procedure performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 997**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 602**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 603**], staff
     radiologist, supervising procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE: No suitable superficial veins were present at initial
     examination. Ultrasonography demonstrates a patent compressible left brachial
     vein. Under ultrasonographic guidance a micropuncture needle is used to gain
     access to the left brachial vein. An .018 wire is advanced into the superior
     vena cava under fluoroscopic observation and the micropuncture needle is
     exchanged for a peelaway sheath. The .018 guidewire is measured and it is
     determined that 47 cm length would be appropriate. PICC catheter is trimmed to
     this length. The PICC is then advanced under fluoroscopic guidance over a .018
     guidewire and through the peelaway sheath. Subsequent chest radiograph
     demonstrates proper positioning of PICC with tip at distal superior vena cava.
     The catheter is demonstrated to flush and aspirate well and is StatLocked in
     position. There are no immediate complications. The patient tolerated the
     procedure well.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of 5 Fr double lumen PICC via left brachial
     vein with tip at SVC. The catheter is [**Doctor Last Name **] for use.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
                                     81 year old man with cad s/p cabg;    and pec  
      flap         closure     now with tachypnea and fever
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      assess lung fields, low pao2's                                                  
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Fever and tachypnea.
     
     PORTABLE CHEST:  Comparison is made to prior films, the most recent dated
     [**2699-4-8**].
     
     A tracheostomy tube and central venous catheter remain in position.  A
     catheter of some type projects over the upper mid-abdomen, not seen
     previously, and a second linear opacity projects over the left base without
     change.  There is less good evaluation of midline structures due to rotation.
     Previously noted diffuse interstitial edema with associated effusions
     persist, largely without change.
     
     There appears to be worsened aeration at the right base today, although it is
     uncertain to what extent this reflects differences in patient positioning. The
     possibility of new focal infiltrate here cannot be entirely excluded.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1.  Persistent interstitial edema and bilateral pleural effusions.
     2.  Possible new infiltrate right base.

     Portable chest of 4/15 compared to three days earlier.
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Tachypnea and fever.
     
     A tracheostomy tube remains in place as well as a right subclavian vascular
     catheter.  The heart is enlarged but stable in size.  There is some pulmonary
     vascular engorgement, as well as perihilar haziness present.  There remains
     dense opacification in the left retrocardiac region.  Bilateral small pleural
     effusions persist, and note is also made of underlying bilateral calcified
     pleural plaques.
     
     As compared to the recent study, an area of more confluent opacity in the
     right lower lobe appears improved in the interval.  Bilateral pleural
     effusions may also be slightly improved but differences in patient positioning
     limit the comparison.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Improvement in previously-reported confluent right lower lobe opacity.
     
     2) Persistent congestive heart failure and bilateral pleural effusions.
     
     3) Calcified pleural plaques, consistent with prior asbestos exposure.
