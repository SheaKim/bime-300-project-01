Date of Birth:   [**3072-4-23**]       Sex:  M

Service:  BLUE SURGERY
PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 47-year-old male from [**Country 9076**] presented
with pruritus, nausea, diarrhea, ACOG stools and jaundice.
An endoscopy and CT scan performed in [**Country 9076**] approximately
one year ago showed leiomyoma of the stomach.  On [**7-30**], the patient presented at [**Hospital 9077**] Hospital Medical
intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts.  No extrahepatic
disease was seen.  An endoscopy at the outside institution
showed a mass along the duodenum involving the ampulla of
Vater.  Pathology of that mass revealed invasive moderately
well differentiated adenocarcinoma.  An ERCP was done at that
time and a stent was placed.  The patient was transferred to
the [**Hospital6 273**] for surgical

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hepatitis A as a child.

1.  Tegretol for facial numbness.
2.  Atarax 25 mg q4h prn itch
3.  Periactin 4 mg po bid
4.  Ciprofloxacin 500 mg po bid with two remaining doses
5.  Vicodin prn

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Two glasses of wine per day, smoking a pack
per day since age 15, quit two months ago.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 99.4��, heart rate 88, blood
pressure 118/64, respiratory rate 16.
GENERAL:  He was jaundiced.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Scleral icterus.
COR:  Regular rate and rhythm.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, no
hepatosplenomegaly appreciated.  No edema.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Hematocrit was 40.3.  Sodium
139, potassium 4.1, chloride 100, bicarbonate 26, BUN 20,
creatinine 0.9, glucose 111, AST 64, ALT 64, alkaline
phosphatase 147, bilirubin 10.4, amylase 46.  CEA is 3.0 and
CA19-9 was 15.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient went to the Operating Room on
[**8-8**] and had a pylorus bearing Whipple performed.
At this time, a cholecystectomy was performed as well.  A
replaced right hepatic artery injured during the procedure
and a gastroduodenal artery interposition graft was placed.
Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the floor for
surgical care.  There, his hematocrits were stable.  He had a
temperature spike and those original cultures were negative.
He was placed on subcutaneous heparin for prophylaxis, as
well as on Protonix.  His pain was controlled with
intravenous Dilaudid PCA.  The patient continued to do well
until [**8-11**] where he was noted to have some
tachycardia and abdominal pain.  CT scan was done which
revealed a large intraabdominal hematoma.

On [**8-12**], the patient was brought back to the
Operating Room, had an exploratory laparotomy and evacuation
of an intraabdominal clot.  During this procedure, there was
a small bowel enterotomy which was repaired.  After that
surgery, the patient's hematocrit continued to remain stable.
Cultures from the Operating Room revealed [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.
The patient was started on fluconazole at that time.
Multiple ultrasounds were obtained of the liver which
revealed good flow in the right and left hepatic arteries.
The patient's cultures continued to be followed and a repeat
CT scan was obtained on [**8-16**].  There was a moderate
fluid collection.  He started to grow out gram negative rods
and micrococcus.  At that point, he was started on Zosyn and
vancomycin.  Due to increased JP output, JP amylase was sent
and this revealed a value of 29,000.

Repeat ultrasounds were obtained which revealed a small
amount of peritoneal fluid and no loculated fluid
collections.  JP fluid was again sent off on [**8-21**]
which revealed a bilirubin of 12.1 and an amylase of 4,040.
CT scan showed a large amount of fluid in the pelvis.  It was
decided the patient should be started on octreotide on
[**8-21**].  The patient was also started on total
parenteral nutrition.  This was originally started on
[**8-12**] and continued throughout his admission.  It
was decided to bring the patient back to the Operating Room
on [**8-22**] as he continued to have persistent fever
spikes and the above noted findings on CT scan.

Procedure performed was an exploratory laparotomy and the
findings at the time were intraabdominal hematoma with a
breakdown of the pancreaticojejunal anastomosis.  At that
time, the jejunum was oversewed and a portion of the skin
incision was left open and a portion was closed with Marlex
mesh.  The patient remained stable and on his antibiotics of
Zosyn, fluconazole and vancomycin.  The TPN was continued.
The patient was then brought back to the Operating Room on
[**8-29**] to remove the Marlex mesh and perform a wound
debridement.  The wound was then closed with a Marlex mesh.
The patient was transferred to the floor for surgical care
for this.  His repeat cultures revealed no growth.  He was
essentially on the floor for a 10 day period of time where he
was receiving wet to dry dressing changes to the skin
incision.  The Marlex mesh was used to close the fascia.

The patient was doing well until [**9-8**] where he was
found to be in extremis.  A code was called and he was in PEA
for a short period of time where he was given epinephrine and
atropine.  He then regained a pulse and was tachycardic to
140s and his blood pressures were in the 70s.  He was brought
emergently to the Operating Room where an exploratory
laparotomy was performed.  No definitive ...............
bleeding was performed, though a large amount of
intraabdominal clot was evacuated.  His hematocrits continued
to drop and on [**9-9**] he was brought to angiogram where
it was revealed that there was extravasation from the right
hepatic artery.  Three coils were placed.  The patient
received large amounts of packed red blood cells and FFP
transfusion during this time for continued dropped
hematocrits.  After his first angiogram, his [**Location (un) 767**]-[**Location (un) 1527**]
drain continued to have large amounts of sanguinous output.
He was returned to angiogram where an additional coil was
placed in the right hepatic artery as extravasation was seen.

After this procedure he was stable for a short period of time
until another liter of blood was seen in his [**Location (un) 767**]-[**Location (un) 1527**]
drains.  He was brought back down to the angiography suite
early on the morning of [**9-10**].  It was very difficult
to cannulate his right hepatic artery and the intervention at
the time was relatively unsuccessful.  He was transferred
back to the Intensive Care Unit where his hematocrits kept
dropping.  His acidosis progressively worsened.  At that
time, a family meeting was held with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1695**] and the
patient's family.  It was decided that the patient should be
made comfort measures only.  All support was removed at
approximately 4 a.m. on [**9-10**].  The patient expired at
approximately 5:15 on the morning of [**9-10**].  A
postmortem will be obtained.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post Whipple for adenocarcinoma of ampulla of
Vater which was moderately well differentiated and invasive.
2.  Prolonged hospitalization course complicated by four
return trips to the Operating Room and three trips to the
angiography suite.  The patient expired on [**9-10**].

     INDICATION:  Hypotension and drop in hematocrit in patient four days s/p
     Whipple procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases through the pubic symphysis without the administration of IV
     contrast.  IV contrast was withheld due to elevated creatinine.
     
     Comparison is made to the preoperative study of [**3119-8-6**].
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with
     associated atelectasis new since the prior study.
     
     There is a collection inferior and medial to the liver anterior to the
     pancreatic stump and surgical drain which contains both fluid density mixed
     with high density material suggestive of an active bleed and clotted blood.
     This collection measures approximately 5.5 X 11.5 cm in the axial dimension. A
     second collection located posterior and inferior to the pancreatic stump in
     the retroperitoneum contains a hematocrit level and likely represents a
     somewhat less acute bleed.  This second collection measures approximately 9.4
     X 4.2 cm in the axial dimension.  A large collection of simple fluid is
     present in the left subphrenic region around the spleen and tracks throughout
     the peritoneum.  One or two small air bubbles are noted within the peritoneum
     and are likely post surgical in nature.
     
     This noncontrast study provides suboptimal imaging of the organs of the upper
     abdomen.  There is, however, persistence of dilated intrahepatic biliary ducts
     which are notable to be absent of air, a finding that would be expected in a
     post Whipple patient.  This suggests there may be some compression upon the
     biliary anastomosis resulting in obstruction.  The spleen, post Whipple
     pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable.
     
     CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  A large amount of simple fluid is seen within
     the pelvis with no evidence of hemorrhagic components.  The urinary bladder is
     collapsed and a Foley catheter is in place.  There is no lymphadenopathy.
     
     No osseous abnormalities are seen.

     findings consistent with active and recent hemorrhage.

     PORTABLE CHEST:  Comparison is made to previous films from  [**3119-8-13**] performed
     at 12:30 hours.  There are bilateral pleural effusions.  There is also
     bibasilar atelectasis. There is diffuse ascites.  The nasogastric tube is seen
     terminating in the region of the gastroesophageal junction, side hole is
     definitively within the esophagus. Further advancement could be performed for
     more optimal positioning.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Nasogastric tube terminating in the region of GE junction, further
     advancement would place it in the more optimal position.
     
     2.  Bibasilar atelectasis with associated pleural effusions left greater than
     right.
     
     3.  Ascites.

     COMPARISON:  [**3119-8-12**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiple helically acquired axial images were obtained from the
     abdomen and pelvis following administration of IV contrast.
     
     CONTRAST:  150 cc of Optiray were administered secondary to patient debility.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  In the visualized portion of the lung bases there
     are bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.  There are no
     masses or pneumothoraces seen.  The visualized portion of the heart and
     pericardium are unremarkable.
     
     There is mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation and there is also biliary air
     seen.  There is an area of hypoattenuation seen in the inferior aspect of the
     right lobe of the liver consistent with possible infarction.  There is free
     fluid seen throughout the abdomen.  There is a right-sided drain seen entering
     the abdomen which extends up into the surgical bed.  The patient is status
     post Whipple's.  There is a loop of jejunum seen anastomosed to the stomach.
     Contrast is seen within the afferent limb of the bowel loop which is also
     slightly fluid-filled. There is contrast seen in the inferior portion of the
     bowel which is nondilated.  There has been a slight increase in the free fluid
     seen in the right paracolic gutter.  There is a small peripheral wedge-shaped
     hypodensity seen in the spleen which could represent an infarct. The adrenal
     glands are unremarkable.  The pancreatic head and uncinate process are not
     seen and the remaining portion of the pancreas is connected to the afferent
     limb of bowel.  Both kidneys contain multiple hypodensities which are most
     consistent with small kidney cysts.  There are multiple skin staples seen
     overlying the midportion of the anterior abdominal wall.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Again noted is free fluid throughout the
     pelvis.  The visualized portion of the bowel in the pelvis is not dilated.
     There is no free air or lymphadenopathy seen in the pelvis.  There is a Foley
     catheter in the bladder which is collapsed and cannot be fully evaluated.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  47 year old male with a history of duodenal cancer status post
     Whipple's procedure now postop day 4 with decreased hematocrit.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3119-8-12**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiple helically acquired axial images were obtained from the
     abdomen and pelvis following administration of IV contrast.
     
     CONTRAST:  150 cc of Optiray were administered secondary to patient debility.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  In the visualized portion of the lung bases there
     are bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.  There are no
     masses or pneumothoraces seen.  The visualized portion of the heart and
     pericardium are unremarkable.
     
     There is mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation and there is also biliary air
     seen.  There is an area of hypoattenuation seen in the inferior aspect of the
     right lobe of the liver consistent with possible infarction.  There is free
     fluid seen throughout the abdomen.  There is a right-sided drain seen entering
     the abdomen which extends up into the surgical bed.  The patient is status
     post Whipple's.  There is a loop of jejunum seen anastomosed to the stomach.
     Contrast is seen within the afferent limb of the bowel loop which is also
     slightly fluid-filled. There is contrast seen in the inferior portion of the
     bowel which is nondilated.  There has been a slight increase in the free fluid
     seen in the right paracolic gutter.  There is a small peripheral wedge-shaped
     hypodensity seen in the spleen which could represent an infarct. The adrenal
     glands are unremarkable.  The pancreatic head and uncinate process are not
     seen and the remaining portion of the pancreas is connected to the afferent
     limb of bowel.  Both kidneys contain multiple hypodensities which are most
     consistent with small kidney cysts.  There are multiple skin staples seen
     overlying the midportion of the anterior abdominal wall.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Again noted is free fluid throughout the
     pelvis.  The visualized portion of the bowel in the pelvis is not dilated.
     There is no free air or lymphadenopathy seen in the pelvis.  There is a Foley
     catheter in the bladder which is collapsed and cannot be fully evaluated.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There is no evidence for suspicious lytic or osseous lesions.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     IMPRESSION:
     1.   Bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.
     2.   Mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation with pneumobilia.
     3.   There is abdominal and pelvic free fluid seen with a right-sided
     abdominal Penrose drain in place.  The extent of the fluid collection has not
     changed significantly
     4. The patient is status post Whipple's with mildly dilated and fluid- filled
     afferent limb.  However no areas of stricture are identified and contrast is
     noted in the distal small bowel.
     5.   There is bilateral kidney simple cysts.
     6.   There is a wedge-shaped area of hypodensity seen in the spleen consistent
     with possible infarct and there is an area of hypodensity seen in the inferior
     portion of the right lobe of the liver.

     replaced right hepatic artery with gastroduodenal artery patch.  Worsening
     volume status.  Please assess right hepatic artery.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made to the patient's prior ultrasound of [**3119-8-14**].
     
     A limited right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed.  Normal blood flow is
     identified in the patient's right and left hepatic arteries.  The portal and
     hepatic veins also appear widely patent.  There is the suggestion of reversal
     of flow within the left portal vein.  However, evaluation was limited
     secondary to positioning of patient's bandages.  There is persistent
     intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Arterial flow documented in left and right hepatic arteries on
     this limited portable examination.  For complete evaluation of the hepatic
     vasculature, the patient should be evaluated in the ultrasound department when
     clinically stable.

     INDICATION:  Status post pyloric sparing Whipple procedure for duodenal CA.
     Fever and elevated white blood cell count.  Evaluate for collection/abscess.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases through the pubic symphysis following administration of 150 cc
     Optiray contrast IV.  Optiray contrast was utilized in light of patient's
     debility.
     
     COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to the patient's next prior CT dated [**3119-8-16**].
     CT OF ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are bilateral pleural effusions, left
     greater than right, with bibasilar atelectasis.  In the interval since the
     previous exam, there has been a slight decrease in the prominence of the
     intrahepatic bile ducts.  No pneumobilia is identified.  The patient is status
     post cholecystectomy.  Oral contrast has been administered via NG tube.  There
     is free extravasation of contrast into the peritoneal cavity, which appears to
     extend from the level of the gastrojejunostomy.  There is extensive high
     attenuation material consistent with hematoma in the region of the duodenal
     resection bed, which marked compresses the proximal jejunum.  The amount of
     hemorrhage present in this location has increased in size since the prior
     study.  There has also been an interval increase in hemorrhage within the
     mesentery.  There is a drain present, which extends from the patient's right
     mid abdomen superiorly into the subhepatic region.  This drain passes through
     a collection of hemorrhage in the right mid abdomen.  This collection in the
     right mid abdomen has not changed significantly since the prior study.  There
     are small pockets of air adjacent to the drain, as well as in a subhepatic
     location.  No frank extravasation of contrast is identified from the vascular
     structures.  There remains an area of low attenuation at the tip of the liver,
     not significantly changed.  Also not significantly is a small wedge-shaped
     area of low attenuation in the spleen, which could represent a small splenic
     infarct.  The oral contrast has passed freely through the bowel to the level
     of the mid small bowel.  There is a segment of jejunum that is distended and
     contains a filling defect, probably representing thrombus.  The degree of
     thrombus appears decreased since the patient's prior study.  The distal small
     bowel loops and colon are unremarkable with no evidence of bowel obstruction.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a large amount of fluid in the
     pelvis, increased since the previous exam.  This fluid demonstrates higher
     density in the dependent regions, consistent with sedimentation from
                                                                 (Over)

     1. Extravasation of oral contrast into the peritoneal cavity, likely from a
     leak at the patient's gastrojejunustomy.
     
     2. Interval increase in hematoma surrounding the proximal jejunum in the site
     of the prior doudenal resection.  This hematoma compresses the proximal
     jejunum quite markedly.  There is also an increase in hematoma in the left mid
     abdomen adjacent to proximal small bowel loops, as well as an increase in
     fluid in the pelvis.
     
     These results were telephoned immediately to the intern in the surgical ICU.

     CHEST
     
     No previous films are available for comparison due to computer updating.  The
     endotracheal tube is in the satisfactory position the cardiac size is not
     enlarged.  There is general opacification of the left lung suggesting a large
     effusion there is also some suggestion of air bronchograms behind the heart
     and I suspect the presence of a left lower lobe consolidation.  The right lung
     is clear but some haziness suggests the presence of a smaller effusion on this
     side.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Bilateral effusions probable left lower lobe infiltrate.

     INDICATION:  Patient is status post coil embolization of replaced right
     hepatic artery extravasation earlier today. The patient presents again with
     hemodynamic instability.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 132**] [**Name (STitle) 107**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **]'[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 127**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 106**], and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 127**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 215**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 107**] [**Name (STitle) **], staff radiologist, was present throughout the
     procedure.
     
     CONTRAST:  80 ml of Optiray 320 at 60%.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The left groin was again prepped and draped in
     a sterile fashion, and a 5 FR sheath was placed was accessed.  A 5 FR
     Omniflush catheter was placed in the distal thoracic aorta, and an AP
     aortogram was initially obtained to look for a possible source of bleeding
     other than from the replaced right hepatic artery.  No source was identified.
     Selective cannulation of the superior mesenteric artery was then performed
     with a C2 guide catheter, which documented further extravasation from the
     previously coiled right hepatic artery arising from the proximal superior
     mesenteric artery.  The remainder of the superior mesenteric artery is
     significantly vasoconstricted.
     
     Cannulation of the replaced right hepatic artery was then attempted, using
     various catheter--guidewire combinations.  Eventually, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3272**] 2 catheter
     was placed at the origin of the replaced right hepatic artery, and a 3 FR
     Tracker catheter was manipulated beyond the previously placed coils and into
     the mid portion of the vessel.  One 3 mm x 3 cm coil was then deployed under
     magnification fluoroscopic guidance.  No further coils could be placed due to
     the size of the vessel, was appeared vasoconstricted.  An arteriogram was
     performed following this coil embolization and documented no evidence for
     further extravasation.
     
     The [**Doctor Last Name 3272**] 2 catheter was then removed over a guidewire.  The left groin
     sheath was not removed, but rather placed to heparinized saline for patency.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Repeat superior mesenteric arteriogram again demonstrating active
     extravasation from the previously coiled replaced right hepatic artery. 3 mm x
     3 cm coil deployed, without evidence for further extravasation at this time.
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  Patient is status post coil embolization of replaced right
     hepatic artery extravasation earlier today. The patient presents again with
     hemodynamic instability.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 132**] [**Name (STitle) 107**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **]'[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 127**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 106**], and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 127**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 215**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 107**] [**Name (STitle) **], staff radiologist, was present throughout the
     procedure.
     
     CONTRAST:  80 ml of Optiray 320 at 60%.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The left groin was again prepped and draped in
     a sterile fashion, and a 5 FR sheath was placed was accessed.  A 5 FR
     Omniflush catheter was placed in the distal thoracic aorta, and an AP
     aortogram was initially obtained to look for a possible source of bleeding
     other than from the replaced right hepatic artery.  No source was identified.
     Selective cannulation of the superior mesenteric artery was then performed
     with a C2 guide catheter, which documented further extravasation from the
     previously coiled right hepatic artery arising from the proximal superior
     mesenteric artery.  The remainder of the superior mesenteric artery is
     significantly vasoconstricted.
     
     Cannulation of the replaced right hepatic artery was then attempted, using
     various catheter--guidewire combinations.  Eventually, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3272**] 2 catheter
     was placed at the origin of the replaced right hepatic artery, and a 3 FR
     Tracker catheter was manipulated beyond the previously placed coils and into
     the mid portion of the vessel.  One 3 mm x 3 cm coil was then deployed under
     magnification fluoroscopic guidance.  No further coils could be placed due to
     the size of the vessel, was appeared vasoconstricted.  An arteriogram was
     performed following this coil embolization and documented no evidence for
     further extravasation.
     
     The [**Doctor Last Name 3272**] 2 catheter was then removed over a guidewire.  The left groin
     sheath was not removed, but rather placed to heparinized saline for patency.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Repeat superior mesenteric arteriogram again demonstrating active
     extravasation from the previously coiled replaced right hepatic artery. 3 mm x
     3 cm coil deployed, without evidence for further extravasation at this time.
                                                                 (Over)

     was placed at the origin of the replaced right hepatic artery, and a 3 FR
     Tracker catheter was manipulated beyond the previously placed coils and into
     the mid portion of the vessel.  One 3 mm x 3 cm coil was then deployed under

     the size of the vessel, was appeared vasoconstricted.  An arteriogram was
     performed following this coil embolization and documented no evidence for
     further extravasation.
     
     The [**Doctor Last Name 3272**] 2 catheter was then removed over a guidewire.  The left groin
     sheath was not removed, but rather placed to heparinized saline for patency.

     INDICATION:  Patient is status post coil embolization of replaced right
     hepatic artery extravasation earlier today. The patient presents again with
     hemodynamic instability.

     Please assess blood clot seen on prior study.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Reference is made to the patient's most recent prior CT scan,
     from [**3119-8-22**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis from the lung bases through
     the pubic symphysis were acquired helically, with 150 cc of Optiray contrast.
     There were no adverse reactions to contrast administration.  Coronal
     reformatations were performed.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Bilateral pleural effusions are present
     with associated lung volume loss.  The overall size of the pleural effusions
     is increased.  There is an interval increase in the amount of intrahepatic
     biliary ductal dilatation, especially on the left.  There is disruption of the
     anterior abdominal wall with likely granulation tissue formation from prior
     surgical procedures.  The blood clot seen on prior studies has rather markedly
     enlarged.  The hematoma itself is seen best on coronal reconstructions.  The
     hematoma occupies most of the right mid-abdomen and extends superiorly to the
     subhepatic space.  In largest dimensions, the hematoma is 14 x 14 cm.  There
     are additional fluid pockets to the left of mid-line beneath granulation
     tissue which demonstrate an enhancing rind. Abundant soft tissue stranding is
     present adjacent to these fluid collections as well as adjacent to the
     hematoma. The remaining viable loops of small bowel are displaced inferiorly
     and laterally to the left, stretching the mesentery. An area of loculated
     contrast is present within the hematoma posteriorly, located anterior to the
     right kidney.  The hematoma causes mass effect on the right kidney.  The
     kidneys enhance symmetrically.  Multiple surgical drains are present within
     the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Displaced small bowel loops are present
     within the pelvis.  There is free fluid present within the pelvis with high
     attenuation.  A Foley catheter is demonstrated within the bladder.
     
     No lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are present.

     Please assess blood clot seen on prior study.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Reference is made to the patient's most recent prior CT scan,
     from [**3119-8-22**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis from the lung bases through
     the pubic symphysis were acquired helically, with 150 cc of Optiray contrast.
     There were no adverse reactions to contrast administration.  Coronal
     reformatations were performed.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Bilateral pleural effusions are present
     with associated lung volume loss.  The overall size of the pleural effusions
     is increased.  There is an interval increase in the amount of intrahepatic
     biliary ductal dilatation, especially on the left.  There is disruption of the
     anterior abdominal wall with likely granulation tissue formation from prior
     surgical procedures.  The blood clot seen on prior studies has rather markedly
     enlarged.  The hematoma itself is seen best on coronal reconstructions.  The
     hematoma occupies most of the right mid-abdomen and extends superiorly to the
     subhepatic space.  In largest dimensions, the hematoma is 14 x 14 cm.  There
     are additional fluid pockets to the left of mid-line beneath granulation
     tissue which demonstrate an enhancing rind. Abundant soft tissue stranding is
     present adjacent to these fluid collections as well as adjacent to the
     hematoma. The remaining viable loops of small bowel are displaced inferiorly
     and laterally to the left, stretching the mesentery. An area of loculated
     contrast is present within the hematoma posteriorly, located anterior to the
     right kidney.  The hematoma causes mass effect on the right kidney.  The
     kidneys enhance symmetrically.  Multiple surgical drains are present within
     the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Displaced small bowel loops are present
     within the pelvis.  There is free fluid present within the pelvis with high
     attenuation.  A Foley catheter is demonstrated within the bladder.
     
     No lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are present.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 47 year old male status post Whipple resection one month ago,
     including insertion of an isolated segment of gastroduodenal artery to bypass
     a damaged portion of the replaced right hepatic artery. The patient presents
     now with hematocrit drop, hypovolemic shock, and active bleeding along
     peripancreatic [**Location (un) 1654**]-[**Location (un) 1655**] drains.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 132**] [**Name (STitle) 107**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **]'Othee and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 127**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 106**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 107**]
     [**Name (STitle) 108**], staff radiologist, was present throughout the procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS: 200 ml of intraarterial non ionic contrast. Ventilated
     patient, with monitoring during procedure by ICU team.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: The procedure was described to the patient's family
     who consented. The left groin was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion, as
     a right femoral arterial catheter is already in use. A 5 French sheath was
     then advanced over a wire and connected to continuous irrigation with
     heparinized saline. A 5 French cobra C2 glide catheter was used to selectively
     cannulate the proximal portion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). An SMA
     arteriogram was then performed and documented active extravasation from the
     right replaced right hepatic artery (RRHA), aproximately 2-3 cm distally to
     its take-off from the SMA. The mid and distal portions of the SNA and its
     major branches appear vasoconstricted.
     
     Multiple attempts were then made to selectively cannulate the RRHA. This was
     difficult as the angle from the superior mesenteric artery-replaced right
     hepatic artery was unfavorable. A SOS Omnicatheter was eventually used, and a
     3 French Tracker system was advanced through the SOS and into the mid portion
     of the replaced right hepatic artery. Two 3 x 5 mm coils were then advanced
     with the aid of a coil pusher. Both of these coils formed almost immediately
     following deployment, suggesting extra-arterial location. Another 3 x3 mm coil
     was deployed in the mid portion of the RRHA but was soon pushed downstream
     (laterally) by the blood flow. Two 3 x 3 mm coils were then placed in the
     proximal and mid portions of the replaced right hepatic artery, with partial
                                                                 (Over)

     coiling of both (distally for the first one, proximally for the second one).
     
     A repeat SMA arteriogram was performed following placement and documented no
     evidence of further extravasation. Note is made that the 3 x 3 mm coils could
     not be advanced and packed into the middle portion of the RRHA during
     deployment, and the proximal portions of these coils are just at the level of
     the takeoff of the replaced RHA.
     
     The SOS Omnicatheter was then exchanged for a C2 guide catheter, and a
     selective celiac arteriogram was performed. This again demonstrated general
     vasoconstriction of the celiac vessels. The stump of the ligated
     gastroduodenal artery is visualized. The left hepatic artery appears to arise
     from the left gastric artery. There is no evidence for extravasation at or
     around the place of deployment of the titanium coils.
     
     The 5 French left groin sheath was subsequently removed, and compression was
     applied until hemostasis achieved.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: None.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful coil embolization of a replaced right hepatic artery
     arising off the superior mesenteric artery with no further evidence for active
     extravasation at this time.

     a damaged portion of the replaced right hepatic artery. The patient presents
     now with hematocrit drop, hypovolemic shock, and active bleeding along
     peripancreatic [**Location (un) 1654**]-[**Location (un) 1655**] drains.

     [**Name (STitle) 108**], staff radiologist, was present throughout the procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS: 200 ml of intraarterial non ionic contrast. Ventilated
     patient, with monitoring during procedure by ICU team.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: The procedure was described to the patient's family
     who consented. The left groin was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion, as
     a right femoral arterial catheter is already in use. A 5 French sheath was
     then advanced over a wire and connected to continuous irrigation with
     heparinized saline. A 5 French cobra C2 glide catheter was used to selectively
     cannulate the proximal portion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). An SMA
     arteriogram was then performed and documented active extravasation from the
     right replaced right hepatic artery (RRHA), aproximately 2-3 cm distally to
     its take-off from the SMA. The mid and distal portions of the SNA and its
     major branches appear vasoconstricted.
     
     Multiple attempts were then made to selectively cannulate the RRHA. This was
     difficult as the angle from the superior mesenteric artery-replaced right
     hepatic artery was unfavorable. A SOS Omnicatheter was eventually used, and a
     3 French Tracker system was advanced through the SOS and into the mid portion
     of the replaced right hepatic artery. Two 3 x 5 mm coils were then advanced
     with the aid of a coil pusher. Both of these coils formed almost immediately
     following deployment, suggesting extra-arterial location. Another 3 x3 mm coil
     was deployed in the mid portion of the RRHA but was soon pushed downstream
     (laterally) by the blood flow. Two 3 x 3 mm coils were then placed in the
     proximal and mid portions of the replaced right hepatic artery, with partial
                                                                 (Over)

     not be advanced and packed into the middle portion of the RRHA during
     deployment, and the proximal portions of these coils are just at the level of
     the takeoff of the replaced RHA.
     
     The SOS Omnicatheter was then exchanged for a C2 guide catheter, and a
     selective celiac arteriogram was performed. This again demonstrated general
     vasoconstriction of the celiac vessels. The stump of the ligated
     gastroduodenal artery is visualized. The left hepatic artery appears to arise
     from the left gastric artery. There is no evidence for extravasation at or
     around the place of deployment of the titanium coils.
     
     The 5 French left groin sheath was subsequently removed, and compression was
     applied until hemostasis achieved.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

      s/p whipple procedure
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 47 year old male status post Whipple resection one month ago,
     including insertion of an isolated segment of gastroduodenal artery to bypass
     a damaged portion of the replaced right hepatic artery. The patient presents
     now with hematocrit drop, hypovolemic shock, and active bleeding along
     peripancreatic [**Location (un) 1654**]-[**Location (un) 1655**] drains.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 132**] [**Name (STitle) 107**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **]'Othee and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 127**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 106**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 107**]
     [**Name (STitle) 108**], staff radiologist, was present throughout the procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS: 200 ml of intraarterial non ionic contrast. Ventilated
     patient, with monitoring during procedure by ICU team.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: The procedure was described to the patient's family
     who consented. The left groin was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion, as
     a right femoral arterial catheter is already in use. A 5 French sheath was
     then advanced over a wire and connected to continuous irrigation with
     heparinized saline. A 5 French cobra C2 glide catheter was used to selectively
     cannulate the proximal portion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). An SMA
     arteriogram was then performed and documented active extravasation from the
     right replaced right hepatic artery (RRHA), aproximately 2-3 cm distally to
     its take-off from the SMA. The mid and distal portions of the SNA and its
     major branches appear vasoconstricted.
     
     Multiple attempts were then made to selectively cannulate the RRHA. This was
     difficult as the angle from the superior mesenteric artery-replaced right
     hepatic artery was unfavorable. A SOS Omnicatheter was eventually used, and a
     3 French Tracker system was advanced through the SOS and into the mid portion
     of the replaced right hepatic artery. Two 3 x 5 mm coils were then advanced
     with the aid of a coil pusher. Both of these coils formed almost immediately
     following deployment, suggesting extra-arterial location. Another 3 x3 mm coil
     was deployed in the mid portion of the RRHA but was soon pushed downstream
     (laterally) by the blood flow. Two 3 x 3 mm coils were then placed in the
     proximal and mid portions of the replaced right hepatic artery, with partial
                                                                 (Over)

     A repeat SMA arteriogram was performed following placement and documented no
     evidence of further extravasation. Note is made that the 3 x 3 mm coils could
     not be advanced and packed into the middle portion of the RRHA during
     deployment, and the proximal portions of these coils are just at the level of
     the takeoff of the replaced RHA.
     
     The SOS Omnicatheter was then exchanged for a C2 guide catheter, and a
     selective celiac arteriogram was performed. This again demonstrated general
     vasoconstriction of the celiac vessels. The stump of the ligated
     gastroduodenal artery is visualized. The left hepatic artery appears to arise
     from the left gastric artery. There is no evidence for extravasation at or
     around the place of deployment of the titanium coils.
     
     The 5 French left groin sheath was subsequently removed, and compression was
     applied until hemostasis achieved.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: None.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful coil embolization of a replaced right hepatic artery
     arising off the superior mesenteric artery with no further evidence for active
     extravasation at this time.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      evaluate for GI bleeding has had acute hct drop requiring multiple PRBC and FFP 
      s/p whipple procedure
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 47 year old male status post Whipple resection one month ago,
     including insertion of an isolated segment of gastroduodenal artery to bypass
     a damaged portion of the replaced right hepatic artery. The patient presents
     now with hematocrit drop, hypovolemic shock, and active bleeding along
     peripancreatic [**Location (un) 1654**]-[**Location (un) 1655**] drains.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 132**] [**Name (STitle) 107**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **]'Othee and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 127**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 106**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 107**]
     [**Name (STitle) 108**], staff radiologist, was present throughout the procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS: 200 ml of intraarterial non ionic contrast. Ventilated
     patient, with monitoring during procedure by ICU team.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: The procedure was described to the patient's family
     who consented. The left groin was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion, as
     a right femoral arterial catheter is already in use. A 5 French sheath was
     then advanced over a wire and connected to continuous irrigation with
     heparinized saline. A 5 French cobra C2 glide catheter was used to selectively
     cannulate the proximal portion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). An SMA
     arteriogram was then performed and documented active extravasation from the
     right replaced right hepatic artery (RRHA), aproximately 2-3 cm distally to
     its take-off from the SMA. The mid and distal portions of the SNA and its
     major branches appear vasoconstricted.
     
     Multiple attempts were then made to selectively cannulate the RRHA. This was
     difficult as the angle from the superior mesenteric artery-replaced right
     hepatic artery was unfavorable. A SOS Omnicatheter was eventually used, and a
     3 French Tracker system was advanced through the SOS and into the mid portion
     of the replaced right hepatic artery. Two 3 x 5 mm coils were then advanced
     with the aid of a coil pusher. Both of these coils formed almost immediately
     following deployment, suggesting extra-arterial location. Another 3 x3 mm coil
     was deployed in the mid portion of the RRHA but was soon pushed downstream
     (laterally) by the blood flow. Two 3 x 3 mm coils were then placed in the
     proximal and mid portions of the replaced right hepatic artery, with partial
                                                                 (Over)

     coiling of both (distally for the first one, proximally for the second one).
     
     A repeat SMA arteriogram was performed following placement and documented no
     evidence of further extravasation. Note is made that the 3 x 3 mm coils could
     not be advanced and packed into the middle portion of the RRHA during
     deployment, and the proximal portions of these coils are just at the level of
     the takeoff of the replaced RHA.
     
     The SOS Omnicatheter was then exchanged for a C2 guide catheter, and a
     selective celiac arteriogram was performed. This again demonstrated general
     vasoconstriction of the celiac vessels. The stump of the ligated
     gastroduodenal artery is visualized. The left hepatic artery appears to arise
     from the left gastric artery. There is no evidence for extravasation at or
     around the place of deployment of the titanium coils.
     
     The 5 French left groin sheath was subsequently removed, and compression was
     applied until hemostasis achieved.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: None.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful coil embolization of a replaced right hepatic artery
     arising off the superior mesenteric artery with no further evidence for active
     extravasation at this time.

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Line placement.
     
     Comparison is made to previous study of earlier the same date.
     
     A left subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the SVC, but the
     distal tip is in close proximity to the lateral wall of the structure. A SG
     catheter is in satisfactory position.  The NG tube coils in the stomach with
     the distal tip directed cephalad, pointing toward the GE junction.  An ET tube
     is in satisfactory position.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in
     the interval.  There remains a moderate-sized left pleural effusion tracking
     to the left apex.  Adjacent increased opacity in the left retrocardiac region
     is noted.  The imaged portion of the right lung is clear, but portions of the
     right lung laterally have been excluded from the film.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Left subclavian central venous catheter in satisfactory position with the
     exception of its close proximity to the lateral wall of the SVC.
     Repositioning may be helpful for more optimal placement.
     
     2. Moderate sized layering left pleural effusion.  Adjacent increased opacity
     in left retrocardiac region may reflect atelectasis or pneumonia.

     INDICATIONS:    GI bleed.  The patient is s/p two coil embolizations of a
     replaced right hepatic artery and again presents with hemodynamic instability.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 215**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 133**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 133**], the staff radiologist, was
     present throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  A 5 French sheath was present in the left groin from the
     prior embolization procedure. The area was prepped and draped in a standard
     sterile fashion.  An Omniflush catheter was advanced over a wire into the
     aorta.  An aortogram was performed using digital subtraction angiography.
     There was a slight blush of the left kidney which raised a question of
     bleeding versus subtraction artifact.  A 5 French C2 catheter was advanced
     into the left renal artery and a renal arteriogram was performed.  A normal
     branching pattern of vessels was appreciated with no evidence for extravastion
     of contrast material.
     
     The catheter was then advanced into the SMA.  A run in this location
     demonstrated faint flow through the replaced right hepatic artery. A wire was
     advanced and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 15635**] Loop was performed to gain access to the origin of the
     right hepatic artery.  It was difficult to gain access to the replaced right
     hepatic artery as the coils extended to the origin of the vessel and it was
     difficult to obtain purchase. A 5 French [**Doctor Last Name 3272**] II catheter was reformed in
     the left subclavian artery and attempts were made to engage the replaced right
     hepatic artery with a glidewire, stiff glidewire and tracker system.
     
     We were not able to advance the tip of the catheter past the origin of the
     replaced right hepatic artery. A run in this location demonstrated frank
     extravasation of contrast material just distal to the medial aspect of the
     coils.  There was no evidence for an intact vessel distal to this point.
     
     We discused these findings with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5170**] at the time of the procedure. It was
     decided to stop the procedure at this point and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5170**] would speak with the
     patient's family.
     
     IMPRESSION:   Partial recannalization of the previously occluded replaced
     right hepatic artery. We were not able to gain satisfactory purchase into the
     replaced right hepatic artery as the coils were packed up to near the origin.
     A recannulization of this artery may have been secondary to the patient's
     coagulopathy and lack of an intact vessel distally.

     INDICATIONS:    GI bleed.  The patient is s/p two coil embolizations of a
     replaced right hepatic artery and again presents with hemodynamic instability.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 215**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 133**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 133**], the staff radiologist, was
     present throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  A 5 French sheath was present in the left groin from the
     prior embolization procedure. The area was prepped and draped in a standard
     sterile fashion.  An Omniflush catheter was advanced over a wire into the
     aorta.  An aortogram was performed using digital subtraction angiography.
     There was a slight blush of the left kidney which raised a question of
     bleeding versus subtraction artifact.  A 5 French C2 catheter was advanced
     into the left renal artery and a renal arteriogram was performed.  A normal
     branching pattern of vessels was appreciated with no evidence for extravastion
     of contrast material.
     
     The catheter was then advanced into the SMA.  A run in this location
     demonstrated faint flow through the replaced right hepatic artery. A wire was
     advanced and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 15635**] Loop was performed to gain access to the origin of the
     right hepatic artery.  It was difficult to gain access to the replaced right
     hepatic artery as the coils extended to the origin of the vessel and it was
     difficult to obtain purchase. A 5 French [**Doctor Last Name 3272**] II catheter was reformed in
     the left subclavian artery and attempts were made to engage the replaced right
     hepatic artery with a glidewire, stiff glidewire and tracker system.
     
     We were not able to advance the tip of the catheter past the origin of the
     replaced right hepatic artery. A run in this location demonstrated frank
     extravasation of contrast material just distal to the medial aspect of the
     coils.  There was no evidence for an intact vessel distal to this point.
     
     We discused these findings with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5170**] at the time of the procedure. It was
     decided to stop the procedure at this point and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5170**] would speak with the
     patient's family.
     
     IMPRESSION:   Partial recannalization of the previously occluded replaced
     right hepatic artery. We were not able to gain satisfactory purchase into the
     replaced right hepatic artery as the coils were packed up to near the origin.
     A recannulization of this artery may have been secondary to the patient's
     coagulopathy and lack of an intact vessel distally.

     INDICATION:  Patient is status post coil embolization of replaced right
     hepatic artery extravasation earlier today. The patient presents again with
     hemodynamic instability.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 132**] [**Name (STitle) 107**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **]'[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 127**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 106**], and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 127**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 215**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 107**] [**Name (STitle) **], staff radiologist, was present throughout the
     procedure.
     
     CONTRAST:  80 ml of Optiray 320 at 60%.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The left groin was again prepped and draped in
     a sterile fashion, and a 5 FR sheath was placed was accessed.  A 5 FR
     Omniflush catheter was placed in the distal thoracic aorta, and an AP
     aortogram was initially obtained to look for a possible source of bleeding
     other than from the replaced right hepatic artery.  No source was identified.
     Selective cannulation of the superior mesenteric artery was then performed
     with a C2 guide catheter, which documented further extravasation from the
     previously coiled right hepatic artery arising from the proximal superior
     mesenteric artery.  The remainder of the superior mesenteric artery is
     significantly vasoconstricted.
     
     Cannulation of the replaced right hepatic artery was then attempted, using
     various catheter--guidewire combinations.  Eventually, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3272**] 2 catheter
     was placed at the origin of the replaced right hepatic artery, and a 3 FR
     Tracker catheter was manipulated beyond the previously placed coils and into
     the mid portion of the vessel.  One 3 mm x 3 cm coil was then deployed under
     magnification fluoroscopic guidance.  No further coils could be placed due to
     the size of the vessel, was appeared vasoconstricted.  An arteriogram was
     performed following this coil embolization and documented no evidence for
     further extravasation.
     
     The [**Doctor Last Name 3272**] 2 catheter was then removed over a guidewire.  The left groin
     sheath was not removed, but rather placed to heparinized saline for patency.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Repeat superior mesenteric arteriogram again demonstrating active
     extravasation from the previously coiled replaced right hepatic artery. 3 mm x
     3 cm coil deployed, without evidence for further extravasation at this time.
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Patient is status post coil embolization of replaced right
     hepatic artery extravasation earlier today. The patient presents again with
     hemodynamic instability.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 132**] [**Name (STitle) 107**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **]'[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 127**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 106**], and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 127**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 215**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 107**] [**Name (STitle) **], staff radiologist, was present throughout the
     procedure.
     
     CONTRAST:  80 ml of Optiray 320 at 60%.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The left groin was again prepped and draped in
     a sterile fashion, and a 5 FR sheath was placed was accessed.  A 5 FR
     Omniflush catheter was placed in the distal thoracic aorta, and an AP
     aortogram was initially obtained to look for a possible source of bleeding
     other than from the replaced right hepatic artery.  No source was identified.
     Selective cannulation of the superior mesenteric artery was then performed
     with a C2 guide catheter, which documented further extravasation from the
     previously coiled right hepatic artery arising from the proximal superior
     mesenteric artery.  The remainder of the superior mesenteric artery is
     significantly vasoconstricted.
     
     Cannulation of the replaced right hepatic artery was then attempted, using
     various catheter--guidewire combinations.  Eventually, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3272**] 2 catheter
     was placed at the origin of the replaced right hepatic artery, and a 3 FR
     Tracker catheter was manipulated beyond the previously placed coils and into
     the mid portion of the vessel.  One 3 mm x 3 cm coil was then deployed under
     magnification fluoroscopic guidance.  No further coils could be placed due to
     the size of the vessel, was appeared vasoconstricted.  An arteriogram was
     performed following this coil embolization and documented no evidence for
     further extravasation.
     
     The [**Doctor Last Name 3272**] 2 catheter was then removed over a guidewire.  The left groin
     sheath was not removed, but rather placed to heparinized saline for patency.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Repeat superior mesenteric arteriogram again demonstrating active
     extravasation from the previously coiled replaced right hepatic artery. 3 mm x
     3 cm coil deployed, without evidence for further extravasation at this time.
                                                                 (Over)
