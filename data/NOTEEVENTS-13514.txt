History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 78 year old right handed female with past medical 
history of hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, post herpetic 
neuralgia, right foot drop who presented to [**Hospital1 19**] ED on [**2813-3-29**] 
as a transfer from [**Hospital3 **] with right frontal 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

Patient was confused and unable to give own history; history 
provided by family. Per patient's daughter and son, patient was 
talking on phone to out of state daughter earlier today around 
10am. Apparently, she sounded confused and not quite herself. 
Then later on around 1pm, she was talking to second daughter via 
telephone. She noted patient to be confused and repeating words. 
Her speech was mumbled at times but not slurred. Daughter went 
to her house and transported her to [**Hospital3 **] ED, concerned she 
was confused or anxious. Daugther did not note any face droop, 
weakness, incoordination. Prior to taking her to ED, patient got 
dose of own home Lorazepam. 

On arrival to [**Hospital3 **], vitals T 99.2, P 82, BP 147/74, RR 17. 
 Per [**Hospital3 **] notes, she apparently was no longer confused. 
Head CT showed right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. 
Dilantin 1 gram was started and patient was transferred here.  

On arrival here, BP 170/90, HR 80, RR 16. BP 143-175 systolic. 
Complained of irritation and burning at Dilantin infusion site 
so infusion stopped. Received Phosphenytoin 1 gram and Labetalol 
10 mg IV. Unable to get MRI images due to agitation, confusion, 
even after 2 mg Ativan. Intubated in ED for altered mental 
status, airway protection. Post intubation, BP still elevated so 
urged ED staff to start Labetalol or Nipride gtt to get BP under 
control.

-----
MRI/A brain [**2814-3-31**]: There is a well circumscribed round 
heterogeneous lesion in the interhemispheric fissure, just to 
the right of midline, measuring approximately 1.5 cm in diameter 
with magnetic susceptibility. Possibilities to consider are: 
pericallosal branch aneurysm, which is partially thrombosed vs. 
atypical cavernous angioma. This lesion does not have a typical 
appearance for a meningioma. Acute areas of brain ischemia 
involving the left frontal lobe and left corona radiata.  MR 
angiography of the Circle of [**Location (un) 449**] and its tributaries.
-----
CT head [**2814-3-31**]:  13 mm rounded hyperdensity at the parafalcine 
right frontal lobe. In comparison to the outside CT performed at 
16:51, [**2814-3-30**] at [**Hospital6 9205**], this visually has not 
significantly changed in appearance, althoug calibration markers 
for size were not printed on the images provided (these images 
are not available during attending review). Appearances are most 
suggestive of hemorrhage into mass lesion. Alternatively, it 
could be calcification in a lesion such as a meningioma. 
Follow-up recommended.
-----
CT torso [**2814-3-31**]:  
1) No evidence of abdominal or pelvic malignancy.
2) Endotracheal tube with its tip just proximal to the carina, 
this could be retracted several centimeters.
3) Diffuse septal thickening with honeycombing predominantly 
affecting the peripheral/subpleural and basal regions, likely 
consistent with UIP/IPF.
-----
TTE:  
1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic 
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall 
motion is normal.  
2. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.  
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial 
mitral  
regurgitation is seen.  
4. No cardiac source of embolus seen.  
-----
CT/CTA head [**2814-4-9**]: Again noted is a well-circumscribed, round 
hyperdensity in the right parafalcine location measuring about 
1.4 cm representing an aneurysm. This is unchanged in appearance 
compared to the prior study. Again noted is bilateral 
hypodensities in the subcortical white matter of the frontal 
lobes, stable in appearance. There is no evidence of acute 
hemorrhage or mass effect. The [**Doctor Last Name 898**]-white differentiation is 
preserved. Again noted is a partially thrombosed aneurysm in the 
A2 segment of the left anterior cerebral artery. The distal A2 
segment arises from the aneurysm. Compared to the angiographic 
study, the size appears to be stable. No other aneurysms are 
defined.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 78 year old female with past medical history of 
hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, GERD who presented to [**Hospital1 19**] 
on [**2814-3-31**] after a confusional spell. Found to have a right 
frontal abnormality on head CT. Originally, this abnormality 
appeared to be consistent with intracerebral hemorrhage, thus 
she was admitted to the ICU for blood pressure control and neuro 
monitoring. She was also intubated in the ED for agitation. MRI 
later on hospital day #1 was consistent with a thrombosed 
aneurysm of the left ACA with concomitant left ACA stroke and 
scattered smaller strokes.   

She underwent angiogram on [**2814-4-2**] which confirmed the presence 
of thrombosed aneurysm on LEFT ACA A2 division; no intervention 
was done due to the stable, thrombosed nature of aneursym. 
Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2814-4-3**] to determine the 
presence or absence of xanthocrhomia.  CSF was negative for 
xanthochromia, thus it is unlikely that she bled from this 
aneurysm. Plan was for patient to undergo repeat vascular 
imaging (either CTA or repeat angio) to determine if the 
aneurysm has grown. In the mean time, she was started on low 
dose heparin gtt with goal PTT 40-60 per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 321**] for her 
strokes given that they likely originated from the thrombosed 
aneurysm. Repeat CTA on [**2814-4-9**] demonstrated stable appearance 
of the aneursym. As such, she was started on aspirin. She will 
need to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 321**] approximately 4 weeks after 
discharge for repeat imaging and/or repeat angiogram. 
Additionally, she will need to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] 
in Stroke Clinic at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9206**] one month after discharge from 
rehab.

Prior to learning that the frontal lobe abnormality was an 
aneurysm, she underwent a CT torso looking for malignancy out of 
concern the left frontal lesion was a malignancy. CT torso was 
negative for signs of malignancy, and breast exam was normal. 
She also underwent transthoracic echo and blood cx x 3 to rule 
out endocarditis.  Workup was negative.  

For BP control and prevention of vasospasm, she was started on 
nimodipine. She was started on a statin for her stroke for 
secondary prevention. Blood pressure was ultimately well 
controlled with a beta blocker and amlodipine.  

She was loaded with dilantin (once at OSH and once in our ED, 
although it's unclear how much of the original load she 
recieved) given that this lesion in her brain is in a hightly 
epielptogenic location, the cingulate cortex.  Her original 
complaint of confusion may have been due to seizures. Per 
neurology, she is to continue on Dilantin indefinitely, at least 
until time of follow up in Stroke Clinic. Goal corrected level 
is between [**12-4**]; of note, patient's albumin level has been 
between 2.5-2.9. EEG [**2814-4-3**] was consistent with encephalopathy 
but had no evidence of ongoing seizure activity.

In term of her respiratory issues, she has a history of 
interstitial lung disease at baseline secondary to rheumatoid 
arthritis. She was intubated for airway protection on admission 
and remained intubated for MRI, angio, LP, etc. She was 
extubated on [**2814-4-3**].  Unfortunately, she developed laryngeal 
edema (vocal cords, etc) with stridor and had to be re-intubated 
on [**2814-4-3**].  She was placed on dexamethasone for edema and 
extubation was retried. Ultimately, she failed extubation again 
and underwent tracheostomy placement [**2814-4-10**]. She is in process 
of weaning from ventilator support, but we expect this will be 
limited until her upper airway edema resolves. CT torso [**2814-4-14**] 
showed stable interstitial lung disease but no evidence of acute 
cardiopulmonary process.

In terms of infectitious disease issues, she was first febrile 
on [**2814-4-3**]. Initial infectious work up was negative. She then 
respikes [**2814-4-6**] and had persistent daily fevers up until 
[**2814-4-14**]. Work up revealed Vancomycin sensitive Enterococcal 
urinary tract infection and Levoquin sensitive Klebsiella 
urinary tract infection. Blood cultures demonstrated coagulase 
negative Staph aureus on two different dates. Given her 
immunosuppressed status, ID recommended resiting her intravenous 
and PICC lines and treating the coagulase negative Staph aureus. 
On discharge, she still needs 5 additional days of Levaquin and 
10 days of Vancomycin. PICC line was resited [**2814-4-15**].
 
For her rheumatoid arthritis she continued oxycodone for pain 
control and her outpatient meds of Arava and Prednisone.
 
For post stroke glycemic control, she was on an insulin sliding 
scale. We expect this can be discontinued while at rehab should 
her blood sugars stay well controlled.

She currently has a Dobhoff tube in for feeds. She was unable to 
cooperate with a formal swallow evaluation due to altered mental 
status in setting of her urinary infections. She should have a 
repeat swallow evaluation while at rehab so that tube feeds can 
be discontinued. If she fails repeat swallow evaluation, she 
will need evaluation of PEG placement.

In terms of hematologic issues, she was found to be anemic with 
hct dropping as low as 24 during this admission. At one point, 
she was transfused 2 units packed red blood cells. Work up 
revealed an anemia of chronic disease, likely related to her 
rheumatoid arthritis. At time of discharge, hematocrit was 
stable. 

At time of discharge, she was awake, alert. She was able to 
communicate by writing, shaking head yes/no, and by mouthing out 
answers. However, at times her answers were inconsistent and 
inappropriate. She might benefit from a formal language 
evaluation to assess for receptive aphasia. She had no acute 
cranial nerve abnormalities. She was able to move all 
extremities spontaneously, with minimal right lower extremity 
weakness and old right foot drop. She will need continued 
physical and occupational therapy in order to maximize her 
functional status.

     INDICATION:  78 year old female with hemorrhage and possible underlying mass
     found in the brain, assess for malignancy.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with oral and
     150cc nonionic IV Optiray contrast.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  Endotracheal tube is noted, with its tip
     just proximal to the carina.  This could be retracted several cm.  Nasogastric
     tube seen with its tip in the antrum of the stomach.  The airways are patent
     ot the segmental level.  The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are
     unremarkable. There is no pericardial effusion.  There is diffuse septal
     thickening and ground glass opacity with predominance towards the subpleural
     regions and the bases, with honeycombing inferiorly consistent with UIP/IPF.
     This is affecting the right lobe of the lung more than the left. There are no
     nodules or masses seen within the lungs, and there is no evidence of
     consolidation or pleural effusions.  No pathologically enlarged nodes within
     the axillae or in the mediastinum.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver is unremarkable with no focal
     lesions.  The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are normal.
     The kidneys are normal without focal lesions and excrete contrast normally.
     The mesentery and retroperitoneum demonstrate no abnormal nodes.  There is no
     free fluid or free air within the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The intrapelvic bowel is unremarkable.
     There is no free fluid within the pelvis.  There is no abnormal adenopathy
     within the inguinal or deep pelvic regions.  The bladder, uterus, and adnexa
     appear unremarkable.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Bilateral femoral prostheses, with evidence of old fracture. No
     suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are seen within the osseous structures.
      There is mild diffuse degenerative disease of the thoracolumbar spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) No evidence of abdominal or pelvic malignancy.
     2) Endotracheal tube with its tip just proximal to the carina, this could be
     retracted several centimeters.

      do post gadolinium images to rule out mass lesion with hemorrhage into infarct.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     INDICATION:  78-year-old woman with hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, with
     right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 & T2W images were obtained throughout the brain.
     Gadolinium was given without complications.
     
     FINDINGS:  No previous exam is available for comparison.  The study is being
     read in conjunction with a head CT from [**2814-3-31**].
     
     This is a preliminary reading on this exam, since additional images will be
     acquired.
     
     A well-circumscribed round lesion is seen in the interhemispheric fissure,
     between the frontal lobes,  just to the right of midline, which measures
     approximately 1.5 cm in diameter. This lesion has heterogeneous signal on T1W
     and T2W images. There is susceptibility blooming artifact seen on gradient-
     echo sequence, and there is thin peripheral enhancement after administration
     of gadolinium, as well as central enhancement.  This is a nonspecific finding,
     but the possibility of a partially thrombosed aneurysm arising from a
     pericallosal branch should be considered. An atypical cavernous angioma in the
     right frontal lobe is also a possibility. There is no significant mass effect
     associated with this mass, but there is moderate surrounding edema in the
     right frontal lobe.
     
     Patchy areas of increased T2 signal are seen in the periventricular and deep
     white matter consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic changes, in both
     cererbral hemispheres.  Midline structures are normal in position.  Ventricles
     and subarachnoid spaces are within normal limits.
     
     Chronic lacunar infarct vs. small Virchow-[**Doctor First Name 627**] space is seen in the left
     pons. Cerebellum is within normal limits.
     
     ADDNENDUM:  There are 2 small areas of restricted diffusion involving the high
     convexity of the left frontal lobe,  consistent with regions of acute brain
     ischemia within the territories of the left anterior and middle cerebral
     arteries. A

     IMPRESSION:  There is a well circumscribed round heterogeneous lesion in the

     vs. atypical cavernous angioma.  This lesion does not have a typical
     appearance for a meningioma.
     
     ADDENDUM: Acute areas of brain ischemia involving the left frontal lobe and
     left corona radiata.  Report of this exam was given to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 628**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 629**], physician in

     FINDINGS: The suspected partially thrombosed aneurysm is likely confirmed, as
     there is probable flow within a 2mm portion along the medial aspect of the
     lesion.  No other overt vascular pathology is seen.

Brief ROS: 
Neuro-  Pt. remains on propofol gtt. When off gtt she is easily arousable, opens eyes when spoken to. Sticks tongue out on command(clearly). She has very weak grips and does not move feet on command. She will, however, notch knees up in bed, spontaneously- albeit very slowly and weakly. Once awake she continues to move in bed, lifting head off of bed- pulling at wrist restraints, somewhat agitated. Had an increase in propofol but SBP sagged and prop presently turned off. PREL.

      Coiling of aneurysm.  Current in-patient.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Anterior cerebral artery aneurysm. 
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Wide-necked 6 x 4 mm mostly thrombosed aneurysm of
     the left A-2 segment of the anterior cerebral artery.
     
     INDICATION: Ms. [**Known patient lastname 633**] is a 78-year-old female who was transferred from an
     outside hospital to the Neurology service with a question of a frontal
     intraparenchymal hemorrhage. MRI and MRA examination revealed this to
     be most likely a partially thrombosed pericallosal artery wide-necked
     aneurysm. In addition, she is seen to have DWI changes in the left
     frontal lobe with the aneurysm pointing towards the right.  She is undergoing
     this angiogram to elucidate the anatomy of this aneurysm and etiology of the
     stroke she has sustained in the left frontal lobe.
     
     CONSENT: The patient's son was given a full and complete explanation of the
     procedure. Specifically, the indications, risks, benefits, and alternatives to
     the procedure were explained in detail. In addition, the possible
     complications, such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke, neurological
     deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen complications,
     including the risk of coma and even death, were outlined. The patient's son
     understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought into the Endovascular Suite and
     placed on the table in supine position. The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion. A 19-gauge single-wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right common femoral artery, and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood, a 4 Fr vascular sheath was inserted over a guide wire and kept
     on a heparinized saline drip. Next, a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels: the right common carotid
     artery, right internal carotid artery, left common carotid artery, left
                                                                 (Over)

     RESULTS: Injection of the right common carotid artery demonstrates a smooth
     cervical segment without evidence of stenosis or dissection and a smooth-
     appearing right carotid bifurcation. Injection of the right internal carotid
     artery demonstrates a small amount of fibromuscular dysplasia at the high
     cervical segment. Otherwise there are no intracranial aneurysms, stenosis,
     dissection or branch occlusion identified. No filling is seen across the
     anterior communicating artery on injection of the right internal carotid
     artery. Injection of the left common carotid artery shows a smooth cervical
     segment without evidence of stenosis or dissection. A smooth-appearing left
     internal carotid origin and carotid bifurcation. Injection of the left common
     carotid artery intracranial imaging was performed. This demonstrates the
     presence of large posterior communicating artery as well as filling of the
     left ACA and MCA branches. Within the left AP segment, at the branch point of
     the pericallosal and callosal marginal arteries, a 4 x 6 mm wide-necked
     aneurysm is identified. This is not amenable to endovascular intervention.
     Biplane rotational angiographic imaging confirms this. Otherwise, no other
     intracranial aneurysms are identified. Injection of the left subclavian artery
     shows no evidence of stenosis or dissection and a tortuous-appearing origin of
     the left vertebral artery. Cervically, there is a small amount of
     fibromuscular dysplasia at the level of C1-2 within the left vertebral artery,
     and intracranially the left vertebral artery contributes flow to the basilar
     artery and its branches. There is a somewhat bulbuous-appearing apex of the
     basilar artery. Otherwise, no evidence of intracranial aneurysm, stenosis or
     dissection present.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      78 year old woman with tumor vs. aneurysm.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Coiling of aneurysm.  Current in-patient.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Anterior cerebral artery aneurysm. 
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Wide-necked 6 x 4 mm mostly thrombosed aneurysm of
     the left A-2 segment of the anterior cerebral artery.
     
     INDICATION: Ms. [**Known patient lastname 633**] is a 78-year-old female who was transferred from an
     outside hospital to the Neurology service with a question of a frontal
     intraparenchymal hemorrhage. MRI and MRA examination revealed this to
     be most likely a partially thrombosed pericallosal artery wide-necked
     aneurysm. In addition, she is seen to have DWI changes in the left
     frontal lobe with the aneurysm pointing towards the right.  She is undergoing
     this angiogram to elucidate the anatomy of this aneurysm and etiology of the
     stroke she has sustained in the left frontal lobe.
     
     CONSENT: The patient's son was given a full and complete explanation of the
     procedure. Specifically, the indications, risks, benefits, and alternatives to
     the procedure were explained in detail. In addition, the possible
     complications, such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke, neurological
     deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen complications,
     including the risk of coma and even death, were outlined. The patient's son
     understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought into the Endovascular Suite and
     placed on the table in supine position. The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion. A 19-gauge single-wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right common femoral artery, and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood, a 4 Fr vascular sheath was inserted over a guide wire and kept
     on a heparinized saline drip. Next, a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels: the right common carotid
     artery, right internal carotid artery, left common carotid artery, left
                                                                 (Over)

     RESULTS: Injection of the right common carotid artery demonstrates a smooth
     cervical segment without evidence of stenosis or dissection and a smooth-
     appearing right carotid bifurcation. Injection of the right internal carotid
     artery demonstrates a small amount of fibromuscular dysplasia at the high
     cervical segment. Otherwise there are no intracranial aneurysms, stenosis,
     dissection or branch occlusion identified. No filling is seen across the
     anterior communicating artery on injection of the right internal carotid
     artery. Injection of the left common carotid artery shows a smooth cervical
     segment without evidence of stenosis or dissection. A smooth-appearing left
     internal carotid origin and carotid bifurcation. Injection of the left common
     carotid artery intracranial imaging was performed. This demonstrates the
     presence of large posterior communicating artery as well as filling of the
     left ACA and MCA branches. Within the left AP segment, at the branch point of
     the pericallosal and callosal marginal arteries, a 4 x 6 mm wide-necked
     aneurysm is identified. This is not amenable to endovascular intervention.
     Biplane rotational angiographic imaging confirms this. Otherwise, no other
     intracranial aneurysms are identified. Injection of the left subclavian artery
     shows no evidence of stenosis or dissection and a tortuous-appearing origin of
     the left vertebral artery. Cervically, there is a small amount of
     fibromuscular dysplasia at the level of C1-2 within the left vertebral artery,
     and intracranially the left vertebral artery contributes flow to the basilar
     artery and its branches. There is a somewhat bulbuous-appearing apex of the
     basilar artery. Otherwise, no evidence of intracranial aneurysm, stenosis or
     dissection present.
     
     IMPRESSION: Wide-necked 6 x 4 mm aneurysm of the A-2 segment of the left
     anterior cerebral artery.

     left ACA and MCA branches. Within the left AP segment, at the branch point of
     the pericallosal and callosal marginal arteries, a 4 x 6 mm wide-necked
     aneurysm is identified. This is not amenable to endovascular intervention.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      78 year old woman with tumor vs. aneurysm.

      Coiling of aneurysm.  Current in-patient.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Anterior cerebral artery aneurysm. 
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Wide-necked 6 x 4 mm mostly thrombosed aneurysm of
     the left A-2 segment of the anterior cerebral artery.
     
     INDICATION: Ms. [**Known patient lastname 633**] is a 78-year-old female who was transferred from an
     outside hospital to the Neurology service with a question of a frontal
     intraparenchymal hemorrhage. MRI and MRA examination revealed this to
     be most likely a partially thrombosed pericallosal artery wide-necked
     aneurysm. In addition, she is seen to have DWI changes in the left
     frontal lobe with the aneurysm pointing towards the right.  She is undergoing
     this angiogram to elucidate the anatomy of this aneurysm and etiology of the
     stroke she has sustained in the left frontal lobe.
     
     CONSENT: The patient's son was given a full and complete explanation of the
     procedure. Specifically, the indications, risks, benefits, and alternatives to
     the procedure were explained in detail. In addition, the possible
     complications, such as the risk of bleeding, infection, stroke, neurological
     deficit or deterioration, groin hematoma, and other unforeseen complications,
     including the risk of coma and even death, were outlined. The patient's son
     understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought into the Endovascular Suite and
     placed on the table in supine position. The right groin area was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion. A 19-gauge single-wall needle was then
     used to puncture the right common femoral artery, and upon the return of brisk
     arterial blood, a 4 Fr vascular sheath was inserted over a guide wire and kept
     on a heparinized saline drip. Next, a diagnostic catheter was used to
     selectively catheterize the following vessels: the right common carotid
     artery, right internal carotid artery, left common carotid artery, left

EVENTS:

*****FAILED EXTUBATION--->>>Post extubation started with mild stridor with copious secretions.  Stridor became increasingly worse desipite nebs and racemic epi.  Oxygenation not an issue though. Work of breathing increased with pt becoming more lethargic. Reintubated.  Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1875**], severe vocal cord swelling seen upon reintubation.  Started on steroids after.  ENT also up to evaluate.

*****LP this am--per [**Last Name (STitle) **]--->>no blood in fluid. Started on heparin drip this afternoon for a couple of days. Will then have angio again to evaluate aneurysm.  EEG also done this evening.

REVIEW of SYSTEMS:

Neuro....Post extubation, pt A&O x2, cooperative and following commands. No weakness noted. Not c/o headache.  After reintubation, restarted on propofol drip at low dose. Arouses to voice, follows commands fairly consistently. Moving all extremites. Pupils 3-4mm and reactive.  Strong cough. Restarted on dilantin per [**Last Name (STitle) **] team.  Continues on nimodipine Q4hrs.

CV....NSR with no ectopy noted. HR 70-80's.  Goal SBP <140.  See careview for specifc trends.  BP not an issue except when light---normalizes with sedation.  Extremely hypertensive immediately following intubation.  Given fentanyl, lopressor, and propofol boluses to bring BP down.  

RESP....See above note.  Post reintubation, initially on CMV. Weaned back to PS  5/8/40% by this evening.  Sats >99%. RR teens with good volumes.  While extubated, pt with copious secretions, slightly frothy. CXR showed lungs slightly wet--lasix 20mg given.  

GI...NGT replaced. Confirmed placement via x-ray.  Started TF's---Promote with goal of 50cc/hr.  Abd soft with active BS. +flatus.

GU....Adequate clear yellow urine output. 20mg of lasix after intubation.  Good response seen. Repleted Ca++

ENDO...No coverage needed per RISS.

HEME...Heparin drip started at 600U/hr.  Goal PTT 40-60.  Needs PTT at 2200.  Pneumoboots in place.

ID...Tmax 99.8.  No abx coverage.

SKIN...No skin issues.

SOCIAL....Pt's multiple children in throughout the day.  Updated on days events per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 816**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1875**].

PLAN...Keep sedated overnight. Steroids. Pulmonary toilet. Possible extubation tomorrow.  Advance TF's as tolerated.  Follow neuro exam. Keep SBP around 140.

RESP-remains intubated and vented on CPAP x 40% + 5 pep and 8 PS. rr has been [**2-3**] with tvs 400-600ccs.sats have been >95% all day.lungs clear, diminished at bases.was sx a few times for small amts thick tan sputum.had 3 cxrs following line insertion attempts-no signs pneumothorax.chest expanding bilaterally.on dexamethasone for laryngeal swelling.

GI-abd is soft with positive bowel sounds.has been smudging tiny amts brown stool.tube feeds of promote with fiber infusing at goal rate of 50/hr. iv protonix changed to lanzoprazole po.

ID-has been afebrile.wbc=5.7. no antibx.

NEURO-was lightly sedated this am, responding to commands all though not following commands consistently. pupils 3mm and briskly reactive.was sedated off and on with propofol boluses for procedures, is now more heavily sedated but arousable-propofol has been returned to pre-procedure dose of 30 mcgs/kg/min.hands are restrained.no signs of seizure activity-dilantin level=7.8- dose was intially increased to 150 mgs iv tid,now changed to 150 po tid,

RHEUM-pt with severe arthritis, c/o joint pain this am, receiving oxycodone q 4 hrs-held at 12n for somnulence.hands look particularly painful.on low dose prednisone and arava.

F/E-has very minimal peripheral edema.urinary output was marginal overnight, was tx with 10 mgs ivp lasix this am with ~1L diuresis, was just tx with an additional 20 mgs lasix and has begun to diurese.receiving only 5 ccs/hr ivf kvo.please see labs as listed in carevue.

ENDO-receiving regular insulin as per sliding scale.

HEME-heparin had been infusing at 650u/hr, was held for several hours during line insertion attempts, briefly back on (x ~ 1hour), now off again.hct this am=33. 

SKIN-is grossly intact-daughter noted swollen nodules on her arthritic fingers which were becoming darkened-she thought they were looking infected-i applied triple antibx ointment and bandaids.

IV ACCESS-has 3 peripheral heplocks in which are all patent.had multiple attempts to place central line but were not successful, both R SC and R IJ. a new L brachial a-line was placed so we can draw labs.

SOCIAL-has several visits from family members. they were updated by this nurse and by Dr [**First Name (STitle) 816**].also teaching done in response to their questions, about testing for tracheal edema prior to extubating pt, and the role of the dexamthasone in tx the edema.

     TECHNIQUE:  Head CT without contrast.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     Again noted is a well-circumscribed, round hyperdensity in the right
     parafalcine location measuring about 1.4 cm representing an aneurysm. This is
     unchanged in appearance compared to the prior study.  Again noted is bilateral

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  78 year old with intracranial aneurysm and poor venous access.
     
     PROCEDURE:  This procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 640**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 551**] with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 250**], the Attending Radiologist, present for the entire procedure.  The
     right upper arm was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Since no
     suitable superficial veins were visible, ultrasound was used for localization
     of a suitable vein.  The basilic vein was patent and compressible.  After
     local anesthesia with approximately 3 cc of 1% lidocaine, the basilic vein was
     entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a 21-gauge needle.  A 0.018 guide
     wire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava.  10 cc of
     non-ionic contrast was used to confirm venous position. Based on the markers
     of the guide wire, it was determined that a length of 35 cm would be suitable.
     The PICC was trimmed to length and advanced over a 4- French introducer sheath
     under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena cava.  The sheath was
     removed and both ports of the catheter were flushed.  A final chest x-ray was
     obtained confirming tip of the PICC within the mid-to- distal superior vena
     cava.  The line is ready for use.  A StatLock was applied and the line was
     heplocked.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 35-cm total length double-lumen PICC in
     the right basilic vein with its tip in the mid-to-distal superior vena cava.
     The line is ready for use.

     COMPARISON:  [**2814-3-31**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired contiguous axial images from the lung apices to the
     pubic symphysis were obtained following the administration of oral and 150 cc
     of IV Optiray.  Nonionic contrast was used secondary to patient request.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The heart, pericardium, and great vessels
     are within normal limits.  There are no enlarged mediastinal, hilar, or
     axillary lymph nodes.  No pericardial or pleural effusions.  Lung window
     images again demonstrate peripheral interlobular septal thickening and
     honeycombing with a basilar predominance, consistent with UIP.  The appearance
     of the lungs is relatively unchanged since the prior examination.  The airways
     are patent to the level of segmental bronchi bilaterally.  A tracheostomy tube
     is present with tip in appropriate location.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver, pancreas, adrenal glands,
     spleen, kidneys, ureters, stomach, and loops of large and small bowel are all
     within normal limits.  A nasogastric tube is seen which is coiled within the
     stomach.  There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.  There is no free air or
     free fluid.  No pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph
     nodes are seen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The distal ureters, bladder, uterus, and
     pelvic loops of bowel are all within normal limits.  There are no fluid
     collections to suggest an abscess and there is no free fluid.  No
     pathologically enlarged inguinal or pelvic lymph nodes are seen.  A Foley
     catheter is noted within the bladder.  There is possible prolapse of the
     rectum.  Within the subcutaneous tissues of the- right lower abdomen, there is
     a small oval soft tissue density seen, likely representing the site of
     subcutaneous injections.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are noted.

     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver, pancreas, adrenal glands,
     spleen, kidneys, ureters, stomach, and loops of large and small bowel are all
     within normal limits.  A nasogastric tube is seen which is coiled within the
     stomach.  There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.  There is no free air or
     free fluid.  No pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph
     nodes are seen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The distal ureters, bladder, uterus, and
     pelvic loops of bowel are all within normal limits.  There are no fluid
     collections to suggest an abscess and there is no free fluid.  No
     pathologically enlarged inguinal or pelvic lymph nodes are seen.  A Foley
     catheter is noted within the bladder.  There is possible prolapse of the
     rectum.  Within the subcutaneous tissues of the- right lower abdomen, there is
     a small oval soft tissue density seen, likely representing the site of
     subcutaneous injections.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are noted.

      infection, now infectious issues resolved.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please place PICC line

     INDICATION:  Infection, need PICC for antibiotics.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 643**] with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 602**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 603**],
     the Attending Radiologist, present and supervising.  The left arm was prepped
     in a sterile fashion. Since no suitable superficial veins were visible
     ultrasound was used for localization of a suitable vein.  The left basilic
     vein was patent and compressible.  After local anesthesia with 2 ml 1%
     lidocaine, the basilic vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a
     21 gauge needle.  0.018 guide wire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the
     superior vena cava.  The PICC line, however, did not move past the left
     brachiocephalic vein.  Upon contrast administration obstruction at this level
     was visualized in multiple collaterals.
     
     The same procedure was repeated on the right arm with a 0.018 guide wire
     advanced under fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava through the right
     brachial vein.  The PICC line was trimmed to length and advanced over a 4
     French introducer sheath under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena
     cava.  The length of the PICC line based on the markers on the guide was 37
     cm.  The sheath was removed.  The catheter was flushed.  A final chest x-ray
     was obtained.  The film demonstrates the tip to be in the superior vena cava
     just above the atrium.
     
     The line is ready for use.
     
     A STAT-lock was applied and the line was HEP-locked.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of 37 cm total length PICC line with the tip
     in the superior vena cava approach from the right brachial vein, ready for
     use.
     
     Left upper extremity venography demonstrated obstruction at the left
     brachiocephalic vein with multiple collaterals.

      78 year old woman with SAH, IVH, known A1-2 aneurysm                            
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please do CT/CTA, assess distal ACA aneurysm                                    
     No contraindications for IV contrast

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Subarachnoid hemorrhage, known A2 segment aneurysm.
     
     NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT 
     
     Exam compared to prior study of [**2814-4-9**].  
     
     FINDINGS:  There is now extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage and some
     intraparenchymal hemorrhage surrounding the previously known aneurysm of the
     A2 portion of the left anterior cerebral artery with the intraparenchymal
     portion extending into the right frontal lobe.  A ventricular shunt catheter
     is in place with the tip in the region of the septum pellucidum and probably
     in the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 67**].  The ventricles are more dilated than on the former
     examination of [**2814-4-9**].  There is substantial interventricular hematoma.
     There is hematoma also in the 4th ventricle and in the aqueduct of Sylvius.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Extensive subarachnoid intraparenchymal and subarachnoid blood as
     described.  Ventricular shunt catheter in place.  Ventriculomegaly.  
     
     CT ANGIOGRAM
     
     The lumen of the aneurysm appears very slightly smaller than on the previous
     examination.  The size of the aneurysm, including the clotted portion, is
     difficult to assess because of the surrounding intraparenchymal hematoma, but
     from one measurement on the non-contrast head CT, one would guess that the
     overall aneurysm size was slightly increased, now measuring 15 mm x 17 mm. The
     CT angiogram is somewhat reduced in quality due to reduction in density of the
     contrast material.  It is probably on a technical basis but could reflect some
     alteration in blood flow to the brain.  
     
     IMPRESSION:  The lumen of the A2 portion of the left anterior cerebral artery
     aneurysm appears slightly smaller than the previous examination, whereas the
     clotted portion of the aneurysm appears slightly larger.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  78-year-old female with intracranial hemorrhage and sepsis.
     Assess for pneumothorax following a failed central line placement.
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST:  Comparison is made to a study performed two hours prior.
     Endotracheal tube remains in stable, satisfactory position.  As before, there
     is evidence of underlying diffuse lung disease, likely IPF or NSIP.  There is
     continued superimposed pulmonary edema, worse since the prior study.  There
     may be very small bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is present.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Interval progression of pulmonary edema superimposed on underlying
     diffuse lung disease.
     
     2)  No pneumothorax.

Nsg admit note:

78 year old female with PMH of HTN,RA,post herpectic neuralgia,right foot drop who presented from OSH unresponsive. Pt has recently been dc'd from [**Hospital1 10**] to [**Hospital1 2**] recovering from right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrage and was recovering well.
Staff at [**Hospital1 2**] found her to be unresponsive this AM and CT at [**Hospital 159**] Hospital demonstrated significant head bleed and tx to [**Hospital1 10**] for futher management.
Ventric drain placed in ER with ICP 15-20(20cm at tragus). Hypotensive
requiring IVF bolus and levophed. Also, febrile to 104.1 and pt placed on sepsis protocol. Lactic acid 6.0 upon arrival to ED and see flowsheet for additional details.
Unresponsive-posturing to pain. Pupils do not react and pt does not have a gag or cough reflex. Repeat CT completed at [**Hospital1 10**] which also demonstrated probable aneurysm rupture with large amt of blood in all ventricles. Loading dose of (1) GM dilantin given.
ST on monitor. CPK MB 10 with troponin 1.1.  EKG done.
Intubated with large amt of blood tinged secretions. See flowsheet for current vent settings and ABG's. LR fluid bolus administered for PCO2 22. 
CA/MG repleted. Urine output adequate. OGT to LCWS. pt vomited in CT SCAN in ED and ? aspirated.
Extremities cool and mottled. Brachial art line placed by MD.
[**First Name (Titles) 2524**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] line placed in the ED.

Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] spoke to son who is the health care proxy. Grim prognosis relayed with much support and information. Son discussed his mother's wishes not to be ""kept alive"" if she were to be severely handicapped.
SW called and up to support family as well as this RN.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] requested to review CT films in more detail and then re-assess pt and then decide on the direction of care.
