Admission Date:  [**3069-12-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**3069-12-21**]

Date of Birth:   [**3004-3-4**]       Sex:  F

Service:  HEPATOBILIARY SURGERY SERVICE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 year-old
female who underwent right colectomy on [**3069-5-4**] for a
moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma that extended
focally to the serosa.  The patient had a follow up CT scan
on [**3069-10-22**] and a PET scan on [**10-30**], which
demonstrated focal FDG activity on the right lobe of the
liver suspicious for metastatic disease.  On review of the
PET scan lesion appeared to be ______ segment of the right
lobe.  MRI on [**11-19**] demonstrated 2.5 cm focus of
increased signal of the right lobe predominantly ______
abutting superior margin of segment six, suspicious for
metastatic disease.  Also an additional subcentimeter
intrahepatic lesion within segment three difficult to
characterize, because of the size.  No adrenal mass was seen.
She was presenting for an elective hepatic resection.

ALLERGIES:  Codeine, Percocet, Percodan, Cipro, intravenous
contrast and Keflex.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg po q day.
2.  Lopressor 75 mg po b.i.d.
3.  Propulsid 20 mg po q.i.d.
4.  Prilosec 20 mg po b.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies a history of alcohol use
and admitted to a sixty pack year smoking history.  Denies
the use of other drugs.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Colon cancer.
2.  Hypertension.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Cholecystectomy in [**3028**], bladder
suspension 1993, two breast nodule excised in [**3060**] and a
history of spinal fusion.  The patient also has a right
hemicolectomy as noted above.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile.  Vital signs
were stable.  Her abdomen had normal bowel sounds, well
healed midline abdominal incision.  No hepatosplenomegaly,
masses or tenderness.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent a segment seven and
segment three resection with an intraoperative ultrasound on
[**3069-12-10**].  She tolerated the procedure well.  The patient had
a postoperative course, which was complicated by respiratory
distress, which occurred on [**3069-12-15**].  The patient was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, aggressively diuresed
and ruled out for myocardial infarction and continued to
improve returning back to baseline tolerating a regular diet,
ambulating well with good O2 saturations.  She was
transferred back out to the floor on postoperative day number
eight and was felt to be ready for discharge on postoperative
number eleven with O2 saturations back up to 96% on room air.
 The patient is afebrile with vital signs stable.  Abdomen
soft, nontender, nondistended with one JP in place with
serosanguinous drainage to be discontinued at an office
follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 339**].  The patient was discharged to
home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post segment three and seven liver resection
secondary to metastatic colon cancer.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
4.  Aortoiliac occlusive disease.
5.  Bilateral foot drop.
6.  Colon cancer.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg po q day.
2.  Lopressor 50 mg po b.i.d.
3.  Colace 100 mg po b.i.d.
4.  Dilaudid one to two tablets po q 4 hours prn pain.
5.  Prilosec 20 mg po b.i.d.
6.  Levaquin 500 mg po q day times ten days.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 339**] on
[**3069-12-23**] two days after discharge for possible removal of JP
and also for evaluation of wound and progression and also
with primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one to two weeks.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INDICATION: History of colon cancer with liver mass, presumed
     metastases for resection.
     
     Scans of the liver demonstrate a 2.6 cm solid isoechoic mass centrally in the
     right lobe of the liver with a small focus of calcification centrally. The
     remainder of the right lobe is clear with no other nodules seen. In the left
     lobe, there is a 1.6 cm hypoechoic nodule in segment 3 which shows a rim-like
     area of increased echogenicity and posterior acoustic shadowing. This has a
     different appearance from the right lobe lesion and represents a discrete
     solid nodule. No other lesions are identified in the left lobe and caudate
     lobe is also clear.
     
     CONCLUSION: Two liver lesions, the right lobe measuring 2.6 cm and having
     appearance typical for colon metastases. The left lobe lesion has a different
     appearance and could represent a second metastases but other possibilities
     such as calcified hemorrhagic cyst, old hematoma or other possibilities should
     be considered.

     HISTORY: Recent hepatic resection, abdominal wall erythema.
     
     COMPARISONS: None.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired axial images were obtained from the lung bases
     to the pubic symphysis without IV contrast. IV contrast was not administered
     due to anaphylatic reaction per patient's family.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are bilateral pleural effusions,
     with the right greater than left. There is bilateral interstitial infiltrates
     consistent with pulmonary edema. This evaluation is somewhat limited of the
     abdomen due to no contrast being administered. However there is an area of low
     density within the right lobe of the liver. Surrounding the resected lesion. A
     cervical clip is seen. Without contrast it is difficult to adequately
     delineate this hypodensity. There is also air within the center of this
     region. This could represent a vascular insult since this is in a vascular
     distribution. If surgical packing used this could also represent an area of
     infection. The gallbladder is not visualized. There are bilateral
     hyperdensities within both kidneys which could represent small stones or they
     could be vascular calcifications. The ureters are normal. The spleen and
     pancreas are unremarkable. The adrenals are unremarkable. The opacified large
     and small bowel are unremarkable. No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or
     retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Multiple drains are seen within the abdomen.
     There is fluid within the subcutaneous tissue consistent with anasarca. There
     is calcification of the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries. No fluid
     collection within the abdomen. No free air. Incidental note is made of an
     intra-atrial septal lipoma. 
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The bladder is normal with the presence
     of a Foley catheter. The sigmoid colon contains diverticula without evidence
     of diverticulosis. There is a small amount of free fluid within the pelvis. No
     inguinal or pelvic pathological lymph nodes.

     Reason: COLORECTAL CANCER.  RESTAGING.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     Indication:  Sixty-six year old female with metastatic colon cancer to the   
     liver.  Colorectal cancer restaging.
     
     FINDINGS:  Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18 
     fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), CT images were obtained for attenuation correction and
     for fusion with emission PET images. (The CT images are not used to diagnose
     disease independently of the PET images).  A series of overlapping emission PET
     images was then obtained. The patient's fasting blood glucose level, measured by
     glucometer before injection of FDG, was 106 mg/dL. The area imaged spanned the
     region from the skull base to the proximal thighs.
     
     Physiologic uptake is seen within the myocardium and liver.  There is a focal
     area of decreased uptake within the right posterior liver, consistent with an
     area of infarction in the locale of the patient's prior partial hepatectomy. 
     This corresponds with an area of low attenuation on the CT scan.  A second focal
     area of decreased attenuation is noted within the anterior left lobe of the
     liver.  No abnormal FDG uptake is seen within this locale and this may relate to
     prior surgery.  There is an area of stranding within the peri-hepatic fat
     anterior to the left lobe of the liver in the midline adjacent to the area of
     anterior low attenuation.  This area of stranding extends into the deep
     subcutaneous fat. This area of fatty stranding demonstrates increased FDG
     activity and likely relates to prior surgery.
     
     The tiny nodule within the anterior left lung does not demonstrate focally
     increased FDG uptake, however this lesion is below the level of sensitivity for
     this study.         
     
     A small focal area of increased uptake is noted within the distal sigmoid colon
     anterior to the rectum.
     
     There are extensive dense vascular calcifications.  The distal abdominal aorta
     is prominent and heavily calcified with a tubular area of calcification located
     along the internal posterior margin of the aorta.  This is unchanged when
     compared to prior CT performed [**3069-12-16**] and may represent sequela of prior old
     dissection.
     
     IMPRESSION:   1) Focal uptake within the distal sigmoid colon may represent 
     normal bowel activity vs tumor.   2) Cold defect within the posterior right lobe
     of the liver is consistent with infarct/surgical change.  A second area of low
     attenuation within the anterior left lobe does not appear FDG avid and may
     relate to prior surgery.  3) FDG-avid fat stranding within the anterior
     abdominal wall, likely relates to prior surgery.

     HISTORY: 66 y/o woman with status post liver resection for metastatic colon
     cancer.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Multiple helically acquired axial images were obtained from the
     chest without intravenous contrast.
     
     COMPARISONS: PET CT [**3070-3-22**] and CT abdomen [**3069-12-16**].
     
     CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST: There is mild emphysema and [**Hospital1 **]-apical parenchymal
     scarring. There are multiple peripheral noncalcified nodules which are less
     than 5 mm in size. There are also bilateral ground glass opacities associated
     with a prominent vasculature. There are no dominant masses or consolidations.
     
     There are small mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes, however, these lymph
     nodes measures less than 1 cm in short axis diameter.  The heart is normal in
     size. The pericardium and great vessels are unremarkable except for extensive
     aortic calcification.  There are coronary artery calcifications. There are no
     pleural or pericardial effusions.
     
     For evaluation of the abdomen please refer to the abdominal CT of [**3069-12-16**] or
     the MRI of [**3070-3-22**].  On bone windows there are no suspicious lesions.

     1) Multiple peripheral noncalcified nodules measuring less than 5 mm. These
     nodules are too small to be detected by a PET scan. They could represent
     noncalcified granulomas or early metastasis. Follow up in 3 months with a
     chest CT is recommended.
     2) Mild emphysema with [**Hospital1 **]-apical scarring.

      65 year old woman with metastatic colon ca
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      66 year old with metastatic colon ca to the liver. s/p colectomy in 4/03, s/p
      segmental liver resection in 11/03.  Last CT of chest in 2/04 showed non
      calcified nodules within the lungs. 6 week follow up CT to assess for
      growth, changes.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Metastatic colon CA to the liver.  Follow up of noncalcified
     nodules on prior CT.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained through the chest without IV
     contrast.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3070-3-30**].
     
     CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST:  The heart size is normal.  There are dense aortic and
     coronary artery calcifications.  There are scattered mildly prominent lymph
     nodes in the mediastinum, including a 10 mm precarinal lymph node.  There are
     no pericardial or pleural effusions.
     
     The patient is status post hepatic resection, and there are low-attenuation
     regions in both right and left hepatic lobes.  The liver is not fully
     evaluated on this study.
     
     Lung windows again demonstrate multiple peripheral noncalcified nodules, which
     measure less than 5 mm in size. These are not changed from the prior exam.
     Also noted is mild emphysema. The airways are patent to the level of the
     segmental bronchi bilaterally.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic abnormalities.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. No change in multiple small pulmonary nodules in both lungs.
     2. Mild emphysema.

     ground glass opacities, primarily at the bases. The appearance is not
     significantly changed from [**3070-8-9**], or from [**3070-5-3**].
     
     The osseous structures reveal no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. There
     is residual gadolinium contrast within the kidneys from prior abdomen MRI.
     Low-attenuation changes with surgical clips are present in the right lobe of
     the liver. The overall low-attenuation area appears smaller than on the prior
     study. The visualized upper abdominal organs are otherwise unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Bilateral pulmonary nodules, stable from [**3070-3-30**]. Given their
     seven-month stability, a six-month followup may be obtained. If there are
     clinical indications of worsening disease, a three-month followup may also be
     obtained.
     
     2. Patchy ground glass opacities with air trapping, stable over multiple prior
     studies. These have a nonspecific appearance and may be due to patient's
     underlying COPD or edema.
     
     3. Low-attenuation liver lesion status post resection. Please refer to abdomen
     MRI performed on same day for better evaluation.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      66 year old woman with metastatic colon ca
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      66 yo s/p segment 3,7 hepatic resection in 11/03 for metastatic colon ca to
      liver, s/p chemotherapy in past 6mos for question of recurrence in liver. Last
      MR abd in 7/04 showed decrease in size of multiple hepatic lesion. Please do 3
      month f/u MR abd to assess for any changes.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Colon cancer, follow up liver metastases.
     
     COMPARISONS:  [**3070-8-9**], [**3070-5-3**], and [**3070-3-22**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI of the liver including T1W in- and out-of-phase,
     HASTE, and 3D dynamic T1W fat sat imaging sequences without and with IV
     gadolinium contrast.  Subtracted images and multiplanar reformatted images
     were generated for further evaluation.
     
     FINDINGS:  Post-surgical resection sites within segments III and VII of the
     liver are unchanged, with no abnormal enhancement.  Multiple previously
     visualized metastases, predominantly within the dome of the liver, continue to
     be much less conspicuous on today's study and are barely discernible.  No new
     lesion is detected.  Within the inferior aspect of segment VI, there is an
     unusual 2.2-cm hypoenhancing region which demonstrates slight signal decrease
     on T1W out-of-phase images, with no significant change compared to the prior
     studies.
      There is a small calcification within the head of the pancreas.  There is
     slight incremental increase in size of the infrarenal abdominal aortic
     aneurysm which now measures 28 x 31 mm.
     
     Both adrenal glands, the spleen, and both kidneys are within normal limits.
     There are two tiny cysts within the mid right kidney.  The patient is status
     post cholecystectomy.
     
     IMPRESSIONS:
     
     1) Continued improved appearance of multiple previously imaged hepatic
     metastases.  These lesions are barely discernible on today's study.
     
     2) Unchanged postsurgical changes within segments III and VII of the liver.
     
     3) Unusual hypoenhancing lesion within the inferior aspect of segment VI of
     the liver, possibly representing focal fatty infiltration.
     
     4) Slight incremental increase in size of the infrarenal abdominal aortic
     aneurysm.
