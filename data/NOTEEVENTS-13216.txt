RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed no infiltrates or
effusions.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 36-year-old gentleman with
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and diabetic
ketoacidosis, and gastrointestinal bleed.

The hematemesis was likely from a small [**Doctor First Name 1148**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tears
from the nausea and vomiting.  The diabetic ketoacidosis was
likely from a poor diet and insulin compliance secondary to
depression and social situation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was was guaiac-positive at
admission.  A nasogastric tube was placed, and NGT lavage showed
a small amount of red blood that quickly cleared.  However, his
hematocrit throughout this admission was stable in the high 30s
and low 40s.

He was given intravenous fluids, potassium, and insulin and had
his sugars monitored to maintain fingerstick blood glucoses
between 140 and 180.

He was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit from [**2879-1-16**] to [**2879-1-17**] when he was transferred to the
floor on the evening of [**2879-1-17**] with a corrected
anion gap of 11.  He continued to remain stable on the floor
and had a change of his diabetes regimen for better control.
He was instructed on his new regimen by the medical team,
then Endocrine consultation from [**Last Name (un) 720**], and a diabetic
teaching nurse.  He was discharged with followup at the
[**Hospital 720**] Clinic.
