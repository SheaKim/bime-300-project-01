Admission Date:  [**2720-4-15**]       Discharge Date:  [**2720-4-19**]

Date of Birth:   [**2679-3-20**]       Sex:  M

Service:  FICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 41-year-old male with
diabetes mellitus type I admitted in diabetic ketoacidosis.
The patient reports going on a drinking binge two to three
days prior to admission and stopped taking his insulin during
this time.  He states that he knew ""something was wrong when
I was in the alley drink a quart of beer and it kept coming
back up.""  He has been vomiting frequently for the past few
days, occasionally with coffee ground material.  He also
reports dry cough and mild abdominal pain.  He denies fever,
chills, diarrhea, bright red blood per rectum, melena, chest
pain or shortness of breath.

The patient was brought to the Emergency Department three
times in the week prior to admission and reportedly left
against medical advice as soon as he started feeling better.
He was brought back to the Emergency Room on the day of
admission by his group home for continued nausea and
vomiting.  His initial labs showed a glucose 296 and a
bicarbonate of 8 with an anion gap of 38.  He was given 1
liter of normal saline and started on an insulin drip in the
Emergency Room.  The patient had approximately 400 cc of
coffee ground emesis in the Emergency Department and a
nasogastric lavage was done which cleared with approximately
200 cc of fluid.  The patient was transferred to the FICU for
further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Significant psych history status post many
hospitalizations and multiple suicide attempts.
2.  History of schizophrenia versus personality disorder
3.  History of alcohol abuse with history of alcohol abuse
with history of withdrawal seizures and DTs
4.  Antisocial personality disorder
5.  Diabetes mellitus type I
6.  History of peptic ulcer disease
7.  Status post appendectomy
8.  History of seizure disorder (unclear if this was only in
the setting of withdrawal)

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Tetracycline 500 mg po bid
2.  Vitamin E
3.  Multivitamin
4.  Benzoyl peroxide
5.  Aciphex 20 mg po q day
6.  Insulin 70/30 38 units q a.m.
7.  NPH insulin 8 units q hs
8.  Regular insulin sliding scale
9.  Enteric coated aspirin
10. Colace
11. Clozaril
12. Paxil
13. Clonazepam
14. Lactulose

ALLERGIES:  THE PATIENT REPORTS ALLERGIES TO NAVANE AND
HALDOL WHICH CAUSE HIM TO BECOME ""STIFF AT HOT.""

FAMILY HISTORY:  Sister and aunt with diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is divorced.  He has lived in a
group home for approximately two weeks after a seven year
hospitalization in the .............. Hospital.  He smokes
one pack tobacco per day.  He is a heavy alcohol user.

ADMISSION LABS:  White count 22.7 with 22% neutrophils, 3.8%
lymphocytes and 3.9% monocytes, hematocrit of 33.3 and
platelets to 231.  His PT was 12.9.  His PTT 22.2, INR of
1.2.  Chem-7 was 140, 4.3, 98, 8, 13, 1.0, 296 with an anion
gap of 38.  His urinalysis showed trace blood, 500 glucose,
greater than 80 ketones, 0 to 2 red blood cells, 0 to 2 white
blood cells and occasional bacteria.  His alcohol level was
71.

IMAGING:  A chest x-ray was done which was within normal
limits.  An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a
rate of 120, normal axis, normal intervals, wavy baseline.
T-wave flattening in leads V6, 3 and AVF which was unchanged
when compared to the electrocardiogram from [**2720-3-15**].

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit primarily for management of his diabetic
ketoacidosis.  The patient was treated with an insulin drip
and aggressive hydration and his lab valves corrected over
the first night of admission.  By the following morning, his
anion gap was closed to 18 and he was started on subcutaneous
insulin and his insulin drip was discontinued.  His potassium
and phosphate were aggressively repleted.  At the time of
discharge, the patient is still receiving NPH 10 units
subcutaneous bid plus a regular insulin sliding scale.  This
is markedly less insulin than his outpatient requirement,
however the patient has not been taking a lot of po intake
during this hospitalization.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had an elevated white
count with a left shift at presentation.  He never developed
any signs or symptoms of infection.  All cultures were
negative.  It was felt that this patient's diabetic
ketoacidosis was likely secondary to medications on
compliance and not triggered by an infectious process.

3.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient has a history of peptic
ulcer disease and presented with a mild upper
gastrointestinal bleed.  This was represented by a hematocrit
down to 33 from 42 in [**2720-3-15**].  This was felt to be
likely a gastritis secondary to chronic alcohol use and daily
aspirin.  The patient was treated with Protonix bid.  His
hematocrit remained stable throughout the hospitalization.
The gastrointestinal service was consulted and they felt that
conservative management was appropriate unless the clinical
deterioration was seen.  The patient should continue his
Protonix bid and can follow up with gastrointestinal as an
outpatient.

4.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  On [**4-17**], the patient developed
""crushing"" chest pain.  This however resolved with treatment
with Maalox.  The patient's cardiac enzymes were cycled and
were negative.  There were no electrocardiogram changes with
this event.

5.  PSYCHIATRY:  The patient was brought to the Emergency
Department under section 12 and was monitored on a 1:1 sitter
during the hospitalization due to threats of wheezing, AMA.
The patient was continued on his home psychiatric medication
regimen.  He also was monitored with a CIWA scale, but
required very little extra benzodiazepines during the
admission.  The psychiatry service in conjunction with the
patient's primary physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] arranged for the patient to
enter a dual diagnosis rehabilitation at discharge.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Diabetic ketoacidosis

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Medically stable for discharge to dual
diagnosis psychiatric/substance abuse rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Protonix 40 mg po bid
2.  Multivitamin
3.  Lamictal 75 mg po tid
4.  Colace 100 mg po bid
5.  Clonazepam 1 mg po tid
6.  Paxil 20 mg po q day
7.  Clozapine 125 mg po bid
8.  Thiamine
9.  Folate
10. NPH 10 units subcutaneous bid
11. Regular insulin sliding scale
12. Lopressor 12.5 mg po bid

     CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  Comparison [**2720-8-27**].  There is a right subclavian line with
     tip in the inferior SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.
     
     The cardiac silhouette is partially obscured but appears to have significantly
     increased in size since the prior exam.  This could be related to adjacent
     parenchymal consolidation.  There is dense consolidation in the left lower
     lobe and likely also in the lingula, new from the prior exam.  There is a new
     left effusion and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  In addition, there is
     increased soft-tissue density in the region of the AP window with deviation of
     the trachea/carina to the right.  There is mild vascular prominence in the
     right lung, which is otherwise clear without focal consolidation or pleural
     effusion.
     
     There is diffuse bony demineralization and loss of height of a few mid and
     lower thoracic vertebral bodies.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Dense consolidations in the left lower lobe and lingula with
     associated volume loss and new left effusion.  Possible left hilar/AP window
     mass with secondary deviation of the trachea to the right.  Equivocally
     enlarged cardiac silhouette vs. apparent enlargement due to adjacent
     parenchymal consolidation.  These findings are all new since the prior exam,
     and CT scan is recommended for further evaluation.

     CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST, [**2-23**]:
     
     INDICATION:  ETOH and new mass on chest x-ray.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial chest CT was performed following administration of 100 cc of
     Optiray.
     
     CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is a large left-sided pleural fluid collection
     which has multiple loculations both anterior and posterior.  The fluid
     demonstrates [**Doctor Last Name **] of 20, suggesting either exudate or an element of hemothorax.
     The effusion causes mass effect and deviates the mediastinal structures to the
     right.  There is atelectasis of the left lower lobe.  An element of pneumonia
     within this atelectasis.  The remaining portions of the left upper lobe are
     predominantly clear.  There is ground-glass attenuation involving most of the
     right upper lobe and right middle lobe.  This is likely due to pneumonia or
     aspiration.  The right lower lobe is clear.  There is no right-sided effusion.
     
     A right-sided subclavian line terminates in the proximal right atrium.
     Assessment for mediastinal lymphadenopathy is difficult given rightward shift
     of mass effect.  However, there may be a subcarinal lymph node measuring 2.6 X
     1.5 cm.
     
     Bone windows reveal an acute rib fracture involving the lateral aspect of the
     left 7th rib, with asymmetric thickening of the chest wall musculature
     suggesting an acute hematoma.  It is suspected that the left-sided effusion is
     a hemothorax due to this acute fracture.  There is no evidence of suspicious
     lytic or blastic skeletal lesions.
     
     Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen reveals no abnormalities of the
     partially imaged liver, spleen, or adrenals.  Please note however that these
     organs are only partially imaged on this chest exam.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Loculated left-sided hemothorax.  Hemothorax is considered most likely
     given the close proximity to the acute left rib fracture with surrounding
     hematoma.  Ultimately, this may represent a loculated empyema.
     2)  Left lower lobe atelectasis, due to mass effect of the effusion.
     3)  Rightward mediastinal shift due to mass effect of left-sided pleural
     fluid.
     4)  Right upper and right middle lobe patchy opacity probably represents
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INDICATION: Endotracheal tube placement.
     
     There has been interval intubation with an endtracheal tube terminating
     approximately 5 cm above the carina. There are several new left-sided chest
     tubes with associated marked decrease in size of previously noted medially
     loculated component of a left pleural effusion. A residual moderate effusion
     remains with some partial loculation laterally.
     
     A nasogastric tube is in satisfactory position as well as a right subclavian
     vascular catheter, terminating at the junction of the superior vena cava and
     right atrium.
     
     Apparent interval decrease in heart size likely reflects improvement of the
     medially loculated component of the left pleural effusion which previously
     obscured the left heart border. There is some patchy consolidation in the left
     mid- and lower lung zones.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Endotracheal tube in satisfactory position.
     2. Improved left pleural effusion with interval placement of several new left-
     sided chest tubes.
