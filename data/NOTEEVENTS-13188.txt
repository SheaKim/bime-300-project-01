     CHEST (PORTABLE AP)                                             Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 13679**]
     Reason: eval for pna, abscess, lung cancer
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      66 year old man with nsclc, hx of lung abscess
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      eval for pna, abscess, lung cancer
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia or abscess in patient with lung cancer.
     
     No prior studies are available for comparison.
     
     AP CHEST:  A portacath is positioned in the right chest and the tip is at the
     junction of the SVC/RA.   There is a somewhat hazy opacification overlying the
     right upper lumg which is consistent with right upper lobe consolidation.  In
     addition, there is slight shift of upper mediastinal structures to the right
     which suggests partial collapse of the right upper lobe.  No pleural effusions
     are identified and no pulmonary nodules or masses are seen.  The pulmonary
     vasculature is within normal limits.  The heart size and  aortic silhouettes
     are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Right upper lobe collapse and consolidation may represent
     pneumonia and atelectasis.  Comparison to prior studies from outside facility
     would be useful in evaluating for change.
