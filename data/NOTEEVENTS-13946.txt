Admission Date:  [**3129-8-20**]     Discharge Date:  [**3129-8-25**]

Date of Birth:   [**3044-1-27**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old
female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension,
and coronary artery disease who is status post recent
anterior myocardial infarction that was treated medically on
[**3129-8-10**].  Patient initially presented at that time with left
V2 through V6.  She was managed medically because infarct was
thought to be complete, and she was hemodynamically stable and
pain-free. She had an in- house echocardiogram
which showed an ejection fraction of 35% which was markedly
reduced from 60% ejection fraction in [**3129-3-25**].

Patient was medically managed and discharged to
developed severe diarrhea and was found to be Clostridium
difficile positive, and started on Flagyl.  The patient had
increased lethargy and weakness with intermittent agitation
and complaints of shortness of breath.  The patient denies
chest pain, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting.  The patient
was initially admitted to the CMED service, however, she had
an echocardiogram in the Emergency Department showing an
ejection fraction of less than 25% as well as apical left
ventricular aneurysm.  The patient also had evidence of
failure on her chest x-ray, but no evidence of new ischemic
changes on her electrocardiogram.

Patient, in the Emergency Department, developed nonsustained
V-tach with diaphoresis and blood pressure in the 80s.
Patient was loaded with amiodarone and then became
bradycardic.  Patient was thus transferred to the CCU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease as stated above.
2. Congestive heart failure as stated above.
3. History of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
4. History of hypertension.
5. History of previous transient ischemic attacks.
6. History of pernicious anemia.
7. History of severe osteoarthritis.
8. History of macular degeneration.
9. History of cataracts.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Lopressor 25 mg po bid.
2. Lisinopril 20 mg po q day.
3. Aspirin 325 mg po q day.
4. Lipitor 10 mg po q day.
5. Digoxin 0.125 mg q day.
6. Lasix 20 mg po q day.
7. Coumadin 4 mg po q day.
8. Multivitamin.
9. Calcium carbonate.
10. Trazodone 50 mg q hs prn.

On arrival in the CCU, the patient's vitals were as follows:
96.3, pulse of 115, blood pressure 129/69, breathing at 40,
sat 93% on room air.  Generally, she was alert, but
confused, oriented only to herself using accessory muscles to
breathe.  HEENT was remarkable for dry mucous membranes.
Neck:  The patient had elevated jugular venous pressure.
Chest:  The patient had crackles bilaterally to half her lung
fields and diminished breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination was notable for an irregular heart
rate and a 2/6 systolic murmur best appreciated at the apex.
The patient's abdomen was benign.  Extremities:  She had 2+
lower extremity edema.  Neurologically, the patient could
follow all commands, move all extremities, and had symmetric
strength.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Patient's INR was 3.0.  Her
white count was 11.8, hematocrit 35.5, platelets 384.
Patient's BUN and creatinine were 85 and 1.7.  Patient's
baseline creatinine is around 1.1.  Patient's cardiac enzymes
were notable for a CPK of 101, which was decreased compared
to discharge from the hospital when it was 345, troponin
which was 24, which was also decreased from discharge when it
was greater than 50.  Urinalysis was positive for nitrates,
but otherwise unremarkable, and chest x-ray as stated above,
bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema and
cardiomegaly.

Electrocardiogram showed an old right bundle branch block,
old ST elevations in V2 through V6, left axis deviation, and
atrial fibrillation.

In short, this is an 85-year-old female with recent anterior
myocardial infarction and severe congestive heart failure now
presenting with confusion in the setting of Clostridium
difficile colitis and dehydration.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Coronary arteries:  The patient was continued on aspirin
and Lipitor.  Patient was deemed not to be a catheterization
candidate.  Patient's enzymes were cycled and patient ruled
out for myocardial infarction.  Patient denied chest pain
throughout the course of her admission.

2. Pump:  Patient had markedly decreased left ventricular
ejection fraction on admission as well as pulmonary edema on
chest x-ray.  Patient received 3 liters of normal saline in
the Emergency Department for question of volume depletion,
where she did have some increase in pressure, but
unfortunately also became markedly short of breath.  The
patient was diuresed and managed with ACE inhibitor to better
increase her forward flow.

The patient's volume status was somewhat unclear throughout
the course of her hospitalization, however, it was decided to
refrain from aggressive-invasive measures such as PA line
catheterization in this patient.

3. Rhythm:  Patient had two runs of sustained V-tach that
required shock.  Patient was symptomatic and blood pressure
dipped into the 80s during these episodes.
Patient was loaded on amiodarone and continued on amiodarone.
Given the patient's propensity to develop further episodes of
V-tach, family discussion ensued regarding patient's code
status.  After much deliberation and discussion, patient's
family decided to make her DNR/DNI. The patient developed
V-tach V-fib arrest early in the morning of [**3129-8-25**], and was
pronounced dead at 12:02 am on [**3129-8-25**].
