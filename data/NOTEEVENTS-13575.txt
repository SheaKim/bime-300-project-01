Amoxicillin / Cephalosporins / Penicillins
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3152**] 
Chief Complaint:
fever
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

 
History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 84 y.o. male nursing home resident who was 
febrile to 103 and hypotensive to 80/56 on the morning of 3/28; 
he had no specific complaints at that time.  On arrival to an 
OSH ED, he remained febrile (104) and hypotensive (80/56).  He 
was given IV fluids, started on vasopressin, and was sent to the 
ICU.  In the ICU, peripheral dopamine was added; he then 
achieved a BP of 105/49.  He was awake, alert, and complaining 
of abdominal pain.  His exam was notable for mild LLQ pain with 
a palpable mass; there was no rebound or hypoactive bowel 
sounds.  His labs showed WBC of 9000 with 41% PMNs and 51% 
bands, Hct 28% (from 30 earlier this month), lactate 2.8, AST 
233, ALT 164, alk phos 767, total bili 2.8, direct bili 1.1, 
amylase 45, creatinine 2.4 (baseline 1.7 earlier this month), 
and Troponin-I 0.71.  His U/A was unremarkable save 150 mg 
protein/dL.  A bedside RUQ U/S was of limited quality due to 
patient movement but did show CBD dilatation (12 mm).  He was 
given aztreonam 2000 mg IV, metronidazole 500 mg IV, vancomycin 
1000 mg IV, levofloxacin 500 mg IV, and hydrocortisone 100 mg 
IV.  Blood cultures were drawn and promptly grew gram negative 
rods in 4 out of 4 bottles.  He was then transferred to the 
[**Hospital1 19**].
.
Here an incomplete KUB showed a non-obstructive bowel gas 
pattern; the lower abdomen and pelvis were excluded from view.  
CXR showed increased interstitial markings bilaterally and no 
pleural effusions.  A retrocardiac density was though to 
represent atelectasis, but a focal area of consolidation was not 
excluded.

 
Past Medical History:
1. bipolar disorder/depression with psychotic features
2. diabetes mellitus type 2
3. hypothyroidism
4. chronic kidney disease (baseline creatinine 1.7)
5. BPH
6. osteoarthritis
7. lung nodule

 
Social History:
There is no known history of alcohol or tobacco use or abuse.  
He is a resident of the [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9306**] nursing home in 
[**Hospital1 3254**].  He is able to feed himself.

Brief Hospital Course:
An ERCP done yesterday (after two units of FFP were infused) 
showed no evidence of choledocholithiasis.  The CBD was 
cannulated and opacified with contrast; no large stone or 
biliary tree strictures were seen.  There were no evidence of 
extrinsic compression, no ductal abnormalities, and no large 
filling defects.  The cystic duct did not fill, due to either 
obstruction or the use of low pressure contrast injection.  A 
biliary stent was placed.
.
A post-ERCP right upper quadrant ultrasound shows gallstones and 
a contracted gall bladder but no other abnormalities.
.
Serial CXRs have shown the evolution of moderate pulmonary edema 
that has been stable for 24 hours; there are also small 
bilateral pleural effusions, greater in the left, that are also 
stable.  The left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity persists.
.
Clinically, the patient was weaned off of vasopressors on the 
day of arrival in the FICU.  He has remained hemodynamically 
stable, and his urine output has been excellent.  He has been 
vigorously hydrated with IV fluids.  He was treated with 
vancomycin, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole on 
admission.  Once the gram-negative rod was identified as a 
quinolone-resistant E. coli, his ciprofloxacin was stopped 
(yesterday afternoon); Stress-dose steroids (hydrocortisone 100 
mg IV q8h) as well as his baseline fludrocortisone were started 
on admission and have been continued.
.
He currently feels tired from being disturbed all day but 
otherwise denies focal complaints.  In particular, he denies 
headache, chest pain, dyspnea, cough, abdominal pain, n/v, 
diarrhea, myalgias, or arthralgias. After meeting with patient 
and family patients plan of care was changed to comfort measures 
only. Plan to transition to hospice care at [**Hospital1 **].

CV:  His SBP has been 100s-1teens, HR 60s SR, he remains off of the pressors and has been given numerous boluses of LR to try and improve his urine output.  His CVP was 16 this afternoon and he has not received further boluses since then.

Resp:  LS with rales at the bases throughout the shift.  His 02 SAT has been in the mid to upper 90s on rebreather mask on 5 liters.

GI:  His ABD is firm and distended, he has pain to palpation, he intermittantly admits to abd pain when his abd is not being palpated.  He went down for an ERCP but nothing was seen to stent, a repeat US showed stones in his CBD, he may have a CT tomorrow.  His sensitivities came back from [**Hospital1 **], it was resistant to cipro so this was d/ced, he conts on vanco, flagy, and aztranam. 

GU:  His U/O has been ~ 15cc/hr, he has been given numerous fluid boluses without a change in his u/o.

Endo:  He was started on an insulin gtt, his blood sugars are now down to 130.

     EXAMINATION:  AP chest.
     
     INDICATION:  Hypoxia.
     
     A single AP view of the chest is obtained [**2981-2-18**] at 10:55 hours and is
     compared to the previous radiograph performed [**2981-2-16**].  The left lower lateral
     portion of the chest is not included on the current film.  Again is seen
     cardiomegaly together with a moderate tortuosity of the aorta.  Within that
     limitation, there appears to have been an increase in the bilateral pleural
     effusions.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion persists.  Left-sided IJ line
     has been removed.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Findings consistent with worsening bilateral pleural effusions and mild
     pulmonary vascular congestion, likely representing failure.

     Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2981-2-18**].
     
     There is new right upper lobe consolidation which might represent either
     infectious process or aspiration.  The bilateral basal consolidations as well
     as pleural effusion are unchanged.  The perihilar haziness is grossly
     unchanged and might represent mild congestive heart failure or volume
     overload.
     
     IMPRESSION:  New right upper lobe consolidation, highly suspicious for
     pneumonia or aspiration.
     
     Mild volume overload versus congestive heart failure.
     
     Unchanged bibasal pleural effusion and consolidation, most likely representing
     atelectasis.

     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  This procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 340**] and Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 250**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 250**], the attending radiologist, was present during the entire
     procedure supervising.  Preprocedure timeout was performed and proper
     identification of the patient and the procedure were confirmed.  The patient
     was placed in supine position on the fluoroscopic table and the left arm was
     prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.  Since no superficial
     veins were available, ultrasound was used to localize a suitable vein. The
     left basilic vein was patent and compressible. Following the administration of
     local anesthesia, the left basilic vein was entered under ultrasonographic
     guidance with a 21- gauge needle.  Hard copy of the ultrasound images were
     obtained pre and post PICC line placement and demonstrated a patent left
     basilic vein.  A 0.018 guide wire was then advanced under fluoroscopy into the
     superior vena cava. The PICC line was trimmed to a length of 52 cm and
     advanced over a 5 French introducer sheath under fluoroscopic guidance into
     the superior vena cava. Sheath was removed. The catheter was flushed.  The
     final spot radiographic image was obtained and demonstrates the tip to be in

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
       84 year old man with cholangitis, dementia, psychosis.                         
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      hypernatremia, needs access for free water and hydration.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Needs access for hydration.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 250**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1345**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 250**], the attending radiologist,
     was present and supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Patient was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  A
     pre-procedure timeout was performed.  The right basilic vein was entered with
     a 21-gauge needle under ultrasonographic guidance.  Pre- and post-cannulation
     images were performed demonstrating vessel patency of the basilic vein.
     
     Following placement of an 0.018-inch guidewire with the tip advanced to the
     distal superior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance, the micropuncture
     needle was exchanged for a microcatheter sheath.  PICC line was trimmed to
     length of 36 cm and placed over the wire with tip overlying the distal SVC.
     The guidewire was removed.  Final fluoroscopic spot image demonstrates tip of
     the PICC line in the distal superior vena cava.  Line was secured to the skin
     with StatLock, flushed and Tegaderm was applied.  No immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Uneventful placement of single-lumen 36-cm right-sided PICC line
     via the right basilic vein.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
       84 year old man with left PICC and left upper extremity swelling               
       
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please evaluate clot burden now with PICC removed.                              
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     STUDY:  Left upper extremity veins.
     
     INDICATION:  Please evaluate clot burden now with PIC line removed.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2981-2-26**].
     
     FINDINGS:  [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler sonography was performed of the left
     internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial veins demonstrating normal
     flow, augmentation, compressibility, and waveforms.  The PIC line has been
     removed from the basilic vein.  This vessel is no longer clearly visible
     likely reflecting complete thrombosis.  Another basilic vessel is identified
     and patent with normal compressibility.  In the level of the antecubital fossa
     extending distally is incomplete echogenic clot with noncompressibility in the
     left cephalic vein, which is not completely occlusive.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Nonocclusive thrombus within the left cephalic vein extending from the
     antecubital fossa to the mid forearm.
     
     2.  Interval removal of basilic PICC with vessel not well visualized
     consistent with complete thrombosis within this vessel.
