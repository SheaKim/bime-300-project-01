Admission Date:  [**3032-5-11**]     Discharge Date:  [**3032-5-17**]

Date of Birth:   [**2973-7-8**]     Sex:  F

Service:  MEDICAL MICU

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Dyspnea and left lung collapse.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old woman
with a 90 pack year smoking history who had worsening dyspnea
and cough for several months which worsened in the three days
prior to admission at [**Hospital 3254**] Hospital on [**3032-5-8**].  She
had chest x-ray in [**3031-9-6**] showing no abnormalities
besides healing rib fractures.  She had endorsed losing 15
pounds over the six months prior to admission because of loss
of appetite.

On admission to [**Hospital1 3254**], the chest x-ray showed complete
opacification of the left lung.  She was taken to
bronchoscopy where a left main stem bronchus neoplasm was
found.  The patient did not tolerate the bronchoscopy well
and was coughing with 02 desaturations.  She was intubated
and underwent biopsies of the left main stem bronchus lesion.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for a rigid bronchoscopy
with possible stent intervention by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Alcohol abuse.
2.  History of narcotic dependence.
3.  History of pneumonia.
4.  Adult ADHD.
5.  History of reactive airways disease/asthma.
6.  History of a left hip fracture in [**3030**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother had ""[**Name2 (NI) 6630**] cancer"" and MI.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Ninety pack year smoking history, quit in
[**3030**].  History of alcohol abuse in the past but reportedly
sober for one year, according to the daughter of the patient.
The patient has also been requiring narcotics for her left
hip fracture since last year and had evidence of dependence.

MEDICATIONS UPON TRANSFER:
1.  Morphine drip.
2.  Versed drip.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Effexor.
2.  Prempro.
3.  Seroquel.
4.  Ativan.
5.  Ritalin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs:
Temperature 99.4, heart rate 106, BP 127/67.  Ventilator
settings at AC 400 by 12 at a PEEP of 5 and 100% FI02.
General:  She was a well appearing intubated woman in no
apparent distress.  HEENT:  Anicteric sclerae and dry
oropharynx.  There was some red bloody secretions in the
endotracheal tube.  Chest:  The chest revealed some very
decreased breath sounds at the left upper lobe.  The right
lung field was clear.  Cardiac:  The cardiac examination
revealed a grade II/VI systolic murmur at the right upper
sternal border radiating to the carotids.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, no distention.  Extremities:  No pedal edema.  She
had good dorsalis pedis pulses.  Neurologic:  The patient
moves all extremities and is intermittently agitated and will
try to sit up from the bed.  She does not respond to voice
nor follows commands but is currently sedated.

LABORATORY DATA UPON PRESENTATION:  White count 13.2,
hematocrit 32, platelets 626,000.  The Chem 7 is unremarkable
with a normal bicarbonate at 22.  CK at the outside hospital
was 130 with a negative troponin.  The ABG on this setting
was 7.31, PC02 49, P02 135 on 100% FI02.  Her coagulations
were normal.  Microbiology results at the outside hospital
showed MSSA from the sputum in the bronchoscopy as well as
[**Female First Name (un) **].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  LEFT BRONCHIAL MASS:  The patient was
kept intubated for signs of hypoventilation upon arrival to
the [**Hospital1 19**] and MICU.  She was stable over the weekend and did
not experience significant blood loss from the biopsy at the
outside hospital.  She continued to have agitation while on
the ventilator but was easily sedated with Ativan, morphine,
and propofol drips.

She was taken for CT of the airway with reconstruction as
well as rigid bronchoscopy on [**3032-5-14**] where the left
main stem bronchus lesion showed a 70% luminal narrowing and
no distal airway patency.  A metal stent was placed with no
resulting inflation of the lung postprocedure.  She remained
intubated showing signs of hypoventilation.  She was also
treated for MSSA pneumonia with Oxacillin initially.  She
also was treated with vancomycin for a temperature while on
Oxacillin.  Additional Gram's stain revealed gram-negative
rods and she was started on ciprofloxacin and then switched
to levofloxacin for concern of gram-negative rod coverage.

The day postbronchoscopy, the family was informed of the
ineffectiveness of the stent regarding her ability to
ventilate that lung.  The patient's family was informed of
the poor prognosis regarding weaning off mechanical
ventilation.  She continued to spike low-grade fevers while
on the Oxacillin and Fluoroquinolone.

She was watched for one day post stent with no improvement in
chest x-ray appearance of the left lung collapse.  It was
determined at this time that the patient probably would not
improve on the ventilator and the patient's daughter agreed
to extubation and comfort measures only for the patient.

It should also be noted that a pleural effusion was noted on
the left lung and 800 cc were drained in the OR during rigid
bronchoscopy when a left chest tube was placed to that side.
Cytology is pending on that specimen but was thought to be
most likely a malignant pleural effusion.

The patient underwent extubation on [**3032-5-16**] and was
administered Ativan and morphine drips, titrating up for
sedation and comfort.  The patient expired early
approximately 5:30 a.m. on [**3032-5-17**].  The family was
notified and they declined a postmortem examination.
