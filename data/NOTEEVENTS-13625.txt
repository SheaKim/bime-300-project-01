Admission Date:  [**2669-4-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2669-5-2**]

Date of Birth:   [**2599-8-2**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIAC SURGERY

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transferred for cardiac catheterization.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69 year old
white male who was transferred from [**Hospital 607**] Hospital for
cardiac catheterization.  He had been sent to the hospital by
his cardiologist to whom it had gone for two syncopal
episodes.  He was transferred to an outside hospital where he
was ruled out for a myocardial infarction.  He has a history
of worsening cardiac function over the last year.

One year prior to admission, he had an episode of difficulty
in talking which was possibly a transient ischemic attack.
He had a stroke workup which involved an echocardiogram
showing ejection fraction of 50% with mild aortic stenosis
and mild mitral regurgitation.  He is now transferred to [**Hospital1 471**] for cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Congestive heart failure with recent echocardiogram
showing ejection fraction of 25%, mild aortic stenosis,
moderate mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation,
mild pulmonary hypertension, dilated severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis.
2.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Right knee arthritis.
5.  Transient ischemic attacks, possible small vessel disease
on magnetic resonance scan.
6.  Polio as a child with no long term side effects.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Aspirin Enteric Coated 325 mg q.d.
2.  Toprol XL 12.5 mg q.d.
3.  Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Glipizide 5 mg q.d.
5.  Simvastatin unknown dose.
6.  Lasix 40 mg q.d.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
service for cardiac catheterization.  He was in stable
condition.  He underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2669-4-15**],
which showed severe three vessel disease.  Cardiothoracic
surgery consultation was obtained at this point.  He was
started on Heparin drip.  Prior to surgery, he had a carotid
ultrasound study which showed less than 40% stenosis in the
left internal carotid artery.

On [**2669-4-19**], he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft
times four with left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending, RSVG segmental to diagonal, RSVG to right
coronary artery to posterolateral.  His intraoperative course
was uneventful, and he was transferred to the CSRU in stable
condition.  He was extubated overnight.

He was noted to have some episodes of confusion and language
difficulty.  The possibility of transient ischemic attack was
raised and a neurology consultation was obtained on
postoperative day one. They recommended a CT scan and a
magnetic resonance scan.  CT scan was done and showed no
acute hemorrhage.

Recommendations were made to keep the systolic blood pressure
about 130 to 140.  It was noted subsequently that when the
patient's systolic blood pressure was below 130, he would be
symptomatic with language difficulties and a seizure.  He
underwent a magnetic resonance scan on [**2669-4-22**], which showed
a small area of restricted diffusion in the right prefrontal
subcortical area and also showed right internal carotid
artery and left middle cerebral artery narrowing with
significant intracranial disease.  Per neurology
recommendations, he was started on Coumadin and Aspirin.

Over the next few days, he continued to have episodes of
transient ischemic attacks.  His electroencephalogram was
negative at this point.  He continued to be on a
Neo-Synephrine drip to his blood pressure about 130s to
prevent transient ischemic attacks.  He was hemodynamically
stable with the only issue being the transient ischemic
attacks at this point.

Because of his continuing condition, it was decided to
surgically intervene at this point.  On [**2669-4-27**], he
underwent a cerebral angiography with stenting of the right
internal carotid artery stenosis using two stents.  He was
neurologically stable postoperatively and continued on his
Heparin drip.

Subsequently, he was deemed ready for transfer to the regular
floor.  Per neurology recommendations, he was continued on
Aspirin and Plavix and will continue on it for some time in
the future.  He was transferred to the regular floor on
[**2669-4-30**], in stable condition.  Currently, he is able to
ambulate well.  His pain is under control with p.o.
analgesics.  He is now ready for discharge home.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lasix 40 mg q.d.
2.  Potassium Chloride 20 mEq q.d.
3.  Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
4.  Aspirin Enteric Coated 325 mg q.d.
5.  Plavix 75 mg q.d.
6.  Amiodarone 400 mg q.d.
7.  Glipizide 5 mg q.d.
8.  Lisinopril 5 mg q.d.
9.  Percocet one to two tablets q4-6hours p.r.n.

FO[**Last Name (STitle) 1533**]P:  Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2**] in clinic in four weeks,
follow-up with primary care physician in two weeks, and with
neurology in four weeks.

     INDICATION:  Postop TIA's.  Clean carotids.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2 weighted images as well as diffusion
     weighting FLAIR and in susceptibility images were performed through the brain.
     3D time of flight images of the circle of [**Location (un) **] and its tributaries were also
     obtained with multiplanar reconstructions.
     
     MRI OF THE BRAIN:  On diffusion weighted imaging, there are a few areas of
     restricted diffusion.  The largest is in the right posterior frontal region.
     There are three regions within the left cortex, one in the posterior frontal
     lobe, one in the parietal lobe and a small one in the inferior temporal lobe.
     The right region corresponds to areas of T2 hyperintensity on T2 and FLAIR
     imaging.  The punctate areas in the left lobe are difficulty to match up with
     the T2 and FLAIR imaging but likely have corresponding areas of T2
     hyperintensity.  There are additional areas of T2 hyperintensity in the
     periventricular white matter likely related to chronic ischemic changes. There
     is no intra or extra-axial hemorrhage.  There is no shift of normally midline
     structures or mass effect.  The ventricles and cisterns are unremarkable. The
     soft tissues and sinuses are within normal limits.
     
     MRA OF THE BRAIN:  In the right internal carotid, there is an area of
     decreased signal at the junction of the petrous and posterior cavernous
     portions.  It cannot be determined if this is due to a stenosis or diminutive
     flow.  No other areas of abnormal flow are noted.  The source data was
     reviewed.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Punctate areas of increased diffusion within both hemispheres.
     This is consistent with subacute areas of ischemia.  Given the bilateral
     distribution, likely related to embolic phenomenon.  Chronic small vessel
     ischemic changes as well.  Decreased signal within the right internal carotid
     artery as described above.

      69 year old man with ? aneurysm.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      diagnostic cerebral angiogram with intracranial angioplasty.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Right intracranial internal carotid artery stenosis.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same, status post stent angioplasty of internal
     carotid artery stenosis.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  Monitored anesthesia care followed by general endotracheal
     anesthesia.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **]  INDICATION:  This gentleman is a 69 year old man who underwent a coronary
     artery bypass procedure by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1998**] which was followed by an episode of
     confusion when the patient's blood pressure dropped below 130 mm Hg.  He
     underwent an MR angiogram which revealed the presence of a high-grade stenosis
     in the petrocavernous segment of the internal carotid artery.  He is
     undergoing this diagnostic angiogram with a possibility of providing
     revascularization and intracranial stent angioplasty.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient was given a full and complete explanation of the
     procedure including the risk of stroke, coma, death, vessel rupture, vessel
     injury, as well as other unforeseen complications.  The patient and his family
     understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought into the Endovascular Suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right and left groin areas were
     prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 5-French vascular sheath
     was inserted into the left common femoral artery after administering
     subcutaneous lidocaine.  This was performed over a wire and the sheath was
     kept on a heparinized saline flush during the entirety of the procedure.  At
     this point, a 5-French Berenstein catheter was used to selectively catheterize
     these vessels in following succession:  right common carotid artery, left
     subclavian artery, left vertebral artery, left common carotid artery, left
     internal carotid artery.  The catheter was then withdrawn from the patient. At
     this point, review of the studies revealed a mild-to-moderate stenosis at the

     rotational angiogram clearly delineated a greater-than-90% stenosis of the
     right internal carotid artery in its high petrous segment at the
     petrocavernous junction.  This stenosis is followed by a poststenotic
     dilatation with the caliber of the carotid in that segment approximately 4 to
     4.5 mm, whereas the caliber at the stenosis is less than .9 mm.  In addition,
     the internal carotid artery on the right side provides the dominant flow for
     the anterior cerebral arteries as the right A1 segment is the dominant one
     providing flow to both distal anterior cerebral arteries.  Consequently, the
     decision was made to proceed with the treatment of the symptomatic high-grade
     lesion.  To that end, the patient's activated clotting time was increased to
     around 250 seconds with administration of additional heparin intravenously and
     the 5-French vascular sheath was exchanged for a 7-French vascular sheath and
     a 7-French guide catheter was introduced into the right common carotid artery
     proximal to the bifurcation over a wire and 5-French catheter.  With the guide
     catheter in this position, a series of angiographic runs was performed, and
     once the appropriate position was chosen for performing the procedure, an AVE
     stent angioplasty catheter of type S7 4 mm x 15 mm was gently guided across
     the stenosis and deployed under low pressure.  At this point, this resulted in
     complete resolution of the stenosis which was the target lesion for treatment,
     however, distally at the petrocavernous junction which was the transition
     between the poststenotic dilatation and the distal internal carotid artery, a
     stenosis which previously measured approximately 30% appeared to be somewhat
     worsened by a tiny dissection flap.  Accordingly, a decision was made to treat
     this in order to prevent it from progressively worsening and to that end, a
     3.5 mm x [**Street Address 1999**] S7 stent was navigated across the first stent and across the
     distal stenosis and inflated again under low pressure.  This resulted in
     excellent result with tacking of the dissection flap and resolution of the
     stenosis.  Multiple angiographic runs were performed in various projections to
     document both the post-stent angioplasty result as well as to ensure the
     absence of any intracranial distal branch occlusions.
     
     RESULTS:  Injection of the right common carotid artery revealed the presence
     of an approximately 30% stenosis at the proximal right internal carotid
     artery.  Injection of the left subclavian artery revealed no significant
     stenosis of the left subclavian artery or of its branches.  The left vertebral
     artery has somewhat of a tortuous origin, however, there are no stenoses
     present.  Injection of the right common carotid artery reveals the right
     internal carotid artery to also have a critical stenosis visualized by 3D
     angiography to be greater than 85-90% at the petrocavernous junction and an
     additional distal stenosis of 30% at the proximal cavernous segment.  These
     two stenoses were treated successfully using deployment of two intracranial
     stents with resolution of the stenosis.  There were no distal branch
     occlusions to suggest any embolic events.  Injection of the left common
     carotid artery revealed minimal changes at the bifurcation but no significant
     or hemodynamically-significant stenosis.  The left internal carotid artery
     provides mainly the left middle cerebral artery and has an atretic left A1

      diagnostic cerebral angiogram with intracranial angioplasty.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Right intracranial internal carotid artery stenosis.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same, status post stent angioplasty of internal
     carotid artery stenosis.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  Monitored anesthesia care followed by general endotracheal
     anesthesia.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **]  INDICATION:  This gentleman is a 69 year old man who underwent a coronary
     artery bypass procedure by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1998**] which was followed by an episode of
     confusion when the patient's blood pressure dropped below 130 mm Hg.  He
     underwent an MR angiogram which revealed the presence of a high-grade stenosis
     in the petrocavernous segment of the internal carotid artery.  He is
     undergoing this diagnostic angiogram with a possibility of providing
     revascularization and intracranial stent angioplasty.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient was given a full and complete explanation of the
     procedure including the risk of stroke, coma, death, vessel rupture, vessel
     injury, as well as other unforeseen complications.  The patient and his family
     understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought into the Endovascular Suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right and left groin areas were
     prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 5-French vascular sheath
     was inserted into the left common femoral artery after administering
     subcutaneous lidocaine.  This was performed over a wire and the sheath was
     kept on a heparinized saline flush during the entirety of the procedure.  At
     this point, a 5-French Berenstein catheter was used to selectively catheterize
     these vessels in following succession:  right common carotid artery, left
     subclavian artery, left vertebral artery, left common carotid artery, left
     internal carotid artery.  The catheter was then withdrawn from the patient. At
     this point, review of the studies revealed a mild-to-moderate stenosis at the
     right common carotid artery bifurcation, however, a three-dimensional
                                                                 (Over)

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      69 year old man with ? aneurysm.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      diagnostic cerebral angiogram with intracranial angioplasty.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Right intracranial internal carotid artery stenosis.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same, status post stent angioplasty of internal
     carotid artery stenosis.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  Monitored anesthesia care followed by general endotracheal
     anesthesia.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **]  INDICATION:  This gentleman is a 69 year old man who underwent a coronary
     artery bypass procedure by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1998**] which was followed by an episode of
     confusion when the patient's blood pressure dropped below 130 mm Hg.  He
     underwent an MR angiogram which revealed the presence of a high-grade stenosis
     in the petrocavernous segment of the internal carotid artery.  He is
     undergoing this diagnostic angiogram with a possibility of providing
     revascularization and intracranial stent angioplasty.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient was given a full and complete explanation of the
     procedure including the risk of stroke, coma, death, vessel rupture, vessel
     injury, as well as other unforeseen complications.  The patient and his family
     understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought into the Endovascular Suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right and left groin areas were
     prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 5-French vascular sheath
     was inserted into the left common femoral artery after administering
     subcutaneous lidocaine.  This was performed over a wire and the sheath was
     kept on a heparinized saline flush during the entirety of the procedure.  At
     this point, a 5-French Berenstein catheter was used to selectively catheterize
     these vessels in following succession:  right common carotid artery, left
     subclavian artery, left vertebral artery, left common carotid artery, left
     internal carotid artery.  The catheter was then withdrawn from the patient. At
     this point, review of the studies revealed a mild-to-moderate stenosis at the
     right common carotid artery bifurcation, however, a three-dimensional
                                                                 (Over)

     rotational angiogram clearly delineated a greater-than-90% stenosis of the
     right internal carotid artery in its high petrous segment at the
     petrocavernous junction.  This stenosis is followed by a poststenotic
     dilatation with the caliber of the carotid in that segment approximately 4 to
     4.5 mm, whereas the caliber at the stenosis is less than .9 mm.  In addition,
     the internal carotid artery on the right side provides the dominant flow for
     the anterior cerebral arteries as the right A1 segment is the dominant one
     providing flow to both distal anterior cerebral arteries.  Consequently, the
     decision was made to proceed with the treatment of the symptomatic high-grade
     lesion.  To that end, the patient's activated clotting time was increased to
     around 250 seconds with administration of additional heparin intravenously and
     the 5-French vascular sheath was exchanged for a 7-French vascular sheath and
     a 7-French guide catheter was introduced into the right common carotid artery
     proximal to the bifurcation over a wire and 5-French catheter.  With the guide
     catheter in this position, a series of angiographic runs was performed, and
     once the appropriate position was chosen for performing the procedure, an AVE
     stent angioplasty catheter of type S7 4 mm x 15 mm was gently guided across
     the stenosis and deployed under low pressure.  At this point, this resulted in
     complete resolution of the stenosis which was the target lesion for treatment,
     however, distally at the petrocavernous junction which was the transition
     between the poststenotic dilatation and the distal internal carotid artery, a
     stenosis which previously measured approximately 30% appeared to be somewhat
     worsened by a tiny dissection flap.  Accordingly, a decision was made to treat
     this in order to prevent it from progressively worsening and to that end, a
     3.5 mm x [**Street Address 1999**] S7 stent was navigated across the first stent and across the
     distal stenosis and inflated again under low pressure.  This resulted in
     excellent result with tacking of the dissection flap and resolution of the
     stenosis.  Multiple angiographic runs were performed in various projections to
     document both the post-stent angioplasty result as well as to ensure the
     absence of any intracranial distal branch occlusions.
     
     RESULTS:  Injection of the right common carotid artery revealed the presence
     of an approximately 30% stenosis at the proximal right internal carotid
     artery.  Injection of the left subclavian artery revealed no significant
     stenosis of the left subclavian artery or of its branches.  The left vertebral
     artery has somewhat of a tortuous origin, however, there are no stenoses
     present.  Injection of the right common carotid artery reveals the right
     internal carotid artery to also have a critical stenosis visualized by 3D
     angiography to be greater than 85-90% at the petrocavernous junction and an
     additional distal stenosis of 30% at the proximal cavernous segment.  These
     two stenoses were treated successfully using deployment of two intracranial
     stents with resolution of the stenosis.  There were no distal branch
     occlusions to suggest any embolic events.  Injection of the left common
     carotid artery revealed minimal changes at the bifurcation but no significant
     or hemodynamically-significant stenosis.  The left internal carotid artery
     provides mainly the left middle cerebral artery and has an atretic left A1
                                                                 (Over)

     Both the external carotid artery on the right and on the left showed normal
     anatomy with no evidence of arteriovenous shunting and the injection of the
     left vertebral artery intracranially shows no evidence of aneurysm or
     arteriovenous malformation although there is a low tortuosity in the
     intracranial segment of the vertebral artery.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Right intracranial internal carotid artery stenosis.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same, status post stent angioplasty of internal
     carotid artery stenosis.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  Monitored anesthesia care followed by general endotracheal
     anesthesia.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **]  INDICATION:  This gentleman is a 69 year old man who underwent a coronary
     artery bypass procedure by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1998**] which was followed by an episode of
     confusion when the patient's blood pressure dropped below 130 mm Hg.  He
     underwent an MR angiogram which revealed the presence of a high-grade stenosis
     in the petrocavernous segment of the internal carotid artery.  He is
     undergoing this diagnostic angiogram with a possibility of providing
     revascularization and intracranial stent angioplasty.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient was given a full and complete explanation of the
     procedure including the risk of stroke, coma, death, vessel rupture, vessel
     injury, as well as other unforeseen complications.  The patient and his family
     understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought into the Endovascular Suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right and left groin areas were
     prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 5-French vascular sheath
     was inserted into the left common femoral artery after administering
     subcutaneous lidocaine.  This was performed over a wire and the sheath was
     kept on a heparinized saline flush during the entirety of the procedure.  At
     this point, a 5-French Berenstein catheter was used to selectively catheterize
     these vessels in following succession:  right common carotid artery, left
     subclavian artery, left vertebral artery, left common carotid artery, left
     internal carotid artery.  The catheter was then withdrawn from the patient. At
     this point, review of the studies revealed a mild-to-moderate stenosis at the
     right common carotid artery bifurcation, however, a three-dimensional
                                                                 (Over)

     rotational angiogram clearly delineated a greater-than-90% stenosis of the
     right internal carotid artery in its high petrous segment at the
     petrocavernous junction.  This stenosis is followed by a poststenotic
     dilatation with the caliber of the carotid in that segment approximately 4 to
     4.5 mm, whereas the caliber at the stenosis is less than .9 mm.  In addition,
     the internal carotid artery on the right side provides the dominant flow for
     the anterior cerebral arteries as the right A1 segment is the dominant one
     providing flow to both distal anterior cerebral arteries.  Consequently, the
     decision was made to proceed with the treatment of the symptomatic high-grade
     lesion.  To that end, the patient's activated clotting time was increased to
     around 250 seconds with administration of additional heparin intravenously and
     the 5-French vascular sheath was exchanged for a 7-French vascular sheath and
     a 7-French guide catheter was introduced into the right common carotid artery
     proximal to the bifurcation over a wire and 5-French catheter.  With the guide
     catheter in this position, a series of angiographic runs was performed, and
     once the appropriate position was chosen for performing the procedure, an AVE
     stent angioplasty catheter of type S7 4 mm x 15 mm was gently guided across
     the stenosis and deployed under low pressure.  At this point, this resulted in
     complete resolution of the stenosis which was the target lesion for treatment,
     however, distally at the petrocavernous junction which was the transition
     between the poststenotic dilatation and the distal internal carotid artery, a
     stenosis which previously measured approximately 30% appeared to be somewhat
     worsened by a tiny dissection flap.  Accordingly, a decision was made to treat
     this in order to prevent it from progressively worsening and to that end, a
     3.5 mm x [**Street Address 1999**] S7 stent was navigated across the first stent and across the
     distal stenosis and inflated again under low pressure.  This resulted in
     excellent result with tacking of the dissection flap and resolution of the
     stenosis.  Multiple angiographic runs were performed in various projections to
     document both the post-stent angioplasty result as well as to ensure the
     absence of any intracranial distal branch occlusions.
     
     RESULTS:  Injection of the right common carotid artery revealed the presence
     of an approximately 30% stenosis at the proximal right internal carotid
     artery.  Injection of the left subclavian artery revealed no significant
     stenosis of the left subclavian artery or of its branches.  The left vertebral
     artery has somewhat of a tortuous origin, however, there are no stenoses
     present.  Injection of the right common carotid artery reveals the right
     internal carotid artery to also have a critical stenosis visualized by 3D

     rotational angiogram clearly delineated a greater-than-90% stenosis of the
     right internal carotid artery in its high petrous segment at the
     petrocavernous junction.  This stenosis is followed by a poststenotic
     dilatation with the caliber of the carotid in that segment approximately 4 to
     4.5 mm, whereas the caliber at the stenosis is less than .9 mm.  In addition,
     the internal carotid artery on the right side provides the dominant flow for
     the anterior cerebral arteries as the right A1 segment is the dominant one
     providing flow to both distal anterior cerebral arteries.  Consequently, the
     decision was made to proceed with the treatment of the symptomatic high-grade
     lesion.  To that end, the patient's activated clotting time was increased to
     around 250 seconds with administration of additional heparin intravenously and
     the 5-French vascular sheath was exchanged for a 7-French vascular sheath and
     a 7-French guide catheter was introduced into the right common carotid artery
     proximal to the bifurcation over a wire and 5-French catheter.  With the guide
     catheter in this position, a series of angiographic runs was performed, and
     once the appropriate position was chosen for performing the procedure, an AVE
     stent angioplasty catheter of type S7 4 mm x 15 mm was gently guided across
     the stenosis and deployed under low pressure.  At this point, this resulted in
     complete resolution of the stenosis which was the target lesion for treatment,
     however, distally at the petrocavernous junction which was the transition
     between the poststenotic dilatation and the distal internal carotid artery, a
     stenosis which previously measured approximately 30% appeared to be somewhat
     worsened by a tiny dissection flap.  Accordingly, a decision was made to treat
     this in order to prevent it from progressively worsening and to that end, a
     3.5 mm x [**Street Address 1999**] S7 stent was navigated across the first stent and across the
     distal stenosis and inflated again under low pressure.  This resulted in
     excellent result with tacking of the dissection flap and resolution of the
     stenosis.  Multiple angiographic runs were performed in various projections to
     document both the post-stent angioplasty result as well as to ensure the
     absence of any intracranial distal branch occlusions.
     
     RESULTS:  Injection of the right common carotid artery revealed the presence
     of an approximately 30% stenosis at the proximal right internal carotid
     artery.  Injection of the left subclavian artery revealed no significant
     stenosis of the left subclavian artery or of its branches.  The left vertebral
     artery has somewhat of a tortuous origin, however, there are no stenoses
     present.  Injection of the right common carotid artery reveals the right
     internal carotid artery to also have a critical stenosis visualized by 3D
     angiography to be greater than 85-90% at the petrocavernous junction and an
     additional distal stenosis of 30% at the proximal cavernous segment.  These
     two stenoses were treated successfully using deployment of two intracranial
     stents with resolution of the stenosis.  There were no distal branch
     occlusions to suggest any embolic events.  Injection of the left common
     carotid artery revealed minimal changes at the bifurcation but no significant
     or hemodynamically-significant stenosis.  The left internal carotid artery
     provides mainly the left middle cerebral artery and has an atretic left A1

      diagnostic cerebral angiogram with intracranial angioplasty.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Right intracranial internal carotid artery stenosis.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same, status post stent angioplasty of internal
     carotid artery stenosis.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  Monitored anesthesia care followed by general endotracheal
     anesthesia.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **]  INDICATION:  This gentleman is a 69 year old man who underwent a coronary
     artery bypass procedure by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1998**] which was followed by an episode of
     confusion when the patient's blood pressure dropped below 130 mm Hg.  He
     underwent an MR angiogram which revealed the presence of a high-grade stenosis
     in the petrocavernous segment of the internal carotid artery.  He is
     undergoing this diagnostic angiogram with a possibility of providing
     revascularization and intracranial stent angioplasty.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient was given a full and complete explanation of the
     procedure including the risk of stroke, coma, death, vessel rupture, vessel
     injury, as well as other unforeseen complications.  The patient and his family
     understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought into the Endovascular Suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right and left groin areas were
     prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 5-French vascular sheath
     was inserted into the left common femoral artery after administering
     subcutaneous lidocaine.  This was performed over a wire and the sheath was
     kept on a heparinized saline flush during the entirety of the procedure.  At
     this point, a 5-French Berenstein catheter was used to selectively catheterize
     these vessels in following succession:  right common carotid artery, left
     subclavian artery, left vertebral artery, left common carotid artery, left
     internal carotid artery.  The catheter was then withdrawn from the patient. At
     this point, review of the studies revealed a mild-to-moderate stenosis at the
     right common carotid artery bifurcation, however, a three-dimensional
                                                                 (Over)

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      69 year old man with ? aneurysm.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      diagnostic cerebral angiogram with intracranial angioplasty.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Right intracranial internal carotid artery stenosis.
     
     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same, status post stent angioplasty of internal
     carotid artery stenosis.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  Monitored anesthesia care followed by general endotracheal
     anesthesia.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **]  INDICATION:  This gentleman is a 69 year old man who underwent a coronary
     artery bypass procedure by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1998**] which was followed by an episode of
     confusion when the patient's blood pressure dropped below 130 mm Hg.  He
     underwent an MR angiogram which revealed the presence of a high-grade stenosis
     in the petrocavernous segment of the internal carotid artery.  He is
     undergoing this diagnostic angiogram with a possibility of providing
     revascularization and intracranial stent angioplasty.
     
     CONSENT:  The patient was given a full and complete explanation of the
     procedure including the risk of stroke, coma, death, vessel rupture, vessel
     injury, as well as other unforeseen complications.  The patient and his family
     understood and wished to proceed with the operation.
     
     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought into the Endovascular Suite and
     placed on the table in supine position.  The right and left groin areas were
     prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 5-French vascular sheath
     was inserted into the left common femoral artery after administering
     subcutaneous lidocaine.  This was performed over a wire and the sheath was
     kept on a heparinized saline flush during the entirety of the procedure.  At
     this point, a 5-French Berenstein catheter was used to selectively catheterize
     these vessels in following succession:  right common carotid artery, left
     subclavian artery, left vertebral artery, left common carotid artery, left
     internal carotid artery.  The catheter was then withdrawn from the patient. At
     this point, review of the studies revealed a mild-to-moderate stenosis at the
     right common carotid artery bifurcation, however, a three-dimensional
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     (Cont)
     rotational angiogram clearly delineated a greater-than-90% stenosis of the
     right internal carotid artery in its high petrous segment at the
     petrocavernous junction.  This stenosis is followed by a poststenotic
     dilatation with the caliber of the carotid in that segment approximately 4 to
     4.5 mm, whereas the caliber at the stenosis is less than .9 mm.  In addition,
     the internal carotid artery on the right side provides the dominant flow for
     the anterior cerebral arteries as the right A1 segment is the dominant one
     providing flow to both distal anterior cerebral arteries.  Consequently, the
     decision was made to proceed with the treatment of the symptomatic high-grade
     lesion.  To that end, the patient's activated clotting time was increased to
     around 250 seconds with administration of additional heparin intravenously and
     the 5-French vascular sheath was exchanged for a 7-French vascular sheath and
     a 7-French guide catheter was introduced into the right common carotid artery
     proximal to the bifurcation over a wire and 5-French catheter.  With the guide
     catheter in this position, a series of angiographic runs was performed, and
     once the appropriate position was chosen for performing the procedure, an AVE
     stent angioplasty catheter of type S7 4 mm x 15 mm was gently guided across
     the stenosis and deployed under low pressure.  At this point, this resulted in
     complete resolution of the stenosis which was the target lesion for treatment,
     however, distally at the petrocavernous junction which was the transition
     between the poststenotic dilatation and the distal internal carotid artery, a
     stenosis which previously measured approximately 30% appeared to be somewhat
     worsened by a tiny dissection flap.  Accordingly, a decision was made to treat
     this in order to prevent it from progressively worsening and to that end, a
     3.5 mm x [**Street Address 1999**] S7 stent was navigated across the first stent and across the
     distal stenosis and inflated again under low pressure.  This resulted in
     excellent result with tacking of the dissection flap and resolution of the
     stenosis.  Multiple angiographic runs were performed in various projections to
     document both the post-stent angioplasty result as well as to ensure the
     absence of any intracranial distal branch occlusions.
     
     RESULTS:  Injection of the right common carotid artery revealed the presence
     of an approximately 30% stenosis at the proximal right internal carotid
     artery.  Injection of the left subclavian artery revealed no significant
     stenosis of the left subclavian artery or of its branches.  The left vertebral
     artery has somewhat of a tortuous origin, however, there are no stenoses
     present.  Injection of the right common carotid artery reveals the right
     internal carotid artery to also have a critical stenosis visualized by 3D
     angiography to be greater than 85-90% at the petrocavernous junction and an
     additional distal stenosis of 30% at the proximal cavernous segment.  These
     two stenoses were treated successfully using deployment of two intracranial
     stents with resolution of the stenosis.  There were no distal branch
     occlusions to suggest any embolic events.  Injection of the left common
     carotid artery revealed minimal changes at the bifurcation but no significant
     or hemodynamically-significant stenosis.  The left internal carotid artery
     provides mainly the left middle cerebral artery and has an atretic left A1
                                                                 (Over)

     segment.  There are no intracranial aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations.
     Both the external carotid artery on the right and on the left showed normal
     anatomy with no evidence of arteriovenous shunting and the injection of the
     left vertebral artery intracranially shows no evidence of aneurysm or
     arteriovenous malformation although there is a low tortuosity in the
     intracranial segment of the vertebral artery.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Critical stenosis of the intracranial portion of the right
     internal carotid artery treated successfully using tandem intracranial stents
     with good angiographic result and no evidence of distal branch occlusion.

     ARTERIAL DUPLEX LOWER EXTREMITY:
     
     REASON:  Patient with cyanosis and loss of distal foot pulses.
     
     FINDINGS:  Doppler evaluation was performed of both lower extremity arterial
     systems at rest.
     
     On the right Doppler tracings are triphasic at all levels from the femoral to
     the dorsalis pedis.  The ankle/brachial index is 1.06.  Pulse volume
     recordings show some drop off at the metatarsal level.
     
     On the left Doppler tracings are triphasic at all levels from the femoral to
     the dorsalis pedis.  The ankle/brachial index is 1.10.  Pulse volume
     recordings show some drop off at the metatarsal level.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Normal triphasic flow from the femoral to the dorsalis pedis
     arteries.  However based on diminished amplitude of distal pulse volume
     recordings this may be consistent with poor cardiac function.  Clinical
     correlation is warranted.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Seventy year old male with h/o ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy,  
     reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%, s/p CABG x [**2669-4-9**].  Now
     with class 2 anginal symptoms.
      
     SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB:
      
     Exercise protocol:  Modified [**Doctor First Name 216**].
     Exercise duration:  6 minutes.   
     Percent maximum predicted heart rate obtained:  60%.
     Symptoms during exercise:  none.
     Reason exercise terminated:  
     ECG findings:  sinus rhythm with an isolated APB.  Complete RBBB.  At peak
     exercise there was a 0.5-1.0 mm horizontal ST segment depression in leads V5 and
     V6 which resolved to baseline by late recovery.  There was an appropriate
     hemodynamic response to imposed demands in the setting of beta blockade therapy.
      
     INTERPRETATION: 
      
     Imaging Protocol: gated SPECT.
      
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tl-201.
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.
     Exercise images were obtained with Tc-99m sestamibi.
      
     Stress images show a slightly increased left ventricular cavity size compared to
     the resting images.  A medium sized, moderately severe perfusion defect is
     identified in the inferior and inferolateral walls which demonstrates
     predominant reversibility on resting perfusion images.
      
     Ejection fraction calculated from gated SPECT wall motion images obtained after
     exercise is 30%, with global hypokinesis.  The calculated left ventricular end
     diastolic volume is 179 ml.
      
     IMPRESSION:  1) Medium sized, moderately severe, predominately reversible
     perfusion defect involving the inferior extending into inferolateral wall.  2)
     Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction estimated at 30% with global
     hypokinesis.  3) Dilated left ventricular cavity with an estimated end diastolic
     volume of 179 ml. /nkg
