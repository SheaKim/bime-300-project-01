Admission Date:  [**2828-5-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2828-6-2**]

Date of Birth:   [**2742-9-1**]       Sex:  M

Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85 year old
male with the chief complaint of left lower extremity
ischemia, who presented with worsening pain times three days
in the distal left foot, which has been persistent.  The
patient had some intermittent pain the day prior.  The
patient had positive tingling and numbness and decreased
ability to move the foot and toes.  The foot was also cool
and discolored.  The patient denies any coronary artery
disease, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, diabetes
mellitus.  The patient had no known peripheral vascular
disease.  He gives some history of claudication times one
year with left lower extremity pain after walking
approximately one quarter of a mile which resolved with rest.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Rheumatoid arthritis.
2.  Hypertension.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Bowel resection of unknown dates.
2.  Back surgery during World War II.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Atenolol of unknown dose.

ALLERGIES:   The patient had no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient had a social history significant
for a 55 year smoking history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
was afebrile; vital signs are stable.  He was complaining of
pain in the left foot; in no apparent distress.  Alert and
oriented times three.  Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Heart was regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen was
soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremity examination was
significant for a cool and discolored left foot, bilateral
ankle edema, left greater than right.  Left lower extremity
had intact sensation but decreased motor strength, decreased
plantar and dorsiflexion of the foot and decreased to flexion
and extension.  Pulse examination was significant for
palpable carotids bilaterally with no bruits, palpable
femorals bilaterally.  Doppler-able popliteals bilaterally
with biphasic signals.  Biphasic signal on the right dorsalis
pedis and no signal on the left dorsalis pedis.  Monophasic
posterior tibial on the left and a biphasic posterior tibial
on the right.  Rectal examination was heme negative; no
masses noted.

LABORATORY:  On admission, white blood cell count 9.4,
hematocrit 31.6, platelets 302.  Sodium 145, potassium 4.4,
chloride 105, bicarbonate 26.5, BUN 28, creatinine 0.9,
glucose 82, INR of 1.1.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
Vascular Service with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1642**] attending.  Emergent
angiogram was arranged which revealed on [**2828-5-22**], marked
aortoiliac disease with severe stenosis of the proximal left
common iliac artery, occluded left superficial femoral
artery, which reconstituted above the knee and the popliteal
artery on the left which occluded just below the knee joint.
No run off vessels were present proximally, however, there
was reconstitution of a very distal left posterior tibial
artery which supplied the patent but diffusely diseased
plantar branches.  Dorsalis pedis artery was occluded.

A chest x-ray on [**2828-5-22**], revealed bilateral predominantly
lower zone interstitial changes, possibly due to chronic
interstitial fibrosis but no acute cardiopulmonary
abnormalities identified.

The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2828-5-23**],
for femoral to femoral Dacron bypass graft and endarterectomy
of the right common femoral artery.  For a more detailed
account, please see operative report.  In addition,
preoperative Urology consultation was obtained which revealed
a distal urethral stricture.  A Foley catheter was placed and
antibiotics were started as prophylaxis.  Directly
postoperatively, the patient was noted to have no dorsalis
pedis signal in the PACU.  The patient was examined and had
an open fem-fem graft but poor flow to the foot.  The
decision at that time was made to observe.  The left foot
remained cool and mottled with blue toes and a monophasic
posterior tibial signal.

Postoperatively, the patient went to the Vascular Intensive
Care Unit where he was on a Nitroglycerin drip for blood
pressure control.

The patient was transferred to the Floor on [**2828-5-26**].  A
chest x-ray on [**2828-5-29**], was noted to have an opacity in
the retrocardiac region suggestive of pneumonia with a
persistent bilateral interstitial pattern likely due to
congestive heart failure.

On [**2828-5-31**], the patient was taken to the Operating Room
again for a thrombectomy and revision of fem-fem D[**MD Number 9010**]
bypass graft and exploration of the left posterior tibial
artery.  Intraoperatively, the patient was unstable and was
on pressors and it was decided not to persist with the
original plan for distal arterial reconstruction.  The
patient went postoperatively to the Neurological SICU where
he remained intubated and sedated.

Postoperatively, the patient was made ""DO NOT RESUSCITATE""
per family discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1642**].  Postoperatively, the
patient required multiple fluid boluses for unstable
hemodynamics.  The patient continued to be hemodynamically
unstable.  On [**2828-6-1**], the patient, after discussion with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1642**] and family, was made COMFORT MEASURES ONLY.

On [**2828-6-2**], the patient was pronounced.  The time of death
was 01:20 a.m.

Cause of death:  Progressively worse hypoxia, resulting in a
bradycardic arrest.

     INDICATION:  Status post right IJ line placement.  Evaluate position and rule
     out pneumothorax.
     
     FINDINGS:  A new right IJ central line has been inserted and its tip is well
     positioned in the mid SVC.  There is no evidence of any complicating
     pneumothorax.  Bibasilar interstitial changes are again noted.  Slight
     prominence of the upper zone pulmonary vasculature is again demonstrated and
     minimal LV failure cannot be excluded.  No pleural effusions are identified.
     A small triangular calcific density is noted in the left mid zone laterally.
     This could be a pleural or parenchymal lung scar.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory placement of right IJ line.  Appearances otherwise
     unchanged.  Bibasilar interstitial infiltrates again noted.  A small
     triangular calcific density is present in the left mid zone, possibly an old
     granulomatous scar.

     CHEST:
     
     INDICATION: Ischemic left foot. Preoperative evaluation.
     
     FINDINGS: A single AP semi-upright view. No prior comparison study. There is
     evidence of bilateral lower zone interstitial infiltrates. The mid zones also
     appear involved to a lesser degree. There is no evidence of any associated
     pleural effusion. The heart shows slight left ventricular enlargement. The
     aorta is unfolded. The pulmonary vessels show possible slight upper zone
     redistribution and some left heart failure cannot be excluded. The skeletal
     structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION: Bilateral predominantly lower zone interstitial changes. These
     could be due to chronic interstitial fibrosis but clinical and possibly prior
     radiologic correlation would be helpful. No acute cardiopulmonary
     abnormalities are identified.

     RADIOLOGISTS:  Procedure performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 997**], [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 250**], Staff
     Radiologist who was present and supervised procedure.
     
     MEDICATION AND CONTRAST:  180 cc non-ionic contrast administered due to
     patient's generalized debilitation.  25 mcg intravenous fentanyl administered
     in divided doses under constant hemodynamic monitoring.  8 cc 1% subcutaneous
     lidocaine.  3000 units intravenous heparin.
     
     TECHNIQUE/PROCEDURE:  Patient was informed of the details and associated risks
     of the procedure and written consent was obtained.  Patient was placed supine
     on angiographic table and the right common femoral artery was accessed under
     fluoroscopic guidance with a 19-gauge Potts-Cournand double-wall puncture
     needle.  A 0.035-inch [**Last Name (un) 528**] guide wire was advanced and positioned with tip
     in the abdominal aorta and the puncture needle exchanged for a 4-French sheath
     with heparinized saline side-arm flush.  An Omni Flush catheter was then
     advanced over the 0.035-inch wire and positioned with tip at the superior
     abdominal aorta.  Abdominal aortogram was obtained.  The catheter tip was then
     repositioned at the aortic bifurcation and bilateral pelvic arteriograms were
     obtained.  A 0.035-inch angled Glidewire was cautiously advanced into the left
     common iliac artery and then advanced into the left common femoral artery and
     the Omni Flush catheter was advanced over this guide wire.  Serial left lower
     extremity arteriograms were obtained.  Arterial pressure was then measured
     within the left external iliac artery, common iliac artery and aorta with
     pressures measuring 114/73 with mean of 90 mm Hg in the left external iliac
     artery, 114/72 with mean of 90 in the left common iliac artery, and 190/77
     with mean of 119 in the aorta, demonstrating significant pressure gradient.
     Catheter and sheath were then withdrawn and hemostasis obtained.  There were
     no immediate complications and the patient tolerated the procedure well.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is moderate diffuse irregularity, atherosclerotic changes, of
     the infrarenal abdominal aorta.  Bilateral renal arteries appear to be patent
     without significant stenosis.  There is very severe stenosis and
     atherosclerotic disease just beyond the take-off of the left common iliac
     artery.  The right common iliac artery is diffusely diseased.  The left
     internal iliac artery is occluded.  The right internal iliac artery is patent.
      There is diffuse disease of the bilateral external iliac arteries with mild
                                                                 (Over)

     on angiographic table and the right common femoral artery was accessed under
     fluoroscopic guidance with a 19-gauge Potts-Cournand double-wall puncture
     needle.  A 0.035-inch [**Last Name (un) 528**] guide wire was advanced and positioned with tip
     in the abdominal aorta and the puncture needle exchanged for a 4-French sheath
     with heparinized saline side-arm flush.  An Omni Flush catheter was then
     advanced over the 0.035-inch wire and positioned with tip at the superior
     abdominal aorta.  Abdominal aortogram was obtained.  The catheter tip was then
     repositioned at the aortic bifurcation and bilateral pelvic arteriograms were
     obtained.  A 0.035-inch angled Glidewire was cautiously advanced into the left
     common iliac artery and then advanced into the left common femoral artery and
     the Omni Flush catheter was advanced over this guide wire.  Serial left lower
     extremity arteriograms were obtained.  Arterial pressure was then measured
     within the left external iliac artery, common iliac artery and aorta with
     pressures measuring 114/73 with mean of 90 mm Hg in the left external iliac
     artery, 114/72 with mean of 90 in the left common iliac artery, and 190/77
     with mean of 119 in the aorta, demonstrating significant pressure gradient.
     Catheter and sheath were then withdrawn and hemostasis obtained.  There were
     no immediate complications and the patient tolerated the procedure well.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is moderate diffuse irregularity, atherosclerotic changes, of
     the infrarenal abdominal aorta.  Bilateral renal arteries appear to be patent
     without significant stenosis.  There is very severe stenosis and
     atherosclerotic disease just beyond the take-off of the left common iliac
     artery.  The right common iliac artery is diffusely diseased.  The left
     internal iliac artery is occluded.  The right internal iliac artery is patent.
      There is diffuse disease of the bilateral external iliac arteries with mild
                                                                 (Over)

     diffuse disease of the left common femoral artery.  The left profunda femoral
     artery is patent.  The left superficial femoral artery is occluded, and
     reconstitutes a diffusely diseased distal superficial femoral artery at the
     adductor canal.  The above-knee popliteal artery is patent but diffusely
     diseased and popliteal artery occludes just below the knee.  The tibioperoneal
     trunk is occluded and no named proximal runoff vessels are demonstrated. There
     is reconstitution of a very distal posterior tibial artery supplying patent
     but diffusely diseased plantar branches.  There is no opacification of the
     left dorsalis pedis artery.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Marked, severe, aortoiliac disease with severe stenosis of the
     proximal left common iliac artery.  Occluded left superficial femoral artery.
     Reconstituted above-knee left popliteal artery which occludes just below the
     knee joint.  No named runoff [**Name2 (NI) 491**] are present proximally, however, there is
     reconstitution of a very distal left posterior tibial artery which supplies
     patent but diffusely diseased plantar branches.  The dorsalis pedis artery is
     occluded.

     COMPARISON:  [**2828-5-23**].
     
     A right-sided central venous line is present with its tip in the mid to lower
     SVC, unchanged.  Multiple wires overlie the patient.  The heart size and
     mediastinal contour are within normal limits.  There has been interval
     improvement in the bilateral mid and lower lung zone interstitial infiltrates,
     right greater than left.  A nodular opacity is again noted within the left
     upper to mid lung zone likely representing a calcified granuloma and/or
     scarring.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Slight improvement in the bilateral interstitial infiltrate.
     Nodular opacity within the left mid to upper lung zone likely represents a
     small calcified granuloma.  Comparison with the prior radiographs is
     recommended to demonstrate interval stability.

     INDICATION: Leukocytosis.
     
     PA AND LATERAL CHEST: Comparison to the prior study of [**2828-5-25**], there
     is increasing density within the bilateral retrocardiac region, particularly
     on the right. In the interval since the prior study, a right IJ line has been
     removed. There is a nodular density at the peripheral left upper lung field,
     consistent with a granuloma. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.
     The heart size is within normal limits. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
     also normal. Diffuse interstitial prominence persists. There is no upper lung
     zone redistribution.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Increasing opacity in retrocardiac region, suggestive of pneumonia.
     2. Persistent bilateral interstitial pattern, likely due to CHF. There may be
     an underlying component of chronic interstitial disease, and follow-up CXR
     after diuresis would be helpful to evaluate for this possibility.

     distended. The Swan-Ganz catheter in the right ventricular outflow tract and a
     nasogastric tube terminates in the upper abdomen with a side port near the GE
     junction level. The heart remains enlarged and there is persistent vascular
     engorgement and perihilar haziness.  A bilateral interstitial pattern is seen,
     likely superimposed upon chronic underlying changes of emphysema.  A more
     focal oval shaped dense opacity is seen at the level of the left third
